        "content": "[11:02 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in 04-1324, Day versus McDonough.\nMr. Busby.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF J. BRETT BUSBY\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. BUSBY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe State does not dispute that it waived\nthe affirmative defense of limitations by failing to\nraise it in the District Court and by conceding in its\nanswer that Day's petition was timely. Yet, nearly a\nyear into the case, after the parties had briefed the\nmerits, the magistrate judge not only raised an\nargument that the petition was untimely, he actually\nimposed the State's limitations defense and dismissed\nthe case, despite the State's procedural default and\ncontrary concession.\nThat was error, for two reasons. First, it\nviolates the general principle of the adversary system\nin the civil rules that it's error to impose a\nforfeited limitations defense sua sponte, and the\nstatutory text in rules have confirmed that this\nprinciple applies to habeas. Second, the State's\nconcession of timeliness based on full information was\nan express binding waiver, and it was error for the\nDistrict Court to override that concession.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was a computation\nerror. This is not a -- this is not a case where the\nState chose to waive the statute of limitations. It\nmiscalculated. Isn't that the case?\nMR. BUSBY: Well, there was a 1-day\nmiscalculation, Justice Ginsburg, on the -- on the 352\nversus 353 days before the -- Mr. Day filed his State\npostconviction petition. But there's a legal dispute\nas to whether the days after -- between the time --\nwhether the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we're not -- and we\ndidn't take cert to decide if this claim was timely.\nWe are on the assumption that it was untimely. But --\nand what are the consequences of the State's failing\nto raise that?\nMR. BUSBY: Well, our position is that by\nexpressly conceding in their petition that it was\ntimely, that that's an express waiver. I mean, they\nsay that they would have -- what they would have had\nto say was, \"We know we have a limitations defense.\nWe're expressly giving that up, that the proper\nstandard is the intentional relinquishment of\" --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the --\nMR. BUSBY: -- \"a known right.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the whole basis was\nthe number of days that they calculated, and the\nmagistrate said, \"Oh, they miscalculated. There were\nmore days involved.\"\nMR. BUSBY: The -- yes, under Eleventh\nCircuit law, the magistrate said they should have\ncounted that additional time at the end.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. BUSBY: But this Court has said that the\nstandard for -- the standard for express waiver\nvaries, depending on the right at stake. It's not\nalways intentional relinquishment of a known right, as\nit is with some constitutional rights.\nIn fact, there are several Courts of Appeals\nthat have said when you plead -- when you\naffirmatively plead the opposite of an affirmative\ndefense, as they did here by saying it's timely, that\nthat's enough for an express waiver. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose --\nMR. BUSBY: -- this Court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the magistrate\njudge had said, \"I notice this error in accordance\nwith Eleventh Circuit law, so I am going to suggest to\nthe State that they amend their answer.\" The State\ncertainly could -- under Rule 15, if the Federal rules\napply, the State could have amended its answer and\ndone just what the magistrate judge did.\nMR. BUSBY: Well, certainly, Your Honor,\nthey could have moved to amend their answer. We would\nhave opposed it; and would, on remand, if the issue\nwere to come up, on the ground that they had full\ninformation, and so that this is not an appropriate\ncase to amend an answer. But I agree with you that\nthat would have been one option, and that's the way\nthat the Third Circuit analyzes this issue in the Long\ncase and in the Bendolph case, using the principles of\nRule 15. The Fifth -- the Eleventh Circuit did not do\nthat here. It said that there was an obligation for\nthe court to impose the limitations defense; it did\nnot apply the Rule 15 --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I --\nMR. BUSBY: -- analysis.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did it say \"an\nobligation,\" or that the court \"could\"? It didn't --\nI didn't think it said the court \"must.\"\nMR. BUSBY: It did say, Your Honor, that\nthere was an obligation for the court to impose it to\nfurther comity, finality, and federalism, and that can\nbe found on page 5(a) of the appendix to the petition,\n\"A Federal Court that sits in collateral review has an\nobligation to enforce the Federal statute of\nlimitations.\" And, in fact, they quote the Advisory\nCommittee notes to Rule 4, saying the court has the\nduty to screen out. And they also expressly\ndistinguished their precedent in Esslinger versus\nDavis, which relied on Granberry versus Greer, to say\nit was a discretionary analysis. They said, \"We're\nnot going to consider the discretionary issues raised\nin Esslinger and Granberry whether this dismissal\nwould serve an important Federal interest. We're just\ngoing to say there's an obligation to impose this, and\nthat the District\" --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is -- I see --\nyou're referring to page 4(a) and --\nMR. BUSBY: 5(a), Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. Which -- where is\nthe sentence that says it -- that --\nMR. BUSBY: The obligation is seven lines\nfrom the bottom, and it's that last paragraph, where\nthey're distinguishing Esslinger. And the sentence of\nthe previous paragraph is where they say there's a\n\"duty.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that that duty\nis in connection with Rule 4.\nMR. BUSBY: Yes, Your Honor, and then they -\n- they rely on that duty to say that there is an\nobligation, in the next paragraph, and to\ndistinguishing Essingler and say, \"We don't have to go\nthrough this discretionary analysis, because there's\nan obligation.\"\nAnd so, our position is that even --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, the -- it's right that\nthere's an obligation if it notices it in the first\ninstance on its first review.\nMR. BUSBY: Well, we don't necessarily\nagree, Your Honor, if -- we don't necessarily agree\nthat --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And suppose, under the\nreview proceedings, that District Court is looking at\nit for the first time, without yet having required a\nresponse, and he sees a statute of limitation. I\nassume there's an obligation.\nMR. BUSBY: Under Rule 4?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Sure.\nMR. BUSBY: Well, Your Honor, if you'd look\nat what rule --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, if -- suppose it's\nan open-and-shut violation of the statute of\nlimitations, or barred by the statute of limitations -\n-\nMR. BUSBY: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- does District Court\nhave discretion to refer to the State for a response?\nMR. BUSBY: Yes, Your Honor, we would say\nthat --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Really?\nMR. BUSBY: -- that they must do that,\nbecause, as this Court recognized in Pliler versus\nFord, it's almost never apparent on the face of the\npetition --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, my --\nMR. BUSBY: -- that there's an --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, my --\nMR. BUSBY: -- open-and-shut --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- my hypothetical is that\nit is.\nMR. BUSBY: Okay. I would think that even\nif it were apparent on the face of the petition, that\nthe -- Rule 4 has two parts. In the first part of it,\nthe nonadversary screening function, only applies when\nthe petitioner is plainly not entitled to relief. And\nI think the better view of that -- of that clause is -\n- although there are some arguments in our brief that\ndon't take this view -- I -- after having given it\nthought, I think the better view of that clause is\nthat it does not apply to an affirmative defense\nthat's subject to waiver or tolling, that you can't\nsay, based on an affirmative defense that's subject to\nwaiver or tolling, that someone is plainly not\nentitled to relief. You could say, for example --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because the other --\nbecause the other side might make a mistake and not\nrecognize it?\nMR. BUSBY: Or it might be tolled, Your\nHonor. And there are also four different trigger\ndates in the statute for when it can first apply, that\nyou aren't going to be able to tell, necessarily,\nthree of them from the face of the petition.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or the other side may say,\n\"Although technically the statute of limitations\napplied here, taking all considerations into account\nwe think that this prisoner acted with reasonable\npromptness, and perhaps the delay was somewhat\nattributable to the State.\" Do you think that that's\na proper consideration?\nMR. BUSBY: Absolutely, Your Honor. There -\n- the statute of limitations in AEDPA is designed to\nprevent delay, not to -- as Congress has said, it's\nnot a forfeiture provision; it's designed to move\nthese complaints along speedily, particularly in\ncapital cases, of which this is not one.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you -- it could be\nargued that the Federal Government wants to move them\nalong speedily, whether or not the State government\nwants to.\nMR. BUSBY: Certainly. And their --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, that would suggest that\nthe State's voluntary waiver of a statute of\nlimitations should not make any difference. It's a\nFederal -- it's a Federal interest involved, not a\nState interest.\nMR. BUSBY: Well, they -- there is an\ninterest in judicial efficiency that's at issue here,\ntoo, but we submit that it's far more inefficient for\nthe Court to put limitations under this first category\nof Rule 4 and say that the Court must, on its own,\nlook at limitations every time, without assistance\nfrom the parties, than it is to make the State do its\njob. I mean, they're the ones, as this --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we could --\nMR. BUSBY: -- Court recognized --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- we could -- we could\nagree with you that there is isn't an obligation on\nthe Federal judge to raise it, but the question is,\nyou know, the -- it could be a \"must,\" it can be \"may\nnot,\" or it could be \"may.\"\nMR. BUSBY: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And why shouldn't we\ntreat this as a \"may\"? The judge noticed the clerical\nerror and called it to the party's attention by an\norder to show cause.\nMR. BUSBY: Well, the proper procedure under\nRule 4 is not to call it to the party's attention in\nthat way; it's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We're past Rule 4,\nbecause an answer has been ordered.\nMR. BUSBY: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- and it's only when\nthe answer comes in that this issue is spotted.\nMR. BUSBY: Yes. That's correct. And I\nagree with you that the proper procedure after that\nwould be to bring the issue to the party's attention\nand let the State decide whether it wanted to file a\nmotion to amend under Rule 15; and, if it did so,\nthere are very clear standards that are applied, that\nwere not applied in this case, to decide --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There are very what\nstandards?\nMR. BUSBY: There are very clear standards,\nYour Honor --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, \"leave shall be\nfreely given.\"\nMR. BUSBY: Yes, but there are also -- it's\na -- again, it's a discretionary determination, and\nthere are prejudice issues that should be considered\nas the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what would be the\nprejudice that could be claimed by the habeas\npetitioner?\nMR. BUSBY: Well, the prejudice in this case\nis that the standards of Rule 15 were not considered;\nbut, in addition, there are -- there are well-\nrecognized decisions, both from this Court and from\nthe Courts of Appeals, that went -- that says a judge\nmay deny leave to amend when the -- at the time the\nconcession is made. And the answer -- the State had\nfull information. And the State admits here that it\nhad all the information it needed to make the\nlimitations calculation attached to its answer, in\nwhich it conceded timeliness, and then -- but then\nwaited a year, or several months, to bring it up\nlater. And so, we would argue, if this were a Rule 15\nanalysis, that it would not be appropriate for the\nCourt to allow the amendment.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are you --\nMR. BUSBY: Now, also --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are you saying that the\nerror is simply that it wasn't done via Rule 15? What\nif we were to say that the same considerations apply\nwhen it's simply raised sua sponte by the -- by the --\nby the District Court? What would be your objection\nto that?\nMR. BUSBY: Well, that would be -- that's\nthe Respondent's position, and I think, in addition to\nthose considerations, if you disagree that this is a\nforfeiture, that -- and you disagree that this is an\nexpress waiver, and you get to their position that,\nyou know, this is a discretionary test and you should\njust apply the same Rule 15 factors, I think you need\nto also apply a presumption against sua sponte\nconsideration.\nThere's one way to do it under Rule 4, and\nthat's the most efficient way. It's also the way that\ncomports with judicial neutrality in the adversary\nsystem. And so, to encourage people --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you couldn't do this\nunder Rule 4, because, as you, I think, recognized,\nthat, just from the petition, from the habeas\npetition, you couldn't tell.\nMR. BUSBY: I'm sorry, Justice --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There wasn't --\nMR. BUSBY: -- Ginsburg, I misspoke. I\nmeant to say Rule 15. But if -- to encourage parties\nto do this under Rule 15, the Court should adopt a\npresumption against sua sponte consideration. And\nthis -- in Arizona versus California, which they rely\non heavily, they say that this type of consideration\nshould be reserved for rare circumstances. And we\ncite several cases in our brief where that -- that\nalso support that proposition. So, we would submit,\nif you do get to this analysis, Justice Alito, that\nthere should also be a presumption involved.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if you think it's --\nif it's done under Rule 15, would the considerations\nnecessarily be exactly the same in a habeas case as in\nan ordinary civil case?\nMR. BUSBY: Not necessarily. I mean, there\n-- but we do submit that the timing issue that we just\nraised, about them having full information, would\ncertainly be something we'd argue to the District\nCourt in its discretion. But another thing you have\nto consider, to your point, is that limitations is\nsomething that's -- that has a subtle meaning and\nderive -- and is directly addressed by Civil Rules 8\nand 12. And this Court, in Gonzalez and Mayle, says\nthat when that happens, that's where you start, with\nthe civil rules. And then you ask if there's anything\nin the habeas statutes or rules that's inconsistent\nwith that approach, with the -- with the forfeiture\napproach of the civil rules.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but the civil rules\nallow for amendment.\nMR. BUSBY: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's 8(c), and there's\n12(b), but there's also 15.\nMR. BUSBY: Yes, I agree. And that was not\nused in this case. I -- and I -- we agree that that\nwould be an appropriate way to raise this.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It seems the height of\ntechnicality to say that the judge could suggest,\n\"Now, State, I will entertain a motion to amend the\nanswer, under Rule 15,\" instead of saying, \"I'm\nissuing an order to show cause why this action is not\nout of time.\"\nMR. BUSBY: Well, I don't agree, Your Honor,\nbecause there's a specific analysis that goes along\nwith Rule 15 that wasn't applied here. But, in\naddition to that, there's an efficiency interest to be\nserved by having the State calculate and make the\nmotion, rather than putting the burden on the Federal\nCourt to do it. The Court, we submit, should make the\nState -- they -- this Court, in Pliler, said the\nState's in the best position to make the limitations\ncalculation. It's an error-prone fact-intensive,\nburdensome calculation, and they shouldn't be allowed\nto foist that burden on the Court. The Court should\nmake them do their job.\nAnd so, our position is that that's the\nreason that it should be done under Rule 15. It also\ndoesn't put the State in the position of being an\nadvocate -- excuse me -- it doesn't put the Court in\nthe position of being an advocate for the State and\nhaving them say -- having the Court directly across\nthe bench from the Petitioner, not involving the\nState, saying, \"Here are -- I'm developing some\narguments on behalf of the State now why this is\nuntimely. What do you have to say about it?\" That's\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why does -- proceeding\nunder 15 does not do that; whereas, proceeding this\nway does?\nMR. BUSBY: Well, proceeding under 15, I --\nproceeding under 15, you would say to the State, \"Do\nyou want to make a motion to amend?\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wink, wink?\nMR. BUSBY: Well -- but --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, there is some value\nin that, I think, particularly where the State has\nexpressly conceded timeliness. I mean, the magistrate\njudge in this case, all that he had before him was the\nexpress concession from the State. He never -- the\nState never said anything in the District Court, even\nafter he issued his notice to the Petitioner to show\ncause why it wasn't untimely. So, the magistrate\njudge, all he had before him was the State's position\nthat it was timely.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that concern\npresent in Granberry, as well? And yet, the Court\nreached the opposite result there.\nMR. BUSBY: I don't think so, Your Honor,\nbecause in Granberry the State raised the issue for\nthe first time on appeal, the court did not. So,\nthere, you do have the adversary system at work. In\naddition, Granberry is different for several other\nreasons. Exhaustions is, unlike limitations, unique\nto habeas corpus; it's not covered by Rule 8. And,\nalso, it's a common-law limit that this Court has\ndeveloped on habeas relief. It's not a statutory\naffirmative defense. And, as our brief points out,\nCongress has treated these very differently when it\ncodified them in AEDPA. And this applies not only to\nexhaustion, but nonretroactivity, abuse of the writ,\nand procedural default. I'm sorry, procedural default\nwas not codified. But they other defenses -- the\nother limits on habeas relief that the Petitioner\nrelies on were codified very differently in AEDPA;\nwhereas, for exhaustion it says, \"Relief shall not be\ngranted unless you exhaust.\" That's a substantive\nlimit on relief.\nFor limitations, however, it says when\nyou're --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One that requires\nthe court to raise it sua sponte, even if it's not\nraised by the State.\nMR. BUSBY: I beg your pardon?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One that requires\nthe court to raise it sua sponte, even if not raised\nby the State, correct?\nMR. BUSBY: Potentially, yes, if you codify\nit as a substantive limit on relief. Whereas,\nlimitations is simply codified -- it says, \"a period\nof limitations shall apply.\" It doesn't say, \"Relief\nshall not be granted unless you file within one year.\"\nIt doesn't even say, as it does in the capital\ncontext, for certain -- for capital opt-in States,\nthat it must be filed by a certain time. It just says\n\"a period of limitation.\" And that has a settled\nmeaning that goes along with it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your position is, it should\nbe like any other civil case.\nMR. BUSBY: Yes, Your Honor. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You can raise it sua\nsponte, we've said, in exceptional circumstances.\nMR. BUSBY: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know what they are.\nMR. BUSBY: Well, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if --\nMR. BUSBY: -- I'm not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- they're not there --\nMR. BUSBY: One --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- then the judge could\nsay, \"You know, I'm surprised that you haven't raised\nstatute of limitations.\"\nMR. BUSBY: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then the lawyer for the\nState says, \"Oh, my goodness. Quite right. We'd like\nto amend.\"\nMR. BUSBY: Certainly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And we don't --\nMR. BUSBY: And there could be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- have to decide --\nMR. BUSBY: -- good reasons to amend. For\nexample, the Bendolph case that you have before you,\nthere was an alteration in a date, and the Third\nCircuit didn't ascribe that to any particular person,\nbut, nonetheless, the documents that the State had\nbefore it had the wrong date on it from which to\ncalculate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Must there be good reasons\nfor the judge to say, quote, \"I'm surprised that you\nhaven't raised a statute of limitations defense\"?\nMR. BUSBY: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Must there be good reason\nfor that? And, if not, aren't you asking us to waste\nour time?\nMR. BUSBY: I don't think so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't you do it the\neasier way and --\nMR. BUSBY: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nYou're -- if you put -- if you put limitations as\nsomething that the judge must raise, I think you're\nasking the judge to waste his time rather than leaving\nit to the parties to raise it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what's your answer as\nto whether there is any limitation on the judge just\nsuggesting, \"By the way, you know, is there some\nreason why you haven't pleaded statute of\nlimitations?\" Can a -- can a judge do that?\nMR. BUSBY: Well, I would think that, you\nknow, it would be evaluated under an abuse-of-\ndiscretion standard, and I haven't -- I haven't given\nmuch --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And what -- when would it\nbe an abuse of discretion?\nMR. BUSBY: For a judge to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. BUSBY: -- invite the State to amend?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. BUSBY: I would say if -- it would be,\nin this case, perhaps, because of the State's express\nconcession to the contrary, and -- so that that might\nbe one circumstance. But I don't think this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it wouldn't --\nMR. BUSBY: -- Court needs to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- be an abuse of --\nMR. BUSBY: -- circumscribe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It wouldn't be an\nabuse of discretion for him to suggest an amendment if\nhe's got the opportunity to rule on the amendment\nlater on. And then presumably the ruling would be\nreviewed for abuse of discretion.\nMR. BUSBY: That's a good point, Your Honor.\nI don't think this Court needs to circumscribe the\njudge's authority to suggest an amendment. I think\nyou could wrap it all into the ruling and evaluate\nthat for abuse of discretion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I suppose it might be an\nabuse of discretion if you'd already had a hearing and\ntook -- and decided that there was merit to the\nplaintiff's claim, and then decided, \"Well, now I'm\ngoing to just throw it out on limitations,\" might be\nan abuse of discretion.\nMR. BUSBY: I would agree with that, yes,\nYour Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why\ndoesn't that same standard apply to the decision of\nthe Court to raise it sua sponte?\nMR. BUSBY: Well, because in this case you\nhave an express concession. And so, it's a -- this\nCourt has said, and other courts have said, that when\nyou have an express concession, it's error to override\nthat concession and impose the defense sua sponte.\nThe Court should, instead, assume that the concession\nis valid and that refusal to honor it is an abuse of\ndiscretion. You --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Were those --\nMR. BUSBY: -- don't want to strip --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- cases -- were those\ncases of a miscalculation on the part of the State?\nThe judge's view was that the State had miscalculated\nunder eleventh-amendment -- under Eleventh Circuit\nprecedent.\nMR. BUSBY: Well, Your Honor, most of those\ncases involved other issues, like exhaustion and\nprocedural default, where the State later came back\nand said, \"We were mistaken that they exhausted,\" or,\n\"We were mistaken that they didn't procedurally\ndefault this claim.\" So, it's a similar mistake\nclaim, but, nonetheless, the State affirmatively\npleaded the opposite of either exhaustion, procedural\ndefault, or limitations. And the court held them to\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, you'd say it would be\nokay if the State didn't expressly concede the statute\nof limitations point.\nMR. BUSBY: Possibly. But, again, I think\nif you -- if you use the analysis of the civil rules\nthat applies here, by virtue of Civil Rule 81 and\nHabeas Rule 11, that it's error -- our first position\nis that it's error to override the forfeiture --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's --\nMR. BUSBY: -- except in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I thought your\n--\nMR. BUSBY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- position was.\nMR. BUSBY: Except in exceptional --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So, this --\nMR. BUSBY: -- circumstances.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- a fallback position.\nMR. BUSBY: Yes. That's correct. And then\nour second fallback position is that even if Your --\neven if Your Honors agree that the court could -- has\ndiscretion to override the express waiver, that\nthere's at least a discretionary analysis that has to\napply under Civil Rule 15 that's coupled with a\npresumption in -- against sua sponte dismissal that\nthe Eleventh Circuit didn't apply here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why, just out of curiosity\n-- I'm not familiar with the actual practice of a lot\nof civil cases, but when somebody -- let's say the\ndefendant in an ordinary tort case forgets to put in\nthe statute of limitations, and the case is all tried\nand finished. At the very end, he says, \"Oh, my God.\"\nAnd now he goes in and asks to amend it under Rule\n15. Do judges normally say, \"Fine\"?\nMR. BUSBY: I -- they normally say no, that\nthat's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because it's --\nMR. BUSBY: The -- because the case has gone\non down the road on another theory, and it's\nprejudicial to the parties, and it wastes -- it's a\nwaste of the court's judicial resources to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But here, nothing --\nMR. BUSBY: -- bring it up.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- happened. Nothing\nhappened. There was --\nMR. BUSBY: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The answer was put in,\nand then there were no further proceedings. Nothing\nelse went on in the court.\nMR. BUSBY: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's quite different -- I\ndon't know any judge that would allow a defendant,\nafter the trial is over, to raise the statute of\nlimitations. But, up front, it's a different\nsituation.\nMR. BUSBY: Well, we disagree that this was\nup front, Your Honor. The answer in a -- habeas\ncorpus cases, of course, heavily deals with the\nmerits, as it did in this case. And then, Mr. Day\nreplied. And, as the State's amicus brief points out,\nthat's all that usually happens in most habeas corpus\ncases. So, we were near the end of the proceeding, as\n-- if you think of the run-of-the-mine habeas corpus\ncase.\nAnd, also, speaking of run-of-the-mine\nhabeas corpus cases, this is a very rare instance.\nThere are -- there are lots of procedures for courts\nto vindicate the interest that the State describes in\ncomity, finality, and federalism, whether inviting a\nmotion to -- whether ordering the State to file a\nmotion to dismiss under Rule 4, which we submit would\nbe the proper procedure, or, if the State fails to\nraise it in its answer in certain circumstances,\ninviting them to file a motion to amend under Rule 15.\nThat takes care of these interests in the run-of-the-\nmine case.\nThere's no need to vindicate those interests\nin this case by creating an exception to the rules.\nThis Court has said, in Lonchar and in Carlisle, that\nwhere there are civil rules that deal with the -- and\nhabeas rules -- that deal with how these things\nhappen, the Court cannot use its inherent powers to\ncircumvent those rules. And we submit that that's\nexactly what the court did here.\nNow, in addition, I'd like to point the\nCourt to New York versus Hill, which is not cited in\nour briefs, but can be found at 528 U.S. at 114 to -15\nand also 118, on this express waiver issue. And this\nis a case where the Court recognized exactly the point\nthat we make here, that not all -- you don't always\nhave to show intentional relinquishment of a known\nright for that to be the standard for waiver. It\ndepends on the right at issue. There, it was an\nInternational Agreement on Detainers Act case, and the\nCourt held that the -- that the defendant's assent to\ndelay waived the time limitation of the Interstate\nAgreement on Detainers Act, expressly waived it. And\nthat's our -- that's our position here, is that the\nState's affirmative pleading of timeliness is an\nexpress waiver.\nIn addition, the State could -- certainly\ncouldn't prevail, under the Brady versus U.S. standard\nthat applies to plea agreements, for saying that its\nconcession was not knowing. There's no -- there's no\nsuggestion here that the State was misled. There's no\nsuggestion that they didn't have all the information\nthey needed to make the calculation. And Brady says\nthat simply misapprehending a factor -- a relevant\nfactor in the analysis is not enough. And that's at\n397 U.S. at page 757.\nIn addition, the State makes an argument\nabout policies beyond the concerns of the parties, and\nthat the State -- that those should be vindicated in\nthis case. But I'd like to point out that this Court\nhas not adopted the \"beyond the concerns of the\nparties\" test; rather, it's acknowledged that Congress\nentrusts even important public policies, like comity,\nfinality, and federalism, to the adversary process;\nand, thus, their -- and even private rights that\nbenefit society can be waived, in Christiansburg\nGarment, for example.\nWith the Court's permission, I'd like to\nreserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Kise.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER M. KISE\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. KISE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe District Court's sua sponte action here\nwas consistent with AEDPA and the habeas rules. It\nwas consistent with this Court's habeas jurisprudence.\nAnd it was consistent with the purpose behind, and\nnot prohibited by, Federal Rules 8 and 12.\nThis case is not about the State's waiver.\nAnd we would agree that -- with Justice Scalia, that\nthe waiver is not the beginning and end of it. We're\nnot conceding that the State, in fact, waived it here,\nbut we're saying that that's not essential to the\nanswer to this question, because it's not the\nbeginning and the end of the analysis.\nThis case is also not about, as the\nPetitioner alleges in the brief and makes inference on\nthe Eleventh Circuit's opinion, about obligating\ncourts to act in all circumstances.\nThis case is about the proper exercise of\ndiscretion. And what we're really asking this Court\nto do is really three things: to acknowledge again\nthat this authority exists, to say that this is when\nthe court may exercise that authority under the\ncircumstances presented by this case, And then,\nthirdly, that this is how the Court goes about\nexercising this authority, by providing notice and\nopportunity to be heard, and conducting an analysis of\nprejudice. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think the court \"must.\"\nMR. KISE: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, don't you think\nthat's what this court thought? And, if so, shouldn't\nwe perhaps send it back to see whether, if the court\nknew that it had discretion, it would have done this?\nMR. KISE: Your Honor, respectfully, I don't\nthink that that's what the Eleventh Circuit thought.\nI think that that is an interpretation of the Eleventh\nCircuit's language. However, I think that where the\nphrase that Counsel pointed to in the opinion -- on\npage 5(a), referencing \"obligation\" -- I believe that\nthe Court there was referring to, specifically under\nRule 4, that the court has this obligation. I think\nit -- because it's in that discussion that the Court\nis talking about the obligation. And I would submit\nthat, indeed, under Rule 4, in response, I believe, to\nJustice -- a point Justice Kennedy raised, I would say\nthat, under Rule 4, I think it is obligation. I think\nwhat Rule 4 is, is a reflection of Congress -- excuse\nme -- of the rule advising the court that, \"You must\nexercise this authority that you already have at this\nparticular time. This is the time when you need to be\nlooking for these things.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but, Mr. Kise, the -\n- Mr. Busby told us that the reference was in the\nfollowing paragraph, and it is the sentence, \"A\nFederal Court that sits in collateral review of a\ncriminal judgment of a State Court has an obligation\nto enforce the Federal statute of limitations.\"\nThat's the sentence that suggests that the Court of\nAppeals thought that there was an obligation, the\nDistrict Court, to raise the statute of limitations on\nits own motion.\nMR. KISE: Your Honor -- and I was referring\nto that sentence, and perhaps I wasn't clear, but I\nwould -- I would say that they are still talking about\nRule 4. But even if they're not talking about Rule 4,\neven if, in fact, this Court believes that the\nDistrict -- that the Circuit Court's analysis is\nflawed, then we must keep in mind that this Court is\nreviewing judgments, not opinions. And this Court\ncould easily do what it did in Gonzalez, which is,\neven though the analysis is not consistent with what\nthis Court -- I mean, frankly, if the Court takes that\nview with what we're asking the Court to do here --\nbut you can nevertheless affirm the judgment. Because\nthe District Court did, in fact, get it right. The --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What --\nMR. KISE: -- District Court --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What would you say --\nassuming that we're beyond Rule 4, what would you say\nsimply to a rule that said, \"Yes, we recognize that\nthere remains a discretion -- not an obligation, but a\ndiscretion -- on the part of the court to raise this.\"\nBut, just as a -- as a general rule, judicial\nefficiency is better served by avoiding the use of\ndiscretion unless the State, in fact, raises the\nlimitations issue, itself. The courts have a lot of\nthings to do, and they shouldn't be spending their\ntime canvassing pleadings to see whether there might\nbe an issue that the State missed; so that in the\nabsence of some extraordinary circumstance, it would\nbe an abuse of discretion to exercise it as the -- as\nthe Circuit suggests it should have been exercised\nhere. What would you say to that position?\nMR. KISE: I would say, respectfully, Your\nHonor, that that is somewhat inconsistent, if not\nentirely inconsistent, with what this Court said in\nGranberry and Caspari, dealing with the same sort of\nraising of affirmative defenses. From that\nstandpoint, from a procedural standpoint, I would say\nthat Granberry and Caspari are procedurally\nindistinct, in that this Court said that it is\nappropriate, in these circumstances, for the court to\nlook at affirmative defenses. Obviously, they have\nsubstantive differences, which my -- which Counsel has\npointed out, but, from a procedural standpoint, were\nthe Petitioner to prevail here, I would think this\nCourt needs to recede procedurally from Granberry and\nCaspari --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What --\nMR. KISE: -- because the Court --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What, then, would be the\nsignificance here of the fact that the State conceded\nthat there was no limitations problem? In a case like\nthat, wouldn't it be a good rule to avoid judicial\ninquiry?\nMR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, I think that\nthe State's concession, as Justice Scalia pointed out,\nis not the beginning and end of it, in the first\ninstance. Secondly, it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it bears on the\nexercise of discretion.\nMR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor, it does. And we\nwould agree that it bears on the exercise of\ndiscretion. And, in a circumstance such as this one,\nwhere the attachments, the record itself, indicated\nthat there was a discrepancy between the position the\nState was taking and what the record actually\nreflected, it was appropriate for the District Court\nto raise the issue and then consider the interests of\nthe parties. If the District Court had been presented\nsimply with nothing in the record, just a blanket\nstatement by the -- by Florida that, \"We concede,\" and\nthere was nothing to raise the question, then we would\n-- we would say that it's not appropriate for the\ncourt to simply pull issues out of the sky.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That would be an abuse.\nMR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor. I would say\nthat it would be an abuse.\nJUSTICE BREYER: District judges can't\ncomment on the cases? And -- they suddenly raise\nsomething, curious about something; and, lo and\nbehold, it becomes the subject of an amendment.\nMR. KISE: Well, Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's a violation of -- I\nmean, what I'm driving at is, I don't really\nunderstand Rule 15 thoroughly, because I'm not a trial\nlawyer. And why do we have to decide every matter?\nWhy don't we let the District judge free to run his\ntrial and just say, \"Hey, we don't want to proliferate\nlaw. It's complicated enough already. Let's leave it\nto Rule 15, whatever that might be\"?\nMR. KISE: I think leaving it to Rule 15 is\none way to do it. And doing it in these particular\ncases is another way. Giving the courts discretion to\nraise the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but the other way\nmeans we're now going to have a new area of law. The\nnew area of law consists of habeas law involving what\nis the equivalent of an amendment suggested by the\njudge to bring up a statute. That would be good,\nbecause West would then have five more pages, with a\nnew keynote --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and there would be more\nfor lawyers to look up. Whereas, if you just say Rule\n15, it's finished.\nMR. KISE: Respectfully, Your Honor, I\nbelieve this Court's already done that, though, in\nGranberry and Caspari. I mean, that's what you've\nalready said, is that, under -- that habeas is\ndifferent. And I think it's important to point out,\nwe're not asking for a different construction of Rules\n8 and 12. We're asking this Court to apply the same\nexception that is applied in the extraordinary case.\nThe Petitioner takes the position -- and Petitioner is\nalone in this contention -- that \"ordinarily\" means\n\"never.\" Even the law professor amici don't take\nposition, and there is not a case that we have been\nable to locate in the country that says that\n\"ordinarily\" means \"never,\" that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you say it's --\nMR. KISE: -- the ordinary rule --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- means it's \"hardly\never\"? I mean, we do follow the principle of party\npresentation. And judges are not supposed to be\nintruding issues on their own, they are supposed to\nfollow the party's presentation. So, would this be --\nif it's not \"never,\" would it be at least \"hardly\never,\" that it's appropriate for a judge to interject\nan affirmative defense on his own motion?\nMR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor, I would say that\nit is \"hardly ever,\" and that's what we're dealing\nwith here. It's what the Court was dealing with in\nGranberry and Caspari, these limited circumstances\nwhere the interests transcend the interests of just\nthe parties before the court and where it is, from the\n-- from a review of the record, as District judges do\nevery day looking at the record and identifying\nissues, and to avoid the sort of conundrum that's\npresented by the Petitioner agreeing that the District\njudge could simply look at the State and, as Justice\nScalia said, wink, wink, \"It's okay for you to raise\nthis issue now,\" to avoid the roundabout that is\noccasioned by that. If it is, in fact, permissible in\nthese circumstances for the District Court to raise\nthe issue, then doing it the way the court did it\nhere, and the way that was approved in Bendolph, and\nthe way that we believe the Eleventh Circuit approved\nit, is entirely appropriate, because it's consistent\nwith what this Court said in its habeas jurisprudence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if Congress wanted to\nleave it to the State to waive the statute of\nlimitations provision? How could it have made that\nclear? I mean, I would have thought that if they made\nit a statute of limitations provision instead of a\njurisdictional provision -- I mean, they could have\nsaid, you know, \"No jurisdiction if it's filed beyond\na certain date, and we mean it.\" But it put it as a\nstatute of limitation, which normally is waivable.\nAnd I would think that that is an indication that\nCongress thought, \"Really, if the State thinks that in\nthis particular case we shouldn't hew to the\ntechnicality of the statute of limitation, the State\nought to be able to waive it.\nMR. KISE: And I think that's why it is set\nup the way it is, Your Honor, but it's just that the\nwaiver is not the beginning and end of it. For\nexample, where the State might wish to waive the\nstatute of limitations and simply move to the merits\nwould be in a situation where there might be some\ncomplex argument over equitable tolling and where the\nmerits are relatively straightforward. Rather than\nspending the court's time and the resources involved\nand litigating over equitable tolling, the State might\nsimply say, \"We realize that there is this\ntechnicality here, but we're going to get to the\nmerits, because otherwise we're going to spend an\ninordinate amount of time litigating.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's always a\ntechnicality. What you're saying is, the only time\nthat the State can do that is when the answer to the\nstatute of limitations is unclear. And I'm saying\nsometimes the State may say, \"The answer is clear, but\ndoggone it, this is just too picky-picky, too\ntechnical in this particular case.\"\nMR. KISE: And, Your Honor, our test allows\nfor that, as well. It's up to the District Court to\ndecide whether, in that particular case, the\ncircumstances require the application. There is some\ndiscretion. I don't think that the State could --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would it -- would it\nalways be an abuse of discretion for the District\nCourt to do this if the State wanted to reach the\nmerits?\nMR. KISE: I don't think so, Your Honor,\nbecause it would depend on why the State wanted to\nreach the merits. Perhaps the State was engaging in\nsome sort of gaming of the system, as Petitioner\nalleges could happen. If there was, in fact, some\nactual sandbagging going on, where the State is\nholding this issue in reserve as a strategic matter,\nand the District Court simply says, \"No, we're not\ngoing to allow that.\" And it would really be the same\nanalysis under Rule 15. If the court were to have\nsandbagged, so to speak, under Rule 15 and waited to\nfile a late amendment, the court would engage in the\nsame analysis. The court would say, \"Well, wait, do I\nreally want to permit the State, now, to assert this?\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no question\nof -- put aside a sandbagging case, there's no\nquestion of sandbagging, and that the -- the State\njust wants to litigate on the merits rather than on\nthe statute of limitations.\nMR. KISE: It would not always be an abuse\nof discretion. I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, can\nthey have it -- would it be an abuse of discretion in\nan express waiver case as opposed to a forfeiture\ncase?\nMR. KISE: I don't think that you could say,\nin all circumstances -- no, Your Honor, it would not\nbe an abuse of discretion in all circumstances. But I\ndo think the District Court needs to factor in the\ninterests of the State and the reasons why the State\nis willing to proceed forward. And if the State, for\nexample, is, as I believe an example was given by the\ncourt, that the State is -- believes that, \"Well,\nperhaps it's appropriate to waive the statute here, or\nto not rely on the statute here, because of something\nmaybe we have done, or that it -- the Petitioner\ndidn't -- missed the deadline by a certain period of\ntime, and we think that, in this particular case, it's\nall right to reach those merits.\"\nSo, I can't -- I don't think we should say\nthat it's always an abuse of discretion, but I think\nwe need to leave it to District Courts to make that\ndetermination, just as this Court did in Granberry and\nCaspari. This Court gave District Courts that\ndiscretion, because these are the types of cases where\nthat discretion is appropriate. This Court's already\nidentified that, in habeas cases, we are to treat\nRules 8 and 12 as the exception being applied, that\nthese --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought in Granberry\nthe Court gave the Court of Appeals that discretion,\nsince it hadn't -- the point had been missed in the\nDistrict Court, been missed by everybody, until the\nCourt of Appeals.\nMR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, in fact, this\nCourt did give the Court of Appeals that discretion,\nbut even more so than we would give the District Court\nthat discretion, because, Why should we wait for the\nprocess to get all the way to the Court of Appeals?\nIf this Court is going to say it's appropriate for the\nCourt of Appeals to look at an affirmative defense,\nthen certainly, in keeping with that reasoning, it\nwould be appropriate for a District Court to raise it\nbefore we've gone through the entire process of\nlitigation in the District Court and then getting\nourselves to the Court of Appeals.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You acknowledge at least\nthis much, or am I incorrect? And it's important for\nme to know that. You acknowledge at least this much,\nthat if we read this opinion, as you do not, to be\nsaying that the court \"must\" do this so that the court\nwas not really considering all factors in the exercise\nof its discretion, we would have to remand.\nMR. KISE: No, Your Honor, I would not, and\nI'll tell you why I would not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right.\nMR. KISE: It's because, just as in\nGonzalez, the Court is not reviewing the opinion. The\nCourt is reviewing the judgment. And the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why would --\nMR. KISE: -- judgment is correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- why would you deal\nwith that hypothetical when the Eleventh Circuit, in\nall fairness, said, \"We join the Second, Fourth,\nFifth, and Ninth Circuit, and rule that, even though\nthe statute of limitations is an affirmative defense,\nthe District Court may review the timeliness of the\n2254.\" That's what -- the question that the court\nthought it was deciding.\nMR. KISE: I would agree that the court\nthought it was deciding discretion, but I was\nresponding, I -- to what I thought was Justice\nScalia's question about, What if this Court does not\nagree with that? If this Court believes that the\nEleventh Circuit, in fact, was applying an obligation\nrule, a mandatory rule, then it would require remand.\nAnd I -- what I'm saying, Your Honor, is -- is that\nwe would not, because the District Court applied the\nappropriate test. In the first instance, I would say\nthat the Eleventh Circuit did not, in fact, apply that\ntest, did not believe that it was obligated to, but if\nthis Court were to disagree, as Justice Scalia has\npresented the hypothetical, then I would say that the\nDistrict Court did, in fact, apply the correct test.\nThe District Court, as noted in -- on page 8(a) of the\npetition appendix, the footnote in the magistrate's\nreport and recommendation cites Jackson, the Eleventh\nCircuit case which stands for the discretionary\nproposition, and indicates specifically that it is\nrelying on a discretionary test. And so, the District\nCourt in this case, in fact, applied the test that we\nare advocating, and in -- and, frankly, got it right.\nThe District Court applied discretion, raised the\nissue, provided a notice and an opportunity to be\nheard, conducted the analysis of prejudice -- there\nwas no prejudice in this case -- and ruled, on that\nbasis. And that ruling was consistent with this\nCourt's habeas jurisprudence, and it was consistent\nwith AEDPA and with the habeas rules.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why doesn't your\nposition on the underlying merits of the timeliness\nquestion create an incentive for every habeas\npetitioner to file a cert petition?\nMR. KISE: I'm not sure I follow your --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you --\nMR. KISE: -- your question, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you only get the\nextra 90 days if you actually file, under your\nexplanation for why this cert petition is -- why this\nhabeas petition is untimely. In other words, if this\nindividual had filed a cert petition with us, his\npetition -- his habeas petition would be timely. And\nhe's only going to get the extra period, as I\nunderstand your position on the timeliness, if he\nfiles a cert petition.\nMR. KISE: I understand our position to be\nthat they do not get the 90 days, postconviction. And\nif that is misstated in our brief -- but I --\ncertainly we're not attempting to encourage the filing\nof cert petitions by habeas petitioners. And we\nbelieve the statute provides for the 90 days,\npostdirect review, but not after following State\npostconviction. Once the State postconviction\nproceedings are no longer pending, meaning that they\nare completed for State purposes, not including the 90\ndays --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. KISE: -- that's when they terminate.\nThat is our position.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if they file a\ncert petition.\nMR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, doesn't that put\nthem in the position of sometimes having to file that\n-- the habeas petition while the cert petition is\nstill pending, if they file one?\nMR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor, it might. It\ndoes present that conundrum. But that's what the\nstatute provides. That is the way the statute has\nprovided for it. And we think that interpretation is\nconsistent, because there certainly -- as was\nreferenced in the first oral argument, there is some\nexpectation that the court might grant certiorari, but\nit's not in the -- the likely case. And so, to\nsuspend the congressional purpose of moving these\ncases through the system on the chance that the one in\na thousand, or perhaps more than one in a thousand,\ncase is granted certiorari would not be an appropriate\nprocess to utilize. And I think the Circuit Courts\nbear that out. The opinions of all but one of the\nCircuits bear that -- bear that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there a conflict on the\nCircuits on that point? I don't know.\nMR. KISE: Your Honor, one Circuit -- ten of\nthe Circuits go in the direction that we advocate, and\nAbela, the Sixth Circuit case that is cited, I\nbelieve, by the Petitioner --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. KISE: -- moves in the other direction.\nAnd it is only recently that they have done that.\nIf the Court has no further questions, thank\nyou.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Hallward-Driemeier, we'll hear now from\nyou.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nIN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENT\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThere is nothing in either the habeas rules\nor the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that deprives\nthe District Court of its authority sua sponte to\nrecognize the untimeliness of a habeas petition. To\nthe contrary, to the extent the rules speak to the\nissue at all, they confirm that in light of the\nsignificant social cost of Federal review of State\nCourt convictions, the Federal Courts have a unique\nresponsibility to weed out unmeritorious claims and to\nenforce the limitations on habeas review.\nRule 4 imposes an obligation on the court to\ndismiss unmeritorious petitions without even calling\nfor an answer by the State. Now, Rule 4 is not\napplicable here, but the absence of an obligation to\nnote the deficiency sua sponte does not connote a\nprohibition on acting sua sponte; rather, it suggests\nthat it lies in the court's discretion. That is\nexactly how this Court addressed similar question in\nGranberry, where it rejected the two extremes -- one,\nrecognizing the limitation as jurisdictional, that the\ncourt was obligated to raise it sua sponte, but also\nrejecting the opposite extreme, that the court was\nprohibited to address an issue that had not been\npreserved in the District Court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why, though, would we have\na special rule in this respect for habeas cases? Same\nquestion I've had throughout. Treat it like any other\ncivil case.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It's not really a\nspecial rule that we're advocating.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, if it's not a\nspecial rule, then the answer to this is, just say,\n\"No, you don't have to raise it sua sponte. Moreover,\nyou cannot raise it sua sponte, except in exceptional\ncircumstances,\" cite the three cases that said that.\nAnd, as far as you're suggesting it to people, you\ncould do it just as much as you do in any other civil\ncase, no special rule. If they want to move to amend,\nfine, end of case, we did it in a paragraph.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The relevant\nanalogy in the civil context is not to what a court\nwould do with a statute of limitations defense in the\ncivil context, it is to what would the court do with\nrespect to an affirmative defense that, like the\nhabeas limitations, implicates broader social\ninterests?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the same with strike\nsuits. You know, there are a lot of class-action\nstrike suits and so forth that at least one group of\npeople think are terrible and the other group think\nare great. So, you say, \"Well, we're going to have a\nspecial thing here for amendments in strike suits.\nHave a special amendment for some\" -- you know, why\nproliferate law?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the Court\nrecognized -- Arizona v. California is an example of\nthe broader social interests that are implicated by\nthe affirmative defense of res judicata. And the\nCourt noted, in Arizona versus California, that it\nwould be appropriate for the court to raise that\ndefense sua sponte. And, of course, Plaut versus\nSpendthrift Farm says the same thing.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not generally. Statute\nof limitations, like res judicata, they are 8(c)\naffirmative defenses, and preclusion doctrine is for\nthe party to waive or not, just like the statute of\nlimitations. I don't think there's any rule that says\na judge in the run-of-the-mine case acts properly by\ninterjecting preclusion into a case where no party has\nraised it.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, our point is\nthat it is a matter for the court's discretion. And\nthere may well be circumstances where it would be an\nabuse of discretion to interject a timeliness\nobjection. For example, if the case had gone on for\nyears, and a trial had been held, as Your Honor\nsuggested in the question earlier, that might well be\nan abuse of discretion, but it would not -- for\nexample, take the case where the District Court had\ndismissed, at the outset, on the merits, and it went\nup to the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals\nsaid, \"You know, that merits issue is a very difficult\none. And, in fact, we think we might have to remand\nfor an evidentiary hearing on that issue. But, you\nknow, this case was untimely filed. We can dispose of\nit on that basis. And we can save all of those\njudicial and party resources by addressing that issue\nnow.\" We think that would be an appropriate exercise\nof the court's discretion.\nHere, as Your Honor noted earlier, this was\nthe first thing that happened in the District Court\nafter the filing of the petition, the answer, and the\nreply. There was no waste of judicial resources by\nthe fact that it was raised sua sponte by the court in\nthe first thing that the court did after that\nbriefing. There was no prejudice to the Petitioner,\nbecause it was omitted from the State's responsive\npleading. There is -- as the Court said in Granberry,\nthe failure to plead it perhaps waives the District --\nthe State's opportunity to insist on the defense. The\nState, because it said, in its answer here,\nerroneously, that the petition was timely filed, or if\nit had said nothing, would have waived its opportunity\nto stand on, and insist on, that defense. But it is\nnot an absolute forfeiture. It does not bar the party\nfrom suggesting at a later time, \"We would like to\namend,\" or, in this case, the court to note it sua\nsponte.\nThe court did, here, of course, give the\nPetitioner every opportunity --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. From what you\njust said, I take it that means that even when the\nState is unwilling to change its mind and says, \"No,\nwe would still prefer not to assert the defense,\" you\nwould allow the court to impose it.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: We believe that the\ncourt is not absolutely limited by the defenses --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The answer --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- asserted by --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- is yes.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes. Yes. The\ncourt is not absolutely limited by the affirmative\ndefenses asserted by the State. For -- and that is\nperhaps most easily seen with respect to affirmative\ndefenses such as failure to exhaust, nonretroactivity.\nIf the court was going to have to assess a brand-new\nconstitutional claim that the habeas petitioner --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But with respect to\nsome --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- was asserting --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- of those, of\ncourse, AEDPA specifically promulgates new rules about\nwhen they're waived, and not. And they -- Congress\nhasn't done that with respect to the statute of\nlimitations.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. And\nobviously, as the State suggested, if the State didn't\nwant to stand on the statute of limitations defense\nbecause, for example, it was particularly messy, there\nwas going to be a lot of litigation about equitable\ntolling, it would in inappropriate for the court to\ninsist on litigating that issue. But if, for example,\nthe State said, \"Well, you know, if we didn't stand on\nthis defense, instead this Petitioner would go back to\nthe State Court, and the State's Courts are going to\nbe very hospitable to this claim. We think you're\nmore likely to deny relief, so we'd rather have it\nlitigated here,\" it would inappropriate for the State\nto try to force the Federal Court to litigate that\nissue instead of the State Court. These are all fact-\nspecific, case-specific considerations. And that's\nwhat the Court did in Granberry. It remanded --\nafter setting aside both extreme positions, it\nremanded to the Court of Appeals for a case-specific\napplication of discretion.\nAs to the question of whether the Eleventh\nCircuit here believed that there was an absolute\nobligation, I think that it's relevant to note that,\nalthough there was one point at which it said, \"The\ncourt was obligated to enforce the statute of\nlimitations\" -- and, of course, that's true if the\nState has preserved the defense -- there were three\nother points in the Court of Appeals opinion where it\nused discretionary or nonmandatory language. For\nexample, at petition appendix 4(a), the court said\nthat the District Court \"may dismiss.\" At the\npetition appendix 5(a), it said that the State's\nfailure to raise \"does not bar\" the court from acting\nsua sponte. Again, at petition appendix 6(a), the\nState's concession, quote, \"does not compromise the\nauthority of the District Court.\" All of those are\nphrased in more permissive language --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But, of course,\n\"may\" is -- \"may\" is embraced within \"must.\" If you\n\"must,\" you \"may.\"\n[Laughter.]\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, perhaps the -\n- perhaps the even most clear indication of what the\nCourt of Appeals viewed this is its citation to\nJackson as an application of Jackson. And in Jackson\nthere is no question, because Jackson said, quote,\n\"The District Court possessed the discretion to raise\nsua sponte.\" And the -- and the magistrate judge, as\nthe State's counsel, mentioned -- in footnote 1 of its\nopinion, cites that same standard and makes clear that\nit's raising this at a -- as a matter of its\ndiscretion. So, remand for the exercise of discretion\nwould be -- serve no purpose in this case.\nIf there are no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Busby, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. BRETT BUSBY\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. BUSBY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI'd like to begin by addressing the \"must\"\nversus \"may\" issue that Counsel discussed. For the\nreasons I mentioned, I think the better reading of the\nEleventh Circuit's opinion is that there was an\nobligation, and that the most clear indication of that\nis its distinction of Esslinger, which expressly\napplied a Granberry-type analysis. But, even if the\nCourt believes that the Eleventh Circuit was only\nsaying \"may,\" and that the District Court was only\nsaying \"may,\" and recognized the that it had\ndiscretion -- and there is a footnote in the\nmagistrate's opinion that cites to Jackson that says,\n\"We have discretion\" -- I would submit that if you\nread Jackson, it's a standardless discretion. There\nare no factors anywhere in Jackson of the type that\nthis Court discussed in Granberry. It -- and there's\nno indication that the -- that the magistrate judge\nconsidered any of those factors. There's no\nindication that the Eleventh Circuit considered any of\nthose factors. And it's certainly an abuse of\ndiscretion for a court to apply the wrong legal\nstandard or fail to consider the relevant factors that\nchannel that discretion.\nAnd so, we -- our position is that, because\nthe factors under Rule 15 and the other factors in our\nbrief were not applied, that a remand, at a minimum,\nis appropriate in this case.\nAlso, I'd like to speak to Granberry and\nCaspari. Again, those involve exhaustion and\nnonretroactivity. And I submit that it's not correct\nto characterize those two doctrines as affirmative\ndefenses; rather, the way that Congress codified them\nis on -- as substantive limits on relief, unlike\n\"limitations,\" which it just said \"period of\nlimitations,\" which the commonly accepted meaning is\nan \"affirmative defense.\" And so, that makes those\nvery different from an affirmative defense, in terms\nof sua sponte consideration.\nAlso, both \"exhaustion\" and\n\"nonretroactivity\" are unique to habeas. They're not\nmentioned anywhere in Rules 8 and 12. Whereas,\n\"limitations,\" of course, is mentioned explicitly.\nAnd so, our position is that Rule 8 and 12, not\nnecessarily always, but at least in all but\nextraordinary cases, would prevent the judge from\nraising this sua sponte.\nAlso, I would say that the rules that we\nrely on don't deprive the court of sua sponte\nauthority, they channel that authority. Under Rule 4,\nthey can plead it, or the court can make a motion to\ndismiss -- ask the -- order the State to make a motion\nto dismiss based on limitations under Habeas Rule 4.\nThey can plead it in their answer, under Habeas Rule 5\nand Civil Rules 8 and 12, or they can amend their\nanswer, under Civil Rule 15. That's the way the\ndrafters of the rules wanted them to do this. And\nLonchar and Carlisle say they cannot -- that a judge\ncannot use his sua sponte power to circumvent the\nrequirements of those rules.\nFinally, I'd like to mention that civil --\nthe statutes of limitations in civil cases also\nimplicate broader social interests. And some of them,\nwe've discussed in our brief. And, even more so,\nbecause there are lots of protections in AEDPA cases\nthat don't apply in civil cases. There are\npresumptions of correctness and those sorts of things.\nBut courts in civil cases, nonetheless, say that\nstatutes of limitations can be waived. And the result\nshould be no different here.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
