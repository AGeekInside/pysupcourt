        "content": "(10:23 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nthis morning in Case 06-1431, CBOCS West v. Humphries.\nMr. Hawkins.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. HAWKINS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HAWKINS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nBased on the plain terms of section 1981,\nthis Court's interpretation of that statute under\nRunyon, Patterson, and Domino's Pizza, as well as\nCongress' recognition of the distinction between\ndiscrimination and retaliation and this Court's decision\nin Burlington Northern, section 1981 does not contain a\nseparate cause of action for retaliation.\nThe Court starts with a review of the text\nof the statute. Section 1981(a) says that all persons\nshall have the right, the same right as is enjoyed by\nwhite citizens to make and enforce contracts. Words\nlike \"the same,\" \"equal,\" and \"like\" are all in 1981(a),\nand those words all have normal, plain, ordinary\nmeaning, that is identical. So what section 1981 says\nis in the making and enforcing of contracts all persons\nshall have identical rights as white citizens.\nAs we move into this issue --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you see any meaningful\ndifference between the language of 1981 and 1982 in this\nregard?\nMR. HAWKINS: Justice Alito, I do, and in\nthat context section 1981 was amended in 1991, and with\na lot of this Court's precedent in terms of how statutes\nare viewed, they all have a life. This section 1981 has\na new life when it was amended in 1981.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that it was\nnarrowed in 1981?\nMR. HAWKINS: I think with respect to this\nissue, Your Honor, of retaliation, that it was. And I\nsay it because of this. In 1991, Congress passed the\n1991 Civil Rights Act and in that act they also included\nretaliation for 2 U.S.C. 1212. So Congress was\nconsciously thinking about this issue of retaliation.\nThey had Patterson that had come before it, they had\nWest Virginia Hospital that had come before it, saying\nyou have to have specific terms, you have to deal with\nspecific issues.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, wasn't the purpose of\nthe 1991 act to broaden the scope of 1981 rather than\nnarrow it?\nMR. HAWKINS: Your Honor, with respect to\nthe '91 act, it was supposed to specifically pick up the\npost-formation contract issues under Patterson.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is to say it was\ndesigned to overrule Patterson.\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not overrule. They can't\noverrule it, but change the law --\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, it didn't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- so that Patterson would\nno longer be right.\nMR. HAWKINS: It didn't change Patterson. I\nbelieve as Chief Judge Easterbrook said, Patterson has\nbeen cited some 27 times by this Court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: \"EES-ter-brook.\"\nMR. HAWKINS: Or \"EAS-ter-brook.\" I'm\nsorry. Thank you, Your Honor.\nBy this Court, and in that context it is\nstill good law. What it did was to clarify the issue of\npost-formation contracts.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you mean Patterson\nwould come out the same under 1981 as amended by the\n1991 act.\nMR. HAWKINS: Yes. I think Patterson would\ncome out the same, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think Congress would\nhave been quite amazed at that rule.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think that they would be\nastounded.\nMR. HAWKINS: No. In the context of the new\npost-formation -- excuse me. I understood your question\na little differently, Your Honor. Yes, it would come\nout differently if you were dealing with the precise\nissue in Patterson.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying that\nbefore the 1991 amendment retaliation was included?\nMR. HAWKINS: No. I would say, Justice\nGinsburg, that before the 1991 amendment retaliation\nwasn't included and it wasn't included after the 1991\namendment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What change did the 1991\namendment make then?\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, it wasn't included --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say it was intended to\nchange the outcome of Patterson. In what respect? You\nsay not in the respect of whether retaliation is\nincluded but in what respect then?\nMR. HAWKINS: In respect to the\npost-formation. Patterson was dealing with those\naspects of just the initial making and enforcing of a\ncontract, not once you've got the contract established\nand in this case employment, what happens, promotions,\ndemotions, actions of that nature, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand you.\nPatterson said that post-formation actions were not\ncovered, right?\nMR. HAWKINS: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Retaliation is one, but\njust one of many post-formation actions, right?\nMR. HAWKINS: Well Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What other post-formation\nactions were there that --\nMR. HAWKINS: What other post-formation --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was the post-formation\naction that was in action in Patterson?\nMR. HAWKINS: Patterson was dealing with the\nissue about after you had the relationship could an\nemployer take an adverse discriminatory action against\nthe individual, and the Court said no. It was dealing\nwith a harassment situation. Afterwards you could not\nhave a cause of action in the post-formation situation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And Congress changed that\nand the case we have is also post-formation.\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, but Congress changed it\nto say that it would include, in subsection 1981(b),\nthat it would include certain specified post-formation\nconduct with respect to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It didn't specify them. I\nthink your point is probably that it includes the same\npost-formation conduct that is prohibited at formation,\nwhich is to say discrimination on the basis of race,\nwhich is not retaliation; right?\nMR. HAWKINS: It did not change that, that's\ncorrect, Your Honor. It did not add retaliation.\nAnd so what has taken place with respect to this issue\nof discrimination and retaliation and the reason that we\nsay that it does not exist in section 1981 is Congress\nin some 30 statutes we've been able to run across has\nspecifically included retaliation in provisions where\nthey so applauded appropriate --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under your view, would\nharassment be prohibited by 1981 as amended?\nMR. HAWKINS: If it is racial harassment,\nmeaning the treating of someone differently than a white\ncitizen because of their race, then it would be. That's\nthe status issue and that's what was addressed in\nBurlington Northern in terms of the distinction that\nexists between discrimination and retaliation, one being\nbased on the individual status, which is really what\nsection 1981 is focused on.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the term \"harassment\"\nis not included in 1981(b).\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, if it's just harassment,\nJustice Kennedy, in the abstract -- I'm harassing\nsomebody because I don't like them -- whether they're\nblack or white, that wouldn't be actionable under\nsection 1981. You have to have a focus of \"I'm taking\nthis action against the individual because of the color\nof their skin, because of their race.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't that true here?\nBecause we're not talking about retaliation in a vacuum;\nwe're talking about retaliation for complaining about\nrace discrimination.\nMR. HAWKINS: Your Honor, if you have a\nsituation where -- and I think it's even addressed in\nsome of the Respondent's brief. And many of the cases\ngoing back in the '70s and '80s that were even cited by\nthe Seventh Circuit, all deal with situations even where\nthey were, if you want to call them retaliation, they\nwere retaliation based on directly the person's color of\ntheir skin. They were this particular supervisor or\nthis employer is taking this or that action against\nsomebody because they're a black person. They're not\ntaking --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What kind of -- what kind\nof right to be free from discrimination would there be\nif once one complains one can be fired, demoted? That\nwould not be a very effective right, would it be?\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, Your Honor, I mean there\nare alternatives for that particular issue. In this\nparticular case, there was Title VII that fully\nprotected the Respondent from any form of discrimination\nor retaliation. In addition, in the State of Illinois\nthere are state statutes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But one can say the same\nthing for Title VII and, say, the Equal Pay Act. There\nare a lot of overlapping antidiscrimination laws. That\ndoesn't mean that we shrink one because another exists.\nMR. HAWKINS: No, but there is precedent for\nthe fact that where one law does cover a particular\nsituation, we don't go about removing that impact. So\nTitle VII clearly does cover this particular situation\nof a retaliation, a pure retaliation claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why did they -- why did\nthey proceed under Title VII then? What -- what help --\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, they did proceed under\nTitle VII, and that was dismissed by the Federal court\nbecause he did not pay his proper filing fee on time in\ncompliance with Title VII requirements.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's -- that's\noften the case, isn't it? I mean, the argument you just\nmade could go as well to somebody who uses 1981 to\ncomplain about a racially-based demotion wasn't able to\nuse Title VII because he filed too late. That's a\ntypical use of 1981; is it not?\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, it can be a use, yes,\nYour Honor, that people do use it for that very purpose.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So what is the difference\nbetween this case -- you say, well, there's Title VII\nand this would erode Title VII. Doesn't it erode Title\nVII when I'm complaining about, say, a demotion?\nMR. HAWKINS: No, because they can coexist\nwith respect to those particular issues, and this Court\nhas recognized that those two statutes can coexist.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does -- does the person who\nis retaliated against, that is the person who complained\nand is retaliated against, have to be the person who was\ndiscriminated against?\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, Your Honor, based on a\nreading of Domino's, it would certainly appear that the\nindividual who is making the complaint to have\nprotection must be the individual who has the\ncontractual right, as opposed to complaining about a\nthird person.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, is your\nposition that in that situation a retaliation is not\ncovered by 1981?\nMR. HAWKINS: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought\nthat you could argue that it's direct discrimination.\nIn other words, if you're fired, whatever form the\nretaliation takes, that, as Justice Ginsburg suggests,\nthat that would be on the basis -- basis of race. And I\nthought your position, or at least your position could\nbe narrowed to say it's only when the individual against\nwhom the retaliation takes place is not the individual\ncomplaining of the direct discrimination that your\nposition would be pertinent.\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, Your Honor, we take the\nposition that in order to have a retaliation claim under\nsection 1981, it really has to be a discrimination\nclaim. You have to be able to show that you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's right.\nThat's why I thought the person directly discriminated\nagainst would be able to phrase the retaliation claim\ncertainly as a discrimination claim.\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, Your Honor, they can\nmake -- phrase it however they want to in terms of their\nparticular complaint, but the issue in terms of the\nanalysis under the plain text of section 1981 is whether\nor not a white person in this situation is being treated\ndifferently with respect to making a similar complaint.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Surely -- surely, you don't\nmean what you just said a minute ago, that in order to\nhave a retaliation claim you must have a discrimination\nclaim.\nMR. HAWKINS: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Surely it's your position\nthat even when you have a discrimination claim, you\ndon't have a retaliation claim. I thought it was your\nposition there are no retaliation claims under this\nstatute.\nMR. HAWKINS: There is no retaliation claim\nin the abstract under this statute, period, correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You practice in this --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you say --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in this area --\nMR. HAWKINS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Perhaps you can maybe just\ntell me based on your experience: After 1981 was\namended, did 1981(b) supersede Title VII in\nrun-of-the-mill termination and harassment cases?\nMR. HAWKINS: No, Your Honor. In my 32\nyears of experience of doing labor and employment law,\nand particularly in employment law, individuals are not\ntypically bringing 1981 retaliation claims, where most\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, not retaliation.\nI mean harassment, discharge, et cetera.\nMR. HAWKINS: Did we see a big spurt in\nthose?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. HAWKINS: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why not? There's a longer\nstatute of limitation. There's no cap on damages.\nMR. HAWKINS: From our experience, more and\nmore people -- there's been a trend to go to State court\nbecause more and more States --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then I have to\nrefine the hypothetical. I don't want to take too much,\nbut in Federal court --\nMR. HAWKINS: In Federal --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- because it does seem to\nme that Congress told us: We don't care if there's an\noverlap between 1981 and Title VII, we don't care if\nthere's a longer statute of limitations, we don't care\nif there's no cap an damages; we want 1981 to work. And\nthat's -- 1981 does apply in a large number of\nemployment discrimination cases.\nMR. HAWKINS: In the Federal system.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if that's true, then\nwhy do we worry about retaliation? If Congress is not\nconcerned about it, why should we be?\nMR. HAWKINS: Your Honor, in answer to your\nquestion, yes, we've seen more adding on section 1981\nclaims with Title VII claims in Federal court. So the\nanswer to that question is yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Of course, it's just for\nrace claims, and Title VII covers sex, national origin.\nMR. HAWKINS: Title VII covers race and\nretaliation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: My point is that 1981\nwould not be available to other categories. It's only\nrace, right?\nMR. HAWKINS: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Any other advantages to\n1981? You get attorney's fees in 1981?\nMR. HAWKINS: Longer statute of limitations,\nsimilar attorney's fees, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you get that under\nTitle VII?\nMR. HAWKINS: Yes, you do, but it's a longer\nstatute of limitations, and it's uncapped damages\nbecause of the caps under Title VII that exists.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What happens in just a\nbasic employment case? I'm trying to remember from law\nschool. Somebody's contract with another man, he's the\nemployee, and he says -- the employer says: I'm firing\nyou because you won't help me rob the bank. Or the\nemployee goes and he finds some money in a wallet or\nsomething on the street, and he says, I'm going to\nreturn it to the rightful owner, and the employer says,\nI hate rightful owners, so I'm firing you. Now, when\nthe employee goes to court, I take it -- my vague\nrecollection is the employer can't do that.\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, it's going to depend\nupon the State and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The State law, is there\nsome kind of policy against that from the State law, he\ncouldn't do it?\nMR. HAWKINS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, here we have a\nFederal statute that says that a black person shall have\nthe same right to make a contract as a white person.\nBut if nobody ever can report on that, that they're not,\nit's not going to be the same right; it's going to be\nzero right. So, why by parity of reasoning wouldn't\nthis provide for the same kind of thing?\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, Justice Breyer, if white\nindividuals are also terminated for making complaints --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no. It would make no\ndifference whether you're a thief in my example, whether\nyou're good-hearted. It doesn't matter who you are.\nYou could even be somebody from another country. You\ndon't have to be American. You could be anything. But\nthe State law tries to follow out that -- that policy of\nnot having bank robberies and of returning money to\nrightful owners.\nWell, here we have a Federal policy, and the\nFederal policy is that black people shall be treated the\nsame as white in respect to making a contract. But were\nthe law to allow you to fire anybody who complained\nabout it, then black people wouldn't have that right.\nAnd therefore the policy is that you can't do it under\nthis statute because otherwise the written policy is\nineffective.\nI'm just remembering that from my written --\nfrom my policy arguments that were in contract law.\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, Your Honor, I would go\nback to the plain, clear terms with their ordinary\nmeaning, and it says equal rights as white citizens and\nit talks about the same and that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does it say anywhere, by\nthe way, in that statute that a black person who is\ndiscriminated against can go to court and file a\nlawsuit?\nMR. HAWKINS: If they have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does it say that?\nMR. HAWKINS: If they are not being treated\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Does it say is in\nthat statute, 1981?\nMR. HAWKINS: Does it have the words \"you\nmay go into court for lawsuit\"?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, correct.\nMR. HAWKINS: No, it does not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there a Federal common\nlaw? Are we sitting here trying to write a Federal\ncommon law?\nMR. HAWKINS: No, we're here dealing dealing\nwith Federal statutes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So State courts can do\nthat. They can make it up; can't they?\nMR. HAWKINS: State courts develop public\npolicy. They do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And have we developed a\npolicy here in creating a right of action under this\n1981?\nMR. HAWKINS: Rights of action have existed\nunder Federal statute, that's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which is the statute that\ndoes -- is there a statute that specifically gives you a\nright to sue under 1981? Is there a statute?\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, this Court has\nestablished that, particularly with respect to section\n1981, that an individual does have a right of action.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It has established it.\nYes, that's my point: That the Federal court implied\nfrom the statute a right of action.\nNow, if they're implying a right of action\nfrom the statute, why wouldn't courts also imply those\nrights of action necessary to make the statute\neffective?\nMR. HAWKINS: Because this Court in a\nvariety of cases such as Russello, West Virginia,\nUniversity Hospital, Arlington Public School, has said\nthat we look at the text and we examine the text of the\nstatute, and unless it is ambiguous -- and I would\ncertainly submit that words like \"same,\" \"like,\" \"equal\"\nare not ambiguous terms -- that we leave it alone; that\nthat's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That isn't the word I was\nlooking for. The word I was looking for in 1981(a) is\nthe word \"and can bring a lawsuit in Federal court.\" I\ndon't see that written there.\nMR. HAWKINS: It's not in there, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, correct. So we've\nimplied that. And therefore, if I can imply that, why\ncan't we imply a lawsuit on behalf of those who need the\nlawsuit to make the right effective?\nMR. HAWKINS: Because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That was my basic question.\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, in response to it, I\nwould simply say that you have to look to the text as to\nhow you're trying to apply it, and what you're applying\nit to, and this particular statute protects against\ndifferent treatment, not specifically with respect to\nsome other --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hawkins, don't we have\na whole line of recent cases which say we have set our\nface against implying causes of action?\nMR. HAWKINS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A whole bunch of recent\ncases saying we're not going to do that any more.\nMR. HAWKINS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We used to do it, but we\nsaid we're not going to do it any more.\nMR. HAWKINS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So why don't you invoke\nthose?\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, I -- we -- we do invoke\nthose in our brief, and those are all part of what I'm\ngetting at in terms of -- I mean Arlington School Board\nwas one of those cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We do have those\nrecent cases, but we also have the Sullivan case\ninterpreting -- interpreting 1982, which arose under the\nprior approach to these questions. And my question for\nyou is: Under principles of stare decisis, which body\ndo we follow, the earlier case interpreting 1982 under\nthe more freewheeling approach to statutory\ninterpretation or this later body of law that says we're\nnot going to do that any more?\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, Mr. Chief Justice,\nparticularly since this Court has Runyon, Patterson, and\nDomino's interpreting Section 1981, that's what to look\nat to interpret section 1981, not Sullivan, which\ninterprets a different statute. They all --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's a statute that\nhas the same derivation. They're both from the 1866\nCivil Rights Act, and they're both set up the same way.\n1982 also says \"same\" as 1981 does. So wouldn't it be\nodd to take these twin measures and say one includes\nretaliation and the other doesn't?\nWouldn't Congress, when it revised 1981 in\n1991 been aware of Sullivan and expect this Court to\ninterpret those twin statutes the same way?\nMR. HAWKINS: Justice Ginsburg, with all due\nrespect, I would think not; and the reason is this\nCourt, when it acted in 1991, had in front of it to look\nat Patterson, which was saying, we're going to interpret\nSection 1981 in a straightforward, plain-text situation.\nIn fact, Patterson says in it if the right is not\nspecifically set forth in section 1981, there is no\nrelief.\nThen after that, you had West Virginia,\nwhich was decided in March of 1991, again taking that\nsame sort of approach with respect to if it's not in the\nstatute, we're not going to make it. It may be that\nit's a job left for Congress. So they act on those and\npass the law in November of '91.\nThat's the context. And even in the Jackson\ncase, in looking back, Justice O'Connor ended up saying\nthat what we are looking back at is 1972 following 1969.\nSo in 1991 we're looking at Section 1981 being amended,\nand we're looking at Patterson and West Virginia to give\nthe context.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't you look at what\nCongress was trying to do in the 1991 amendments? That\nis, Congress changed the law that this Court had\ndeclared; and the message, the essential message, was\nthis Court has been too stingy in its interpretation of\nTitle -- of 1981, so we're going to change it.\nMR. HAWKINS: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it seems to me that\nwe wouldn't be hearing -- we wouldn't be grasping that\nmessage.\nMR. HAWKINS: But, Your Honor, in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you agree with that?\nI don't understand why you agree with that.\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, I think that there was\nsome perspective. I don't personally agree with it, But\nI think there was some --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then don't say \"yes.\" I\nmean, it may well be that Congress thought our\ninterpretation of 1981 was perfectly reasonable, or it\nhad no idea what our interpretation of 1981 was. But\nthey know what they wanted to do in -- in 1991. Okay?\nMR. HAWKINS: I agree, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's all we know for\nsure.\nMR. HAWKINS: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That Congress wanted that\ndisposition. They weren't necessarily disapproving our\nprior decision. Is there anything in the statute which\nsaid the Supreme Court made a bad decision, and we're\ngoing to fix it?\nMR. HAWKINS: No. There's nothing in that\nat all.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There is something to\nthat effect in the legislative history that explains why\nCongress made the amendments it did in 1991.\nMR. HAWKINS: And we could have a whole\ndebate about the legislative history and what --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not? Because the\nlegislative history does say, when they passed this,\nthat the new law will involve a claim, allow them to\nmake a claim of harassment, discharge, promotion,\ntransfer, retaliation, and hiring.\nMR. HAWKINS: Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So when they write that in\nthe House report, isn't that some evidence that they did\nlook back and see Sullivan, and they did think that in\n1982 there's a retaliation action, and therefore in 1981\nthere is one? Isn't there at least evidence that there\nwere people in Congress thinking that?\nMR. HAWKINS: Yes, that's evidence that\nsomebody in Congress was thinking that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that someone --\nMR. HAWKINS: But I think if we just use an\nanalogy with contract law, if we're negotiating a\ncontract --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did the committee vote on\nthat committee report?\nMR. HAWKINS: No, they did not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So how do you know if\nanybody in Congress thought that?\nMR. HAWKINS: Well, somebody wrote it in a\nreport.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It could have been a\nteenager who wrote the report.\nMR. HAWKINS: It doesn't have any\nsignificance with respect to this legislation. What I'm\nsaying is I think it works against -- that argument\nworks against what ended up being in the statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I think we're\nfamiliar with that debate. But if we can look -- look\nat the statute, if I ask you why isn't this an enjoyment\nof a benefit, a privilege or term or a condition of the\ncontract, is your answer that this was an at-will\ncontract?\nMR. HAWKINS: I think the Seventh Circuit is\nsaying we're not making the at-will argument in this\ncase, and that's not where we are going.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. HAWKINS: It could be made and it could\nbe developed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, because I don't\nthink that's is a good argument. Why isn't this a\nbenefit or a privilege that's been denied?\nMR. HAWKINS: Whether it -- it may well be a\nbenefit or a privilege, Your Honor, but it isn't shown\nthat there's different treatment than a white employee.\nI mean just to say, I exercised this benefit and\nsomething happened to me negatively, therefore, I have a\nclaim under section 1981, that's not where it's going.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Hawkins, is it at all\nrelevant on the issue that the several courts of appeals\nhave come out the same way both before the 1991\namendment and since the 1991 amendment, and opinions to\nthe contrary are pretty scarce? Does that have any\nweight in a sort of a stare decisis sense?\nMR. HAWKINS: No. Stare decisis applies\nwhen it's the same facts and the same set of law And\nthis is not the same facts and the same set of law.\nThis is section 1991, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I know, but even under the\n1991 the courts of appeals have been fairly uniform on\nthe answer to the very issue we're confronting here.\nIsn't that true?\nMR. HAWKINS: They have, but I would submit,\nYour Honor, that they haven't been following the text of\nthe statute. They have just been relying on Sullivan.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: My question is, are they\nentitled to give any stare decisis weight to a consensus\namong all the courts of appeals both before and after\nthe 1991 amendment.\nMR. HAWKINS: I don't believe the Supreme\nCourt has to give stare decisis --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Don't have to, but does it\nmake sense in trying to understand the stability of the\nlaw generally?\nMR. HAWKINS: Based on our argument it does\nnot, Your Honor.\nThank you. I would like to reserve my time,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Hyndman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CYNTHIA H. HYNDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. HYNDMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI'd like to address the questions that\nJustice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer raised about the\neffectiveness of section 1981 if there is no right to\nbring an action for retaliation. Section 1981 doesn't\nprovide any specific remedies or any type of enforcement\nmechanism. It can only be enforced through a private\nlawsuit. Petitioner's basically asking this Court to\nallow an employer to be able to fire an employee who\nbrought a private lawsuit to enforce his section 1981\nrights.\nIf the Court were to allow employers to do\nthat, then any employer or contracting party would have\nthe ability to exempt themselves from section 1981\nliability. Take the example of a person who complains\nthat he was not promoted because of his race in\nviolation of section 1981. His employer fires him for\nmaking that complaint. If he did not have protection\nunder section 1981 against retaliation, he would never\nhave the opportunity to remedy that discriminatory\npromotion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a good argument to\nCongress. Congress should enact a retaliatory\nprovision. But the statute says what it says, and what\nit says is that there has to be discrimination on the\nbasis of race. And firing somebody for -- in\nretaliation for making a complaint is not firing him on\nthe basis of race. Indeed, the person making the\ncomplaint may not have been the person who was racially\ndiscriminated against. You would acknowledge that you\ncouldn't fire -- if retaliations claims lie, you\ncouldn't fire a white whistleblower who says this\nemployer has been discriminating against blacks.\nWouldn't that white whistleblower have a cause of action\nfor being fired?\nMS. HYNDMAN: They would in fact have a\ncause of action, Justice Scalia. But this Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: On your theory, but that\nhas nothing to do with the text of the statute, which\nrequires discrimination on the basis of race. I agree\nwith you entirely that it would make sense to provide a\ncause of action for retaliation, but we don't write\nstatutes. We read them. And there's nothing in this\nstatute that says that.\nMS. HYNDMAN: This Court held in the Jackson\ncase that discrimination on the basis -- that\nretaliation when there was a complaint about sex\ndiscrimination constituted discrimination on the basis\nof sex. So it follows that here under section 1981 if\nsomeone makes a complaint about race discrimination and\nthey are retaliated against that they are being\ndiscriminated against on the basis of race.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you can say that, but\nit doesn't make any sense.\nMS. HYNDMAN: Well, that's what the Court\nheld in Jackson, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It didn't make any sense\nthen, either.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if we rule\nin your favor, why would anyone ever bring a Title VII\naction if they could bring a 1981 action?\nMS. HYNDMAN: There's a lot of reasons to\nbring a Title VII action, Your Honor. Title VII allows\nan employee to go to the EEOC, and the EEOC has a lot of\nadvantages. And so you can bring both a Title VII and a\nsection 1981 claim.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. So if\nyou bring -- you'd at least bring them both, right,\nbecause --\nMS. HYNDMAN: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- 1981 allows you\nto get out of the Title VII cap on damages?\nMS. HYNDMAN: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or isn't that\nrendering Congress' careful -- I mean the 1991\nlegislation was a careful compromise. In exchange for\nthe expansions of Title VII, they put caps on the\ndamages. You would allow them to keep the expansion,\nbut do away with the caps.\nMS. HYNDMAN: Congress said specifically\nin -- in the 1991 Civil Rights Act that the damage caps\ndo not apply if an employee has a right under section\n1981 and so --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you're just\nbegging the question. You're assuming you have the\nright that's at issue here today.\nMS. HYNDMAN: Well -- and we do have the\nright that's at issue here today, because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When were -- when there\ndamages, as opposed to back pay, added as a remedy for\nTitle VII?\nMS. HYNDMAN: Title VII damages were added,\ncompensatory and punitive damages were added, in the\n1991 Civil Rights Act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it wasn't that it was\ncut back, as the Chief suggested.\nMS. HYNDMAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's the first time ever\nTitle VII plaintiffs were entitled to get money damages\nas distinguished from simply back pay?\nMS. HYNDMAN: That's absolutely --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, why do\nthey put the caps in? I mean, I do think that is a\nlimitation on the remedy they provided. They provided a\ndamage remedy with a very clear cap and it's not a\nparticularly generous cap, either.\nMS. HYNDMAN: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you would allow\nthem to completely obliterate that cap under any case\nthat could be brought under 1981.\nMS. HYNDMAN: And Congress clearly made\nthat -- made that choice.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you say it's clear,\nbut neither you or the government seems to tell me any\nwords in this statute. Your argument is that we should\ncreate a cause of action in order to make this\neffective. I understand that argument. I think the\nCourt's cases stand against it, and if you want to --\nbut it seems to me that you're admitting that nothing in\nthe words of the statute as amended help you. And the\ngovernment -- which as well is an impairment, which I\nthink is quite wrong because that's not what section (c}\nintended for. But that's almost an admission on the\ngovernment's part that it can't find any words in\nsection (b) either.\nMS. HYNDMAN: The words in the statute that\nprovide the basis for this claim is that you are\nentitled to the same rights to make and enforce\ncontracts as white citizens. And this Court has\nconsistently interpreted that to mean --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that was there\nbefore -- but that was there as of the time of\nPatterson.\nMS. HYNDMAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So then Congress did\nnothing by the amendment to help your case.\nMS. HYNDMAN: What the Court did to help our\ncase was that after Patterson was decided and before the\nsection -- before the Civil Rights Act of 1991 was\npassed, the lower courts had interpreted Patterson to\nrestrict retaliation claims because they generally\ninvolve post formation conduct. And what Congress made\nclear in the -- in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 is that\nthey wanted to have protection throughout the entire\ncontractual relationship.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Patterson was not a\nretaliation case.\nMS. HYNDMAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Patterson was a discharge\nand harassment case.\nMS. HYNDMAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the words do seem to\ncover that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. But your point is\nthat Patterson made a number of lower courts think that\nretaliation was no longer a viable cause of action.\nMS. HYNDMAN: That's absolutely right,\nJustice --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Before Patterson they had\nall thought retaliation was a cause of action.\nMS. HYNDMAN: They consistently thought\nthere was a cause of action for retaliation based upon\nSullivan.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But nothing that you\nargued so far shows that the words of the statute as\namended, that is to say new subsection (b), help your\ncase.\nMS. HYNDMAN: The words of the statute that\nhelp us establish the cause of action are that it\nmade -- that Congress made clear that the entire\ncontractual relationship would be covered from the\nbeginning of the contractual relationship through the\nend, through termination. And coupling that with the\noriginal words of the statute that lower courts had\ninterpreted to allow a cause of action for retaliation\nand with subsection (c), which uses broader language, it\nsays \"impairment by discrimination\" -- under this\nCourt's holding in Jackson --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I do not read subsection\n(c) as giving substantive rights. I mean, you can argue\nabout that. I think you have to talk about (b), and I\nthink you have a valid point when they say that they're\nextending the protection for the life of the contract.\nBut I still want to know what particular words in\nsection (b) you rely on? \"Benefit\"? \"Privilege\"?\nMS. HYNDMAN: Any of those could apply,\nJustice Kennedy. But the -- what Congress was\nlegislating against was this Court's restriction in\nPatterson and saying that the rights that are protected\nare only those rights at the making of the contract and\nthe enforcement of the contract. And they expanded the\nlanguage to cover the entire contractual relationship.\nSo that, for example, here where you have a termination\ncaused by retaliation, then you would have a cause of\naction for retaliation under the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess those court of\nappeals cases pre-1991 that found there was a\nretaliation claim, right, those cases were just wrong as\nto whether there was any post-contract claim? Right? I\nmean, they were wrong about that. Patterson, in effect,\nsaid you're wrong.\nMS. HYNDMAN: Patterson said you were wrong.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So if they were wrong about\nwhether there's a post-contract claim, why wouldn't they\nbe wrong about whether there's a retaliation claim?\nMS. HYNDMAN: There were --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know why we should\ngive deference to them on the one point when they've\nbeen proven wrong on the other one.\nMS. HYNDMAN: They based that on -- on this\nCourt's reading in Sullivan. And Sullivan interpreted\nthe companion statute to section 1981, which was section\n1982.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because it's ironic to say\nall those cases were wrong when Congress agreed with\nthem and disagreed with Patterson.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But is the rationale of\nthose cases -- and it's important to get the right\nrationale. If I say this and I'm wrong tell me I'm\nwrong. And I thought that the heart of it is not that\nthe retaliated -- the act of retaliation is\ndiscrimination. It isn't. What they say is when the\nwhite man helps the black man from being discriminated\nagainst, it falls within the statute, not because you've\ndiscriminated against the black man, but because if it\ndidn't fall within the statute it would seriously erode\nor destroy the black man's right. That's what it seemed\nto me Douglas said in Sullivan.\nMS. HYNDMAN: That's correct, Justice\nBreyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so then we're looking\nvery hard in a place for a word that couldn't be there.\nMS. HYNDMAN: I would agree with that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that was true in\nSullivan because a property owner who wants to sell is\nin a particularly advantageous position to enforce the\nrights of the buyer. It's part of his own contract.\nAnd to extend it to the situation we have here is quite\nan extension of Sullivan in my view.\nMS. HYNDMAN: Well, I would disagree with\nthat respectfully, Justice Kennedy. I would say here,\nwhen you have the person who was the victim of the\ndiscrimination, who was also, who was complaining about\nthe discrimination and then gets fired, he's in actually\na better position than the white homeowner was in\nSullivan.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you agreed with\nJustice Breyer that we're looking for a word that\ncouldn't be there, you said yes, but it is in fact a\nword that is there in about 37 other statutes, right?\nMS. HYNDMAN: Those statutes --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The word could be\nthere. I'm not saying whether it has to be there or\nnot. But it certainly could be there, and it's not\nhere.\nMS. HYNDMAN: The word \"retaliation.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMS. HYNDMAN: -- does not appear in -- in\nthose. There's actually very few Federal statutes where\nthe actual word \"retaliation\" appears. But the other\nstatutes that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they provide a\nspecific cause of action for retaliation, correct?\nMS. HYNDMAN: They do, but there is no\nspecific cause of action provided in section 1981 at\nall. And this Court has already held that there is a\nprivate cause of action under section 1981, and what\nwe're asking --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this -- the\nquestion I asked your friend and I'll ask you as well.\nI think you have a case under Sullivan, which\nrecognized, although it's 1982, this type of action.\nBut Sullivan would not come out the same way today given\nAlexander against Sandoval and our new approach to\nstatutory interpretation. So if you're concerned about\nstare decisis, which body of law do you give effect to,\nthe Sullivan case or our more recent cases on how to\nread statutes?\nMS. HYNDMAN: I think you give effect to\nSullivan in this situation, and the reason is because at\nthe time that Congress was legislating and amending\nsection 1981, and it was acting against the backdrop of\nthis Court's jurisprudence, it had Patterson in front of\nit, it had -- it knew that Sullivan was still good law.\nIt knew that this Court had repeatedly directed that\nsection 1981 and section 1982 be construed similarly;\nand Patterson did not address the specific situation\nthat was in Sullivan, that is whether you could bring a\ncause of action for retaliation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, by 1991\nour new approach to reading statutes was pretty clearly\nestablished.\nMS. HYNDMAN: That's correct. But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if Congress were\nlooking at both of those bodies of law, then wouldn't\nthe normal care be for it to put in a retaliation\nprovision?\nMS. HYNDMAN: If they were legislating on a\nclean slate I might agree with that Justice -- Chief\nJustice Roberts. But in this situation they were not\nlegislating on a clean slate. What they were doing was\namended one of the oldest civil rights acts in this\ncountry, the Civil Rights Act of 1866. And given that\nthey were going to amend that law and they amended it\nbased upon what this Court had said in Patterson, and I\nthink under those circumstances it -- they wouldn't\nnecessarily go and create and write a reticulated\nstatute such as the modern antidiscrimination statutes\nare.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You're saying they would\nhave -- you're saying they would have added an express\nretaliation provision in 1981 in 1991 if they had\nthought that the mode of reasoning in Sullivan was no\nlonger sound? Is that what this comes down to?\nMS. HYNDMAN: I don't know that that's\nnecessarily true. I think they -- they legislated\nagainst the backdrop both of Sullivan and the lower\ncourts' consistent recognition of a cause of action.\nJUSTICE ALITO: When you say they legislated\nagainst the backdrop, you're -- are you not relying on\nsomething they didn't do, rather than anything that they\ndid?\nMS. HYNDMAN: I wouldn't necessarily agree\nwith that, Justice Alito. I would --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The interpretation was\nconsistent with this -- was it 2005, long after those\nother new approach statutes, decisions were on the\nbooks. Jackson was in 2005.\nMS. HYNDMAN: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg; and at that time this Court said that you look\nto the language of the statute, and there in Title IX\nthe language was broad. It was a general ban on\ndiscrimination, such as we have in section 1981 and\nsection 1982, and in fact the Jackson court relied on\nSullivan and relied on this Court's interpretation of\nSullivan to find that there was a cause of action for\nretaliation under Title IX.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What I'm -- what I'm\ntaking away from the argument is that if I were to write\nthis opinion in your favor, I would have to say that\nit's necessary to imply a cause of action prohibiting\nretaliation in order to make these other words\neffective. And that seems to me a very limited argument\nand a very difficult argument for you to prevail upon,\ngiven the authorities and the approach of the Court that\nwe've discussed.\nMS. HYNDMAN: Well, the Court has already\nimplied a cause of action and the question is whether --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand that, and --\nand there certainly is a cause of action as to all the\nterms in the contract, but you want to add -- for me to\nadd a new term. You can't use the existing terms to say\nthat there is a cause of action other -- that helps your\nclient, other than that there is a general approach that\nthere is protection post-contract formation. I would\nhave to agree with that; and I don't think you can get\nout of it impairment.\nMS. HYNDMAN: Well, the language in this\nstatute that guarantees the same rights to make and\nenforce contracts by citizens provides that basis, based\non this Court's decision in Jackson.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now you're making\nenforcement, as with Patterson.\nMS. HYNDMAN: I'm sorry. I didn't hear --\nI'm sorry, I didn't hear you, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now you're just talking\nabout make or enforce and that brings us right back to\nwhere we started.\nMS. HYNDMAN: But -- subsection (b) defines\nmake and enforce more broadly. And that was the purpose\nof the language in section 1981(d), that was to make\nclear that the terms make and enforce contracts cover\nthe entire contractual relationship, from the beginning\nof the relationship to the end of it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To the extent your\nargument relies so heavily on Sullivan, I went back and\nread it, and rather than an implied right of action case\nit looked to me like a third party standing case.\nMS. HYNDMAN: And I know there is some\ndisagreement about that, but the Court in Jackson found\nthat -- it did find that Sullivan did stand for the\nproposition that there was a cause of action for\nretaliation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I think --\nthat's right. Now I get back to another stare decisis\nquestion. Do I rely on what Sullivan actually said, or\nI do I rely on Jackson's reinterpretation of Sullivan?\nMS. HYNDMAN: Well, if you look at what\nSullivan actually said, Chief Justice Roberts, I think\nyou would find that you could read it more expansively\nthat just a third party standing case. In that case the\nwhite lessor, Mr. Sullivan, had been expelled from the\ncorporation after he advocated the rights of his black\nlessee, Mr. Freeman; and he was allowed under -- the\nCourt allowed him to bring his action to recover damages\nand get injunctive relief, because he himself was\nexpelled from that corporation. So he was the person\nthat had an had injury in that circumstance. So I think\nthat it's not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree, though,\nthat the language in the opinion focuses on it as a\nthird party standing question.\nMS. HYNDMAN: The -- the Court says that\nMr. Sullivan does have standing to bring the action. I\ndo agree with that, but if you read the entire opinion,\nyou would see that they also say that Mr. Sullivan had\nthe right to bring his action for damages and injunctive\nrelief.\nJust to sum up, because this Court in\nSullivan and Jackson has recognized that persons who\nthemselves were not victims of discrimination must be\nprotected against retaliation when they advocate the\nrights of those victims; otherwise the underlying\ndiscrimination would go unchecked -- we are not asking\nthe Court to do anything here that they haven't already\ndone. We are just asking that the victim of the\ndiscrimination here, Mr. Humphries, have the same\nprotection against retaliation that this Court has\nalready recognized that his advocate would have. Thank\nyou.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nGeneral Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThis Court has already inferred a private\ncause of action under section 1981. So the question\nbefore the Court now is simply the scope of the basic\nguarantee in section 1981 and particularly whether it\nprohibits retaliation against someone who exercised\ntheir undoubted right to complain about racial\ndiscrimination in a contractual process.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a little more\ncomplicated than that. We inferred that cause of action\nin the bad old days, when we were inferring causes of\naction all over the place.\nNow, the position the Government takes here\nis that we should infer this new cause of action to\nassist the one that's already on the books. Is the\nGovernment going to be consistent in this position? And\nyou want us to in the future go back to our prior\npractice of readily inferring causes of action that are\nnot set forth in the -- in the text of this statute?\nIs the Government willing to live with that?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, Justice Scalia, we're\nnot asking to you to go back to the bad old days. But I\nthink it's important to recognize that we are simply\nasking you to interpret the scope of the cause of action\nyou've already inferred. And I think that's consistent\nwith the way this Court has approached 1981 cases.\nPatterson would be a great example. This Court in\nPatterson didn't say, are we going to infer a new cause\nof action for harassment? No. This Court interpreted\nthe basic prohibition of 1981 and said it didn't cover\nharassment. We think if you interpret the basic\nprohibitions in 1981, it covers retaliation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Patterson was still the bad\nold days. When do you think the bad old days ended?\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Patterson was 1989. I\ndon't think anybody thinks Patterson was the bad old\ndays.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I'm sorry. I was\nthinking of Sullivan.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: The bad old days ended\nwhen you got on the Court, Mr. Justice Scalia.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Now, I think the\nconsiderations of precedent as well speak very loudly\nhere. And Justice Alito asked the question, what would\ncause the Court to interpret 1981 and 1982 differently?\nAnd the answer is absolutely nothing. These are two --\nthese aren't just two closely related statutes that were\ncodified together.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you asking us to\ninfer, to find implied in the words a cause of action\nagainst retaliation?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No. We're asking to you\ninterpret the cause of action that exists --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What words --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- to include\nretaliation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What words in the statute?\nAnd not \"impairment\" because I don't agree with the\ngovernment on that.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Okay, Justice Kennedy. I\nthink part of the disconnect may be, if I could try to\naddress this, is there are two reasons you might think\nthat retaliation isn't covered. One reason you might\nthink retaliation isn't covered is because it's not\ndiscrimination on the basis of race. The other reason\nthat you might think retaliation is not covered and the\nreason that the court of appeals, post-Patterson,\npre-1991, thought that retaliation wasn't covered was\nsimply that it was post-formation conduct. And as to\nthat, what is clear is that 1981(b) provides a textual\nanswer to that. A --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: A third reason is that the\nword isn't in the statute.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well -- but neither is the\nword \"harassment,\" Justice Kennedy. Neither, frankly,\nis the words \"discrimination on the basis of race.\"\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's a benefit,\nprivilege, and term of the contract --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- to me fairly obvious to\nme to include harassment. That was the situation in\nPatterson. That's what Congress sought to address.\nRetaliation is something quite different.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Sure, but I don't think\nthere's any doubt since Mr. Humphries was fired that he\nno longer enjoys the benefits and privileges of his\ncontractual relationship. They were clearly interfered\nwith. His rights under 1981 are clearly implicated. It\nwould seem to me the only argument that he's not covered\nis that he was retaliated -- he was fired, he lost his\ncontractual relationships not because he was\nAfrican-American --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then why were you --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- but he claimed -- -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- talking about\nimpairment in your brief?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: We were making a slightly\ndifferent point, Justice Kennedy, which is we think this\ncase is a fortiori from the Jackson case in a couple of\nrespects. First and foremost, we think that a 1982\nprecedent, if it governs Title IX, ought to a fortiorari\ngovern 1981.\nBut the second way we think this case is a\nfortiori from Jackson is that the same textual obstacles\nare not present here that the Jackson -- that the\nJackson dissenters identified. You know, the Jackson\ndissenters didn't say that retaliation isn't a form of\ndiscrimination. They said it's not discrimination on\nthe basis of sex. And if you look at the text of\n1981(a), (b), and (c), you find that it's actually more\ncapacious language, and you don't have the same problem.\nIt doesn't say \"discrimination on the basis of race.\"\nNow, to be sure, we're not saying that 1981\nisn't a race statute; of course it is. But those exact\nwords don't appear and don't provide a stumbling block.\nAnd if you look at the form that 1981 takes, it doesn't\ntake the form of an express prohibition of\ndiscrimination on the basis of race; it actually\ntextually takes the form of a guarantee of equal\ntreatment. And it seems to me that a guarantee of equal\ntreatment quite naturally is violated not just by the\nbasic discrimination but is also violated by retaliating\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if you have --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- against someone for\nexercising their rights.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you have an\nemployer who fires everybody who complains about\npractices at work, that would not be covered\nretaliation?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, you're\nright. Judge Easterbrook's hypothetical of the equal\nopportunity retaliator I think as a theoretical matter\nwould not be covered by this statute. But of course I\nthink it's only an interesting theoretical possibility,\nbecause I rather doubt that employer would have many\nemployees in practice. I mean, in practice --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think it's\nunusual for employers to have a practice that anybody\nwho alleges that I've committed a violation of Federal\nlaw, I want to get rid of them?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I -- I actually do\nthink that's unusual, and I do think if an employer -- I\nmean, just in looking at the cases that are actually\ndecided, you don't see that as the nondiscriminatory\ndefense that many employers resort to. And I think as a\npractical matter that's just not the position that\nthey're taking. And I think as a practical matter\nyou're going to see that those are covered by the\nstatute.\nYou -- Mr. Chief Justice, you also asked\nabout stare decisis and which cases that this Court\nshould point to. I think there are a couple reasons why\nSullivan is the precedent that this Court should follow\nin this case. First of all, this Court followed it in a\nless analogous context just a few terms ago in Jackson.\nSecond, this Court has a whole line of\ncases, including Tillman and Runyon, that treat 1982\ncases as binding authority for section 1981 purposes.\nSo if this Court were to turn its back on Sullivan, I\nthink it would also be turning its back on cases like --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have any\ndoubt that Sullivan would come out differently today\nunder our current analysis?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It -- I mean, it's hard to\nsay. I mean, you know, Jackson was just three terms\nago, Mr. Chief Justice, so -- and I don't know how\nJackson would have been decided without the benefit of\nSullivan. I certainly think that the current Court\nwould be a tougher Court to make the arguments that\ncarried the day in Sullivan than the Court at the time,\nbut --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It would be a tougher Court\nto make the argument on inferring a cause of action,\nperiod. But I don't know whether it would be a tougher\nCourt to make the argument that, if there is a cause of\naction, it's got to include this, which was your point a\nmoment ago.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And I think that's a very\nfair point, Justice Souter. And I guess I would say\nthat, just to amplify something my co-counsel said, I\nreally do think -- I mean, the Jackson Court took the --\nthe Sullivan case to be something other than a\nthird-party standing case and to be a case about\nretaliation. I really think that that is the correct\nreading of the opinion. If you look at the critical\nparagraph on page --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The correct reading\nof Jackson or of Sullivan?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Of both, but more to the\npoint, of Sullivan. If you go to page 237 of the\nSullivan opinion, after the Court's disposed of\nFreeman's claim the whole discussion of Sullivan's claim\nis prefaced with the observation \"we turn now to\nSullivan's claim for\" expulsion -- \"for advocacy on\nFreeman's behalf.\"\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, and you\nin your brief bracketed that and just made that\nequivalent to retaliation. I don't think it is because\nhe was arguing that he didn't -- he was himself injured\nbecause he couldn't sell his own property. He has an\ninterest in his own property. And that just isn't true\nin the standard retaliation case of the type we're\ndiscussing.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But, Justice Kennedy, if\nthat were the only claim that Sullivan could bring,\ni.e., if he could only bring the second half of the\nleasehold claim that Freeman had, I would agree with\nyour reading of Sullivan. But what the Court is focused\non is not Sullivan's ability to sue for his inability to\nsell to Freeman. They allow him to sue because he was\nexpelled from the property owner's association after the\nfact. Now, why was he expelled from the property\nowner's association? Not because of his race; but\nbecause he had advocated on Freeman's behalf. The point\nabout Sullivan getting to sue for his expulsion from --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But a seller is -- or a\nwould-be seller is always a built-in advocate for a\nbuyer if some third person interferes with the contract.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I agree with that, but I\nthink what's critical is that he was allowed to recover\nnot just for that injury but for his expulsion from the\nproperty owner's association. And that's not an injury\nthat was an obvious injury to Freeman at all. But more\nto the point, it doesn't really matter if Freeman and\nSullivan can sue for that or just Sullivan. The point\nis somebody could sue for Sullivan's expulsion from the\nproperty owner's association. And I don't understand\nhow that's anything other than a retaliation holding.\nAnd as I said, this Court on a number of occasions has\ngiven 1982 holdings even stare decisis effect, using\nthose words in Runyon in the 1981 context. And so I\nthink that's also something that this Court would have\nto confront.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If we thought --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: When --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If we thought Sullivan was\nincorrectly decided, what should we do? Should we say\nwe accept it insofar as it interpreted section 1982, but\nwe don't necessarily have to extend it to 1981, to take\nan approach similar to what we did in the recent John R.\nSand & Gravel case? Or do we have to apply the\nreasoning in the 1981 case because of the close\nrelationship between the two provisions?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think you have to apply\nits reasoning. That would be consistent with decisions\nlike Runyon and Tillman that say that you apply 1982\ncases and 1981.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Hawkins, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. HAWKINS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HAWKINS: Respondent and the government\nand its amicus arguments are more appropriate on the\nfloor of Congress debating whether or not to amend\nsection 1981 to include retaliation.\nInstead of giving the clear and plain\nmeaning of the terms and the ordinary and natural\ndefinitions, the Seventh Circuit relied on extrinsic\nissues to reach its decision in violation of Article 1\nSection 1 of the Constitution. It exercised its will\ninstead of its judgment in violation of the principles\nset forth in Jones versus Bock, where this Court had\nsaid the judge's job is to construe the statute, not to\nmake it better.\nGeorge Washington said in 1790 \"I've always\nbeen persuaded that the success of our nation and our\ngovernment depends upon the acceptance its people and\nthat that would depend upon the interpretation and\nexecution of its laws. Therefore, it is important that\nthe judicial system should not only be independent in\nits operation but as perfect as possible in its\nformation.\" To follow the text of the statute, this\nCourt's interpretations of section 1981 and the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is no longer\nWashington, right?\nMR. HAWKINS: I understand, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I didn't know where\nhe stopped and you began.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HAWKINS: The Seventh Circuit's decision\nshould be reversed. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
