        "content": "(10:16 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in Case 06-937, Quanta Computer v. LG\nElectronics.\nMs. Mahoney.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nUnder this Court's exhaustion cases,\nexhaustion has always been triggered when two criteria\nhave been satisfied and the district court properly\ndismissed these claims because it found that they were\nsatisfied here on the undisputed facts. The first is\nthat there must be an authorized sale under the patent\nthat was allegedly infringed. That's never been in\ndispute in this case. The Federal Circuit recognized\nthat Intel was authorized to sell these components under\nthe system and method patents at issue in the case that\nhave been allegedly infringed.\nAnd the second criteria is that the article\nsold must be one that falls within the protection of the\npatent that was allegedly infringed, here the system and\nmethod patents. But as Univis holds, that test doesn't\napply simply to articles that would directly infringe\nthe patent, because the law with contributory\ninfringement standards provides that protection to the\npatent owner also to articles that would contributorily\ninfringe. In other words --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Mahoney, can I just\nget one thing straight in my mind. Which transaction\ntriggered the exhaustion doctrine in your judgment, the\ngeneral license to Intel or the sale by Intel to Quanta.\nMS. MAHONEY: I think they work in\ncombination here, Your Honor, because once the sale\nwas -- once the license was entered into with Intel and\nonce unrestricted rights were given to make, use and\nsell components that would infringe, otherwise infringe\nthese patents, there was really nothing else that could\nhappen --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Was the license\nunrestricted? That's one of the reasons I asked the\nquestion. Wasn't there a use restriction on the resale?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, there was -- what there\nwas, the sale was authorized. The sale was authorized.\nWhat --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: On the condition that it\nbe sold to someone who would not use it on non-Intel\nproducts.\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't think that's what the\nlower courts found and I don't think that's what the\nargument has ever been, Your Honor. I think this is\njust like Bobbs-Merrill. There is a -- this Court has\nrecognized that there is a difference between actually\nconditioning the seller's authority to sell to someone\nwho's going to use it for some prohibited purpose, and\nthat would be a case like General Talking Pictures,\nwhere it says, you do not have authority to sell to\nsomeone who's going to use it for the home market. But\nBobbs-Merrill says if what you do instead -- it was a\ncopyright case that was applied in Motion Picture\nPatents. If what you do instead is you give them\nauthority to sell, you don't say you'll be in breach if\nyou sell it to somebody who's going to sell books at\nbelow the retail price I've specified, if instead what\nyou do is say, you have to agree you'll give them notice\nthat the -- that the owner of the invention, or in that\ncase the copyright, is not agreeing to your use of these\nbooks or sale of these books at below a certain price,\nthat doesn't count. There's still an authorized sale,\nthat when -- that you can't -- that the patent owner\ncan't try to retain part of the monopoly right to sell.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if that's true\nthen this case really isn't a big deal at all. It just\ndepends on exactly how you word the contract when the\npatentee sells it to a purchaser. You can word it -- in\nother words, you can word it in such a way that the\npatentee's rights extend further downstream and you're\nsaying all this case turns on is whether the wording\nhere was correct or not.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, the wording hasn't been\nin dispute, but a lot of important things turn on it,\nbecause of course if Intel didn't have the authority to\nmake these sales, it would be liable for contributory\ninfringement. And undoubtedly when Intel decided how\nmuch to pay for this license it cared deeply about\nwhether it was going to be exposed to that liability.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I understand\nyour position to -- to acknowledge that they could have\nstructured the sale to Intel in such a way as to achieve\nthe same result that you're saying is so bad under the\npatent laws.\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nOnce they have an authorized sale, then the results are\ndifferent, because if there has been an authorized sale\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I give you a specific\nexample? I think the Chief has something on this order\nin mind. Could the patentee say to the licensee, to the\nIntel, that, I license you to sell only to buyers who\nhave a license from the patentee? Could -- could the\nlicensee be limited in that way?\nMS. MAHONEY: They could do that, and let me\nexplain the consequences of doing that. If Intel then\nunder those circumstances sold to a buyer who did not\nhave a license, Intel would be liable for contributory\ninfringement because it wouldn't be an authorized sale,\nand the buyer would be liable for infringement because\nit didn't acquire the goods through an authorized sale.\nIf the buyer instead has the license, has obtained the\nlicense from the patentowner, then there has been an\nauthorized sale and any remedies that the owner of the\npatent would have against the buyer would be those found\nin contract, because the triggering line under this\nCourt's cases is has there been an authorized sale? And\nthis makes perfect sense because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But explain to me --\nperhaps I should ask Mr. Phillips this question -- but\nwhy isn't it done that way? The way -- if the patentee\nwants to maintain control further down the line, why\ndoesn't the patentee just limit the licensee to selling\nto people who are licensed?\nMS. MAHONEY: Presumably because in this\ncircumstance -- it's not in the record -- but presumably\nIntel wouldn't agree to these terms unless it in fact\nwas given authority to sell, no matter how it was going\nto be used, because otherwise it would still be on the\nhook for liability. And -- and presumably they could\nhave done something that would have required an\nagreement with -- you know, between -- only sell to\nsomeone with an agreement. But for whatever reason the\nparties didn't negotiate that term. Perhaps Intel\nwasn't willing to do it that way.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the parties are\nunwilling to spell out exactly how this is going to work\nout in their contract, and each side, it prefers to take\ntheir chances on how the Federal Circuit's going to\nrule. It's easier to sell these things if they're not\nencumbered by these additional license requirements and\nthe manufacturer presumably gets a lot more, but there's\na lot of uncertainty, uncertainty that could have been\ncured by how the contract was drafted, and people prefer\nto live with that uncertainty and litigate rather than\nclear it up in the contract.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, I think that this\nCourt's ruling would certainly make things clear, but I\nthink that the language of the contract recognizes that\nthe -- specifically says that, notwithstanding anything\nto the contrary, the ordinary operation of patent\nexhaustion is supposed to apply here. In other words, I\nthink Intel knew --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Fine, and the person\nwho wrote that provision knows that the question of how\nthe patent-exhaustion doctrine applies is the subject of\ngreat confusion, so much confusion that the Supreme\nCourt's going to have to decide it, and yet they put\nthat in there rather than spelling out in the contract\nexactly which they had in mind, whether or not you could\nimpose these further restrictions or couldn't.\nMS. MAHONEY: But, Your Honor, I think that\nunder this Court's decision in Univis Lens, as the\ndistrict court recognized, the answer in this case is\nactually quite clear what the patent-exhaustion doctrine\nwould require. And the reason it's clear --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it wasn't\nclear to the Federal Circuit, I guess.\nMS. MAHONEY: It wasn't clear to the Federal\nCircuit, but it was clear to the district court, showing\nthat the idea that somehow it was absolutely known to\neverybody what the outcome of this issue would be is not\ncorrect. The district court, I think correctly,\nunderstood that Univis Lens was the controlling case.\nOf course, the Federal Circuit didn't even cite it. But\nthe district court found that the Univis Lens standard\nwas satisfied because these components were necessarily\nmanufactured in a manner that satisfied, that included\nthe functionality of the system and method patents at\nissue here. At 30a, the district court looks to LGE's\nown claim charts and says that their own allegations\nshow that they were manufactured in a way that met many\nof the limitations of the claims.\nIn addition, at 67 of the petition appendix,\nshe says that by attaching the components, the Intel\nchips, to the -- the other generic wires and memory, it\nnecessarily caused these products to infringe. And, at\n46, she says, \"Failure to follow Intel's design\nspecifications would render the computers inoperable.\"\nSo, this is a case where there's just no\nquestion that if LGE's allegations are correct these\nproducts would have contributorily infringed. So Intel\nknew that in order to avoid potential liability to -- to\nLGE, that it had to get full authority to sell, and it\ndid. And there's never been any dispute about that.\nInstead, there's simply the Federal Circuit's view that\neven if you have an authorized sale, that the\npatentowner is nevertheless allowed to say, okay, I\nauthorize the seller to sell it to anybody, but I want\nto retain the right to control the use of the -- of the\nbuyer. And that's exactly what this Court's cases have\nalways said, with the exception of A.B. Dick, cannot be\ndone because the whole point of the exhaustion doctrine\nis to demarcate the line between where the monopoly\npower to control rights to use and sell end and where\nany rights under contract must begin.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there's one --\nthere's one more wrinkle that you don't expressly advert\nto and that is the argument that what is in issue here\nare the -- are the systems and methods patents, rather\nthan the -- the equipment component patents.\nMS. MAHONEY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that with respect to\nthe equipment component patents nothing is being\nretained, but with respect to the systems and method\npatents nothing was being granted. What is your answer\nto that answer to your argument?\nMS. MAHONEY: It's completely inconsistent\nwith the way the case has been litigated from the outset\nas well as the terms of the contract. At page 5 of the\npetition appendix, the Federal Circuit acknowledges that\nIntel had full authority to sell these components under\nall of the patents, including the system and method\npatents. If it didn't have authority to manufacture and\nsell under the system and method patents, it would be\npotentially liable for contributory infringement. And\nin fact LGE has acknowledged in its brief in footnote 7\nthat Intel isn't potentially liable for contributory\ninfringement under the terms of this agreement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So the answer simply is\nthat that the argument rests upon a mistake of fact\nwhich has not been challenged in the record?\nMS. MAHONEY: It absolutely has not.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMS. MAHONEY: The component patents are not\nat issue here at all. And the idea that you couldn't\nhave one patent on a component and another patent on a\nsystem where the component would contributorily infringe\nis nonsensical. These components had thousands of\npatents on them. And certainly the argument isn't that\nby authorizing the sale of the component all of the\nowner's rights are released in that. If, instead, there\nhad been a sale of a component where a patent owner\nsays, I'll authorize you to sell my -- my -- that\ncomponent under my component patent, but if you sell it\nunder my system patent -- I'm not giving you authority\nto sell it under my system patent, so if you sell it,\nI'm going to sue you for infringement, that didn't\nhappen here, and it's never been litigated in that way.\nInstead, that first criteria of the\nauthorized sale has plainly been satisfied, and the only\nquestion in this case has been whether or not this\nsatisfied the contributory infringement standard that\nUnivis Lens uses to define what articles --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Mahoney, I understand\nthat's really the way it's been litigated, but I have to\nconfess I was puzzled by the court of appeals' statement\nthat the granting of the license constituted a sale for\nexhaustion purposes, and they cited the Masonite case\nfor that proposition, but it doesn't seem to me to\nsupport that proposition.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think all that\nthat really is saying is that at a point when you enter\ninto -- a patentowner enters into an unrestricted\nlicense to make, use, and sell with a manufacturer, then\nat that point any articles that are manufactured under\nthat license, effectively the patent's been exhausted.\nBut I think it's easier to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's not exhausted by the\nmanufacturer, is it?\nMS. MAHONEY: No. For contributorily\ninfringing --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's exhausted under this\nview by the licensee's sale of an article that it\nmanufactured pursuant to the license.\nMS. MAHONEY: But -- right, manufactured\npursuant --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And it seems to think\nthere's no distinction between the sale itself and the\nbasic underlying license, whereas I had thought for\nyears that there was recognized a distinction between\nthose two transactions.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, I think that it just\nmeans that once you have that transaction any sales that\noccur for those articles under that license are going to\nbe exhausted by definition. But, you know, we have\ncertainly focused on the sale of the articles to Quanta\nfrom Intel, and I think, you know, it makes sense to\nlook at it that way.\nAnd, as indicated, there really is -- there\nhave been arguments that somehow this deprives the\npatentowner of the right to collect its full royalty,\nbut that doesn't make any sense. Because if you -- if\nyou look at the rights that are afforded under\ncontributory infringement, what Congress has done in\nSection 271(c) and what this Court had done before was\nto say that if you are the owner of a system patent or a\nmethod patent, you can go ahead and collect your royalty\nwhen someone sells a product that will contributorily\ninfringe.\nIn other words, your -- your product is\nsufficiently -- your patent is sufficiently embodied in\nthose contributorily infringing products that it's\nappropriate for you to collect your royalty there.\nThat's exactly what happened in this case. LGE did get\nits royalty from Intel, did give them authority to sell\nproducts which would otherwise contributorily infringe,\nand now what it's seeking to do is to say, despite the\nauthorized sale, despite the fact it would\ncontributorily infringe, we want to collect another\nroyalty from the buyer of the product that can't use it\nfor any other purpose. Why? Well, because we have --\nwe had them sent a notice that said we wanted to do\nthat.\nUnder this Court's cases, that is completely\nimpermissible. In two cases in particular, Motion\nPicture Patents, they tried to do the exact same thing.\nAnd in the Millinger case the patentowner said that it\nhad never gotten paid for the extension rights under its\npatent. And this Court said: Nope; once you've sold\nthe article, that's the royalty you get.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I see your white light is\non. I have just one question. Are there cases where\nsome downstream restrictions on use might be necessary\nto prevent the patent from becoming worthless, i.e., in\nthe biological area for replication of seeds in\nagriculture and so forth?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, what we're -- exhaustion\nis triggered when -- with respect to the rights to\ncontrol and use. Rights to make are treated\ndifferently.\nUnivis, of course, though, holds that when\nyou're talking about the sale of a contributorily\ninfringing product, you're really talking about the\nright to -- to make it, to use it, to complete the --\ncomplete the article. But I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought Univis was one\nof your principal cases.\nMS. MAHONEY: It is, absolutely. It holds\n-- in other words, what Univis holds is that when you\nhave an article that is uncompleted -- it's not finished\n-- as in this case, by the -- the sale will -- will\nmean, by definition, that you can use it to complete the\narticle.\nI'd like to reserve the remainder of my\ntime. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Mahoney.\nMr. Hungar?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nFor 150 years this Court has held that an\nauthorized sale removes the particular item sold from\nthe protection of the patent laws. The court below\nerroneously transformed that patent-exhaustion doctrine\nfrom a definitional principle that delimits the scope of\nthe patent grant into an optional default assumption\nthat can be discarded at the whim of the patentee.\nIf the rationale of the court of appeals were correct,\nthis Court's decisions in cases like Univis, Motion\nPicture Patents, Straus, Bauer and Boston Store would\nhave to have gone the other way, because in each of\nthose cases this Court held that the exhaustion\nprinciple overrode express restrictions that the\npatentee had attempted to impose on after-sale use or\nresale by an authorized purchaser.\nThis Court should follow its precedents and\nreaffirm the principle that the patent-exhaustion\ndoctrine precludes a patentee from employing the patent\nlaw to enforce post-sale restrictions on use or resale\nby authorized purchasers, that is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hungar, is there a\nreason why Congress codified this doctrine in the\nCopyright Act, but not in the Patent Act?\nMR. HUNGAR: We -- there's nothing in the\nlegislative record that would explain that, Your Honor.\nPresumably it's because Congress wanted to specify\nparticular limits, which Section 109 of the Copyright\nAct does. It wanted to specify particular limits to\ndefine the scope of the doctrine in the copyright\ncontext in a way that it has not sought -- found it\nnecessary to do in the patent area.\nBut there's no legislative history about\nthis. I mean, this Court has said that the 1952 act\ncodified, recodified, and readopted, reaffirmed, the\nprinciples of the Court's cases on infringement\ngenerally. Obviously --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the PTO didn't take\nany position on whether it should be codified?\nMR. HUNGAR: I'm not aware of anything in\nthe legislative history of the 1952 codification on the\nsubject of the patent exhaustion doctrine one way or the\nother; but, obviously, Congress did not express any\ndissatisfaction with it.\nIt did change certain aspects of patent law,\nbut it did not attempt in any way to override or change\nthe effect of the first-sale doctrine, which under this\nCourt's cases has been perfectly clear for well over a\ncentury and has the effect we've suggested.\nAnd we submit that, although the Respondent\nessentially ignores or runs away from the rationale of\nthe court of appeals, we submit it's important for this\nCourt to explicitly address and explicitly reject the\nFederal Circuit's misunderstanding of the\npatent-exhaustion doctrine, its view that a patentee can\nessentially override it simply by attaching a notice to\nthe article that has been sold in an authorized sale.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Although you think\nit can be overridden simply by providing in the contract\nthat the same rights and remedies would be available?\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. I mean, it\ndepends a little bit on what contract we're talking\nabout and what it says. It is true, as Justice Stevens\nindicated, it has always been true, that this Court has\ndeemed a license under a patent to be different from a\nsale of a particular article under a patent. It is the\nsale of the article that exhausts. The license does not\n-- exhaustion doesn't -- isn't relevant at the mere\nlicensing stage.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A mere license can\nprevent the application of the patent-exhaustion\ndoctrine?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, only at the -- only at\nthe level of the licensee. That is, if it is true, as\nMs. Mahoney said, if the -- if LG here had given a\nrestricted license that restricted the right to sell,\nthat said you can only sell in these instances, and if\nIntel then sold outside those permitted instances, that\nwould be patent infringement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it would be\npatent infringement by the use of the product by the\npeople that Intel sold to?\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, because it was an\nunauthorized sale.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would sound\nlike your friend on the other side, the Respondent, had\nactually won in this case.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, that's right. If this\nhad been an authorized sale -- I mean an unauthorized\nsale, they would win. But, of course, it's been\naccepted throughout the case, and the court of appeals\nexplicitly said at page 5A, and it's been undisputed,\nthat Intel had the right to sell these items to these\nPetitioners.\nThey had the right to sell. It was not\ninfringing. And if it's not \"infringing,\" by\ndefinition, it's an \"authorized\" sale. It's authorized\nunder the patent explicitly by the license agreement.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you couldn't put in --\nyou are authorized to sell the bicycle pedals that I\nhave patented only if you impose a restriction that will\ntell the bicycle user that he must send me a check for\n$15 in addition to whatever he pays you. That sounds\nunlawful under contract law.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, it might be lawful. You\ncould certainly do what, in fact, I think some of the\nseed companies --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or you are going to have --\nI mean, there's a doctrine that you cannot impose\nequitable servitude's upon chattel.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's a contract law\ndoctrine.\nMR. HUNGAR: It would not be enforceable as\na matter of patent law against the authorized purchaser.\nIf -- if the licensee does what the licensee is\nobligated to do, it imposes the -- it attaches the\nnotice or it requires the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: My thought is that the\nreason that these things are important and you can't\njust draft your way around them is because there are\nantitrust doctrines, there are contract-law doctrines,\nthat also limit in significant ways what you can and\ncannot write into a contract.\nMR. HUNGAR: That's exactly right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think that's\nan important question. I understood the argument at\npage 16 of your brief to say that the patent-exhaustion\ndoctrine doesn't apply in that situation and that you,\ntherefore, can't have the rights and remedies under\npatent law.\nYou told me earlier that if the person to\nwhom Intel sells the product uses it contrary to the\nlicense stipulation, they would be liable for patent\ninfringement.\nYour answer to Justice Breyer suggests to me\nthat you're saying only that they're liable to -- for\ncontract infringement, and that's a very big difference.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well -- but, Your Honor, it all\ngoes back to the question: Was there an authorized sale\nof the article at issue? If the sale is authorized, if\nwhat the licensee --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sale from whom to\nwhom?\nMR. HUNGAR: The sale from the licensee to\nthe purchaser. The license is not a sale -- is not a\nsale for purposes of the patent exhaustion. I think\nthat the Federal Circuit was just wrong in saying that,\nbecause what the patent-exhaustion doctrine talks about\nis the sale of an article. All the cases say the sale\nof the particular article removes that article from the\n-- from the patent monopoly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what you --\nwell, but what you say in your brief is that in the\nsituation we're talking about the licensee stands in the\nshoes of the patentee. Now, if that's right it seems to\nme that you're telling me that the patent remedies are\navailable and not simply contractual remedies.\nMR. HUNGAR: No. What we're saying is this.\nIf -- if the licensee has a restricted license, that is\nits right to sell is restricted, it can only sell on\nMondays and not on Tuesdays --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- and it sells on a Tuesday.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, or, more\npertinently, it can only sell if the person they sell to\nagrees not to use the product in a certain way.\nMR. HUNGAR: Fine. If they have that\nrestriction and they sell and they do not -- they do not\nobtain the contractual promise of the party that they\nare obligated to obtain, they're violating the terms of\ntheir right to sell. It's patent infringement by the\nseller, and if the buyer uses it it's patent\ninfringement by them as well.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Exactly. That's the\ncritical point. You're telling me that if the buyer, in\nother words, the kind of third person in this chain,\nuses the patented article in a way that is contrary to\nthe license that was given to the second person in the\nchain, then he is liable for contributory infringement\nunder the patent laws and not, as I understood you to\nanswer to Justice Breyer, only under contract law.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you sue under\npatent law or just contract law?\nMR. HUNGAR: If -- in your hypothetical, as\nI understand it, it's an unauthorized sale. The\nlicensee does not have the right to sell under the\npatent in those circumstances, and therefore the\nexhaustion principle does not apply.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But not every infringement\nof the license is necessarily an unauthorized sale.\nMR. HUNGAR: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So there could be a\nrestriction in the license which is not a restriction on\nsale and that could be violated. And the exhaustion\ndoctrine would still apply, and you might have remedies\nin some another theory, i.e., contract.\nMR. HUNGAR: That's correct. That's\ncorrect. Likewise, what happens in the real world is\nthe patentee, if the patentee wants to restrict what\npeople can do downstream, they say to the licensee, you\ncan only sell if you obtain a contractual promise from\nthe purchaser.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are you saying that this\ncase would come out differently if instead of just\nrequiring a notice that the -- the item should only be\nused on Intel products, that had been a condition of the\nlicense. If the license itself said you may manufacture\nand sell to only people who agree to use the product\nexclusively with Intel products?\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes. In if those\ncircumstances, if Quanta had -- if that -- if that\nlicense condition --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So the key fact in this\ncase is it was just a requirement of giving notice\nrather than a condition in the license?\nMR. HUNGAR: But let me be clear. The key\ndistinction is between an authorized sale and an\nunauthorized sale. So if there is an authorized sale,\nthat is, Intel --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand that.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I think I haven't been\nclear, because I want to make sure that that the\nconsequences are clear --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The big key is what is an\nauthorized sale? And I'm asking you if the -- if the\nlicense agreement to the -- to Intel had said you may\nonly sell to people who agree to use the products on the\npatentee's products, that then would -- and they did\notherwise, they didn't get -- then it would not have\nbeen an authorized sale?\nMR. HUNGAR: Correct, and it would be patent\ninfringement. But if they sold and the purchaser did\nagree, they did enforce that requirement, they did\nrequire the purchaser to sign a promise -- may I finish,\nYour Honor -- to promise to limit the use and the\npurchaser then violated that promise, the point is that\nwould be a breach of contract but it would not be patent\ninfringement because the sale was authorized, the patent\nmonopoly ends and only contract principles control\nthereafter.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Hungar.\nMr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nJustice Souter, I want to go to your\nquestion, because, frankly, I think it is the key to the\nentirety of this case. And that is, what is the \"it\"\nthat we are talking about? And what's absolutely\ncritical here is, yes, there was -- you know, this is\nthe first sale doctrine. It's easy to call it\npatent-exhaustion, but the truth is it's the first sale\ndoctrine.\nAnd the question is, what was sold here?\nAnd the only sale that was involved here was the\nchipsets. And there is a completely separate patent\nthat deals with the rest of the system and that deals\nwith the method. And nothing -- and this is the key\npoint of this. The exhaustion doctrine only goes as far\nas the sale.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there's\nnothing to do with these chipsets other than use them in\nthe computers. I mean, you don't put them on your\nshelf. They're not good for anything other than using\nin the computer. So saying there's a separate patent\nfor how you use them with the other systems doesn't seem\nto be very significant.\nMR. PHILLIPS: It would be -- and that's why\nyou would ordinarily -- you don't deal with this as an\nexhaustion issue. That's why you would deal with this\nas an implied licensing issue.\nThe assumption would be, in the absence of\nclear evidence to the contrary, that if I'm selling you\nsomething that only has a single use and that's in a\nseparate patent, that you in fact are being licensed to\ngo and use it that way. But what's absolutely critical\nin this case is that both the district court and the\ncourt of appeals specifically rejected the notion that\nthere was any implied license. And it's important to\nrealize this.\nEven as we approach this case, we didn't sue\nfor any of the activities that predated when the other\nside received its notice. We sued only for the\nactivities post notice. Why? Because at that stage it\nwas absolutely clear that there was no implied license\nany longer and there's no basis for expanding the\nexhaustion doctrine to try to fill that void.\nThe exhaustion doctrine ought to be retained\nas a very narrow first sale doctrine, because it doesn't\nhave any congressional support or approval at this\npoint. It is a logical way of proceeding. It protects\npeople against being surprised when they purchase a\nparticular product. But to go beyond that and to say\nthat simply because that sale, that particular product\nis, quote, an \"essential feature\" of a separate patent\nand therefore you have now exhausted the rights to that\nsecond patent seems to me a stretch that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, there's a reason, I\nguess, that would be so. Imagine that I want to buy\nsome bicycle pedals, so I go to the bicycle shop. These\nare fabulous pedals. The inventor has licensed somebody\nto make them, and he sold them to the shop, make and\nsell them. He sold them to the shop. I go buy the\npedals. I put it in my bicycle. I start pedaling down\nthe road.\nNow, we don't want 19 patent inspectors\nchasing me or all of the other companies and there are\nmany doctrines in the law designed to stop that. One is\nthe equitable servitudes on chattel. Another is the\nexhaustion of a patent. And now you talk about implied\nlicense.\nI would say, why does it make that much\ndifference? What we're talking about here is whether\nafter those pedals are sold to me under an agreement\nthat the patent -- you know, you have a right to sell\nthem to me -- why can't I look at this as saying that\npatent is exhausted, the patent on the pedals and the\npatent for those bicycles insofar as that patent for the\nbicycles says I have a patent on inserting the pedal\ninto a bicycle.\nCall it exhaustion, call it implied license.\nWho cares?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't have any problem with\nyour hypothetical because it's not this case. Your\nhypothetical deals with the situation of what would have\nhappened if you had bought the chip. Would we be in a\nposition to say, even though you bought the chip, we\nnevertheless want to retain some right to come out -- to\ncome after you claiming we still have a patent in that\nchip? And the answer is no. We exhausted -- that was\nexhausted by the sale of the chip.\nThe question is if you buy a pedal, can you\nthen take that pedal that was designed for a bicycle,\nput it into a Stair Master --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah, but I thought --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- patent in the Stair\nMaster --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Of course, I think\nthe answer to that is no, probably no, but, but, but,\nbut. Now you can clarify this because I may be off on a\nwrong track. I thought we're talking about using the\nsold item in those mechanisms which account for\nvirtually almost the only logical use of the sold item.\nThus, if you took the bicycle blanks -- not the bicycle\nblanks; they are eyeglass blanks. I'm mixed up between\nbicycles and eyeglasses, there we are.\nBut if you took the eyeglass blanks and you\nuse them for the purpose of growing plants instead of\ninserting them into eyeglasses, I guess we'd have had a\ndifferent case.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I take it here they are\nusing those chips in those mechanisms that the chips are\nalmost exclusively designed for and there isn't much\nelse to use them for. Am I right or wrong?\nMR. PHILLIPS: That is true. But the -- but\nthe point here is that that's not the relevant\ndistinction. It's not whether or not this is in some\nsense an essential use. What this Court said in Univis\nis that this would be a very -- that would have been a\nvery different case if there had been a separate patent\non the grinding and finishing of those lenses. And that\nis precisely our case. There is a separate patent when\nyou take those components and you then put them into our\nseparate system.\nAnd from my perspective, Your Honor, the\nbetter way to analyze this is not as a question of\nexhaustion. Let's keep the exhaustion doctrine where it\nfits. It's a first sale component. You buy it, you\nexhaust. Let's use the implied licensing as the\nmechanism for dealing with related patents.\nBut the beauty of that in this case,\nobviously, is that -- is that the implied license in\nthis case the courts below have flatly said doesn't\nexist. And it goes to the point that you made, Justice\nBreyer, as well when you said, you know, I buy this and\nI sort of assume that I'm going to be able to use it in\na particular way. These -- this is a $10 billion\ncompany that at the time they bought these components,\nthese chips, received explicit and specific notice that\nthe one thing they could not do was use these chips to\nbuild new systems and then sell those systems,\nobviously, beyond -- you know, under a completely\nseparate patent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Phillips.\nMR. PHILLIPS: So it's not as though they\ndidn't know what they were getting when they bought it.\nThey bought cheap chips and turned them into $2,000\nlaptops because they didn't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Phillips?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What in the world\ndoes clause 3.8 of the license mean? It says,\n\"notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this\nagreement, the parties agree that nothing herein shall\nin any way limit or alter the effect of patent\nexhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party\nhereto sells any of its licensed products.\"\nIn other words, the patent exhaustion\ndoctrine may not apply for all the reasons that we've\nbeen talking about, but it applies in the way it would\napply if we just sold these licensed products. That\nseems to me to give away everything you're talking\nabout.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. Because that -- that\ndepends on the scope of the patent exhaustion doctrine.\nIf the patent exhaustion doctrine is limited to the sale\nof the specific product -- let's for instance assume for\na moment that what in fact happened was that Intel sold\nthe system, rather than the chips. Then that would --\nthat would exhaust the patent doctrine.\nNow, you know, the question is -- and here\nthere is a disconnect in some respects between the\nMallinckrodt decision in the Federal Circuit and some of\nthis Court's previous decisions on to the extent to\nwhich you can condition a sale, and I think in some ways\nthat language may have been given up what rights we\nmight have been able to assert under Mallinckrodt on a\nsomewhat broader basis. But I don't think it can be\nread any further than that, and it certainly -- and the\nkey to this is it certainly doesn't in any way waive our\nrights, you know, as an implied license matter, because\nthat's -- specifically what both the district court and\nthe court of appeals held is there is no implied license\nin this particular context, and so therefore for them to\nprevail they have to expand the patent exhaustion\ndoctrine or the first sale doctrine beyond the first\nsale; and that I submit to you is something that's\nsimply not appropriate.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct in\nunderstanding that you do not defend the Mallinckrodt\ndecision?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I do not defend the\nMallinckrodt decision, Justice Stevens, and clearly I\ndon't believe I have to. All I need to do is have this\nCourt recognize that the central limiting feature of\nUnivis was the fact that it was all one patent and that\nall you were doing was fulfilling the rights that had\nbeen provided for you in that single patent, and that\nthat that's fundamentally -- and that the Court\nrecognized that if there were a separate patent involved\nand you were trying to enforce those rights, that would\nbe a completely different matter.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand you also do\nnot challenge the proposition that the sale by the\nlicensee in this case should be treated as a first sale.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, the chip.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely. There's no\nquestion about that. We have never challenged that, and\nI think the point I made earlier is also valid. We\ndidn't challenge their use, their otherwise infringement\nof our system until we gave them notice; and at that\npoint we said there is no implied license, because I do\nthink, Mr. Chief Justice, it's a fair point, and it's\nthe same point Justice Breyer made, which is, look, if\nyou buy something and you think this is your normal\nassumption that you're going to use it in a particular\nway, that ought to be protected. I think that's\nordinary kind of contract expectation rules. But the\npoint here is that the language of this notice could not\nhave been plainer to anyone --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, now if it should\nbe protected -- and here I'm not sure I'm understanding\nit, so correct me. Let's suppose we have this contract.\nSo everything is identical except we've got my bicycle\nexample in here because I'm more comfortable with that.\nI know how to ride a bicycle and I don't know how to\nwork the chips. So what I do --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Me too.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you see the analogy I'm\nmaking.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what I do I go to the\nshop and I buy this, this mechanism with the pedals on\nit, and then I insert it in my bicycle. Now, actually I\nneed help in doing that, but I do it. Okay. Now I\nstart pedaling off, and now what is it for all these\nthings here that would stop that original inventor from\ncatching me and hauling me into court, and say, what\nyou've done, Breyer, is you've put my -- my mechanism\nhere in this bicycle and I happen to have a patent on\nthe system. And now you start talking to me about,\nwell, the patent was exhausted on the bicycle --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Pedal.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- pedals, but not on the\nsystem.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you agree that\nshouldn't happen.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if I follow you and I\nwrite an opinion just for you, what stops it from\nhappening?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, in that -- in that\nparticular context, in the absence of relatively clear\nnotice, I think it would be quite reasonable to\npotentially find that there was an implied license to\nuse it under those circumstances.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then why isn't it in your\ncase?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm sorry. No. I didn't\nmean to interrupt you. It's your --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why doesn't it mean that?\nWhy isn't it in your case equally?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because the courts below\nspecifically analyzed whether there was -- -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You mean that they just got\nit all wrong? You mean it should be that they got it\nwrong?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, no. They got it right\nbecause there was very specific and explicit notice\nprovided to the purchaser at the time of the purchase\nthat, while this clearly gives you the right to use this\nparticular product, what it doesn't give you the right\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, so if I go in the\nbicycle shop, I go in the bicycle shop and I buy the\npedals and then they give me, you know, one of these\npieces of paper that has all of the 42,000 words on it\nand there in these 42,000 words it says, and now you are\nput on notice that once you put it in your bicycle and\nyou pedal away, they're going to get you and you're\ngoing to be hauled into Patent Court, then -- then\nthat's okay?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, Justice Breyer, we can\nquarrel about sort of the nature of the notice and what\nnotice is adequate to do that, but the basic point here,\nwhich I think is indisputable, is that, one, the notice\nhere is quite clear. It's one page. It's very\nspecific. These are very sophisticated parties and they\nunderstood that they were not obtaining an implied\nlicense by purchasing the chips rather than going out\nand purchasing the systems.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But assuming a\nsimple notice, the answer to his bicycle hypo is yes,\nthey can chase me down the road.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, to be sure. If I have\nseparate patent on the bicycle, I'm entitled to stop\npeople from using that particular bicycle. Now,\ngenerally speaking, to be sure, you don't go after the\nconsumers because most people who are in the business of\nmanufacturing don't develop a really good following by\nsuing their ultimate consumers. So what you do is you\nfind the people who are in the middle, the middle spot,\nwho are actually doing the manufacturing and who are in\nfact violating the patent, and that's who you go after.\nAnd in this context --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's other --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Precisely -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is the reason that there's\nno implied license here, one, because you got the\nnotice, or two, because the component has uses in other\nkinds of methods than the patented method?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think the better answer is\none, because they had clear notice.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You think the notice on\nthat to defeat the implied --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. I think there is an\nargument as to whether there might be non-infringing\nuses. We disagree about that. But I think the better\nargument is one.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The court below did not\nrely on the fact that there might be non-infringing\nuses, did it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. The court below did not\nrely on that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It relied on the notice.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, right. Well, I mean,\nthe court of appeals had a much -- it was a much easier\ncase, frankly --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to be kind of an\nunusual answer to the implied license argument, because\nnormally it doesn't depend on what the patentee decides\nto say somewhere down - down the line. That's kind of\nan unusual reason for not finding an implied license, I\nthink.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean I think the\ndistrict court just said, look, that -- you know,\nordinarily you would say, if you're buying something\nwith the understanding that you're going to -- that its\nprimary or maybe exclusive use will be in a particular\nway, that that would be a reasonable implied -- you\ncould imply a license by those facts alone. Then the\nquestion is whether or not that implication has in some\nsense been clearly overridden by the conduct of the\nparties under the circumstances.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it's subsequent\nconduct. If the implied license occurred, it didn't\noccur at the time of the sale; and it couldn't be -- it\ncouldn't be negated at the time of the sale. If it\noccurred, it occurred at the time of the license, right,\nfrom the patentee of the patent at stake.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. And once he received\n-- and once the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And there was no such\nnotice there. There was no such statement there that\nthis does not -- you don't have the right to sell this\nfor its normal uses?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, but every -- every sale\nafter --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but the horse is out\nof the barn.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, no, but that just means\nthat the patent --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- I mean if both\nparties -- if both parties agree to that notice, I guess\nthat would be something else. Did both parties agree to\nthat notice?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, you mean both Intel and\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, yes. Both Intel and --\nand Quanta clearly agreed -- I mean, both Intel and and\nLG clearly agreed to that, if that's what you're asking\nabout. But the -- but the point here is that the notice\nwas prior to the sale.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that -- that\ndoesn't matter to me. What matters to me is whether it\nwas prior to the license. If there was an implied\nlicense here, it occurred at the time that the --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Of the sale.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. No.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, when else -- an implied\nlicense clearly can't extend to the ultimate purchaser\nuntil the ultimate purchaser gives something.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You give the licensee --\nyou implicitly give the licensee the right to permit the\npeople to whom he sells the product to use the license.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it's given to the\nlicensee surely.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But we clearly didn't do\nthat. That -- I mean that -- the two court rulings\nclearly resolved that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unless it's implicit,\nunless it's implicit when you sell a -- a bicycle pedal\nthat can only be used in bicycles.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. But if I say at the\ntime, but you cannot use it in a bicycle because it has\na separate patent, and therefore\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did you say that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, that's exactly what the\nnotice says.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what the\nnotice says.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the notice. That's\nlater. That's downstream. That's after the license.\nThat's at the time of the sale.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But that goes to clear -- I\nmean, but that goes to the clear understanding -- I mean\nthe question is -- if the question is did Intel have the\nright to sell the system as a system, the answer is yes.\nIt was licensed to do that. But it didn't sell the\nsystem as a system. It sold the components of the\nsystem. And then the question is, does it have as a\nconsequence of that some kind of an implied license to\ndo this? And the courts below both specifically held\nno.\nAnd I think the other thing about this,\nJustice Scalia, is that this was not an issue in this\ncase. Both courts below held that that's not the\nquestion presented. In order for the Petitioner in this\ncase to prevail, they have to demonstrate that this is\nan exhaustion concept.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, because they're saying\n--\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's the question presented\nin the petition.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They're saying the reason\nthey have done so is that the following distinction is\nsignificant. There's a distinction between a license\nthat says you can't sell this unless certain conditions\nare satisfied and, on the other hand, a license that\nsays you can sell this, but if you sell it to a buyer\nwho is described by conditions A and B, you've got to\ntell the buyer that we're going to make a claim against\nA and B. And the ones -- in the first example, there is\na limit to the right to sell. In the second example,\nthere is no limit on the right to sell, but there's a\nwarning about what we're going to do if you do sell\nunder certain conditions. And I think they're saying\nthat unless you have a contract of the former sort which\nlimits your right to sell, then when you do sell,\nexhaustion applies and whatever you may do against the\nultimate buyer is -- is a contract problem or what-not,\nbut it's not -- it's not a matter of patent.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, and the problem --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Number one, do you think I\nam being correct in characterizing, describing the\ndistinction they make?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think so.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And B, if I am, why isn't\nthat distinction an answer to your argument?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because, because it ignores\nthe fact that there are separate patents involved in\nthis case. There is no question that -- there is an\nissue. I mean I don't think there's a question that --\nyou know, as to how far you can go down the road in\ntrying to condition a particular sale. I thought this\nCourt may have resolved this already. Mallinckrodt\nleaves that issue open, but that's not -- that's not the\nquestion.\nThe issue here is if I sell to you, Justice\nSouter, a particular chip, whether I condition it or\nnot, I think that's -- to me that's unenforceable. But\nthe question is, can you then take that chip and use it\nto violate a separate patent? And the reason you know\nthat it's not exhaustion --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. I understand where\nyou're going. So then what you're saying, I guess, is\nthat the real issue does not involve this distinction\nbetween a --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- a limited right and a\nright --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- to go after people\nlater.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's not the issue in this\ncase.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What it -- what it involves\nis the statement that they make that if you license the\nmanufacture, use, and sale of a particular component and\nthat particular component has only one reasonable use --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- then you have\nnecessarily licensed them to sell with that ultimate use\nin mind, and when you do -- when you license them to\nsell, the patent-exhaustion doctrine attaches to any\npatent right that you may have, whether you call it\nsystem --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- or whether you call it\ncomponent.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And you are saying that\nargument is no good because that, in fact, is an implied\nlicense argument, and there were findings that there was\nno implied license.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So I understand your\nposition.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That is correct, Justice\nSouter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. PHILLIPS: And let me further --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then explain -- now this\nyou might know because it's just following up on what\nJustice Souter said better than I did. I think from\nthese briefs I've gotten the impression that at least\nsome people think that where you invent a component,\nsay, like the bicycle pedals, and it really has only one\nuse, which is to go into a bicycle, it's the easiest\nthing in the world to get a patent not just on that\ncomponent but to also get a patent on the system, which\nis called handlebars, body, and pedals.\nAnd since that's just a drafting question,\nall that we would do by finding in your favor is to\ndestroy the exhaustion doctrine, because all that would\nhappen, if it hasn't happened already, is these\nbrilliant patent lawyers, and they don't even -- they\ncan be great patent lawyers, not just fine lawyers, and\njust draft it the way I said and that's the end of the\nexhaustion doctrine. And that's why it is preferable to\nsay it is exhausted. What is exhausted? One, the\npatent on this component and, two, the patent on any\nsystem involving this component where that system is the\nonly reasonable use of the component, rather than using\nthe terminology \"implied license.\"\nNow, I think that's an argument that's being\nmade in some of these briefs, and if so I'd like to you\nreply.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think that clearly\nunderstates the role of the PTO in granting a separate\npatent. I mean, this is not -- these are not things you\npick up at the corner drugstore. You have to justify\nthem. And if you look at Section 282, \"a patent shall\nbe presumed valid,\" each claim shall be presumed valid\nindependently of the validity of other claims. And\nthere's an independence that's embedded in this entire\nscheme. If it's true that the PTO has in fact granted\npatent rights on something that's fundamentally not\ndifferent from the other -- from some other patent, the\nsolution to that is a validity challenge. And candidly,\nI think that's exactly what all of those arguments are\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- is patent validity\nchallenges.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That argument didn't\nprevail last year in the KSR case, right? I mean, we're\n-- we've had experience with the Patent Office where it\ntends to grant patents a lot more liberally than we\nwould enforce under the patent law.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but all -- I'm not --\nI'm not particularly criticizing the PTO. What I'm\nsaying is that the statutory scheme presumes that there\nis a separateness when a patent is issued and, therefore\n-- and which is why -- again, the first -- there's no\nreason to go to an expansion of the first-sale doctrine\nin order to deal with the kinds of problems you have\nhere because in general -- in general you can deal with\nit as a matter of implied license, but that issue has\nbeen resolved adverse to the other side in this case,\nand there's no reason to sort of fill in that void.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Phillips, when you say\nthat was resolved adversely, you say there was a finding\nof no implied license.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was that a finding of no\nimplied license from LGE to Intel or no implied license\nfrom Intel to the buyers?\nMR. PHILLIPS: From Intel to the buyers.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Phillips --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the crucial -- is\nthat the crucial step?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. That's -- that's the\ncritical component of this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If that --\nMR. PHILLIPS: The buyer would have to\nassert exhaustion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If that was an implied\nlicense from LGE to Intel, then Intel would have\nauthority to sell -- to sell these things for their --\nfor their use.\nMR. PHILLIPS: To be sure, Intel has the\nauthority to sell these things, and it has the authority\nto sell -- it depends on what the things are. It has\nthe authority to sell the chips. It has the authority\nto sell the systems, but what it doesn't have the\nauthority to do is to allow somebody downstream to take\nthe chips and put them into the separately patented\nsystems, and the -- and the people downstream know that\nthey don't have that entitlement.\nJustice Souter, to me the patent-exhaustion\ndoctrine is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think the exhaustion, if\nIntel got -- if Intel got -- I'm sorry. Yes, if Intel\ngot an implied license to the system from LGE when it\nsold those products, it seems to me the exhaustion\ndoctrine would take hold and would -- would apply to\nthat implied license just as it applied to the -- to the\nlicense of the chips.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think the answer to that is\nit shouldn't, that the exhaustion doctrine should be\nretained as a first-sale doctrine alone. That's the way\nit's always been understood for 150 years. And to\nexpand it this way is to undermine the rights of -- in\nthe separate patents.\nAnd now I'll try to make the point I wanted\nto make to Justice Souter. Read the reply brief: A\nsale authorized by one patentee does not exhaust patents\nheld by a different patentee. So we wouldn't even be in\nthis case if it turned out that we didn't just -- we\ndidn't happen to have all of these rights in the first\nplace. I mean, if they bought the chips and if Wang had\nheld on to some portion of the system patent in this\ncase, there is no question that Wang would have the full\nopportunity -- that sale didn't exhaust their rights in\nthat patent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the way you\nachieve that result is to condition the sale. What\nyou're trying to do is expand what you get under a\ncondition to what you get under a notice. And the\nreason that troubles me is because if you had imposed a\ncondition on the sale, Intel wouldn't have paid you as\nmuch for it. But you say, all right, we'll take the\nmoney because -- additional money because there's no\ncondition, but we want to achieve the same result\nbecause of the notice.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean there can't -- there's\nno serious basis for doubting what Intel knew precisely\nwhat it was getting in this. It was getting peace on\nboth sides of the aisle in terms of litigation, and it\nknew that there were separate patents here and that when\nit sold the chips it would certainly be entitled to\nassume that there would be exhaustion. That's the\nprovision you read. But when it sells the chips, it\ndidn't know and it specifically gave notice that it\nrecognized that that doesn't remotely say what the right\nanswer is with respect to the systems and with respect\nto the methods. And that to me, Mr. Chief Justice, is\nthe fundamental distinction.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they're happy\nwith that because the notice says you can't -- you can\nonly use this with Intel products. So they're happy\nwith that solution as well.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, that's part of the\nreason why it was negotiated in that way. But I mean\nthat is -- so far as I know, there is no particular\nissue by reference to that particular limitation.\nThe reality is if we entered into the same\nagreement with AMD, which is one of the other\nchipmakers, I am sure they would ask for the same\nrestriction on it: That you could only do it with AMD\nproducts, as well. I mean that doesn't have anything to\ndo with the nature of the underlying problem that we are\nconfronting in this particular context.\nIt seems to me the fundamental issue here is\nthey have a limited right when they purchase that\nproduct. They didn't get the right to make other\nproducts. They didn't get the right to breach or\ninfringe a completely separate patent. And that is the\nbasis on which the judgment of the Court of Appeals,\nwhich is all that is before the Court, should be\naffirmed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Before you sit down, to\nwhat extent do you think the Court of Appeals has\nalready adopted your theory of the case?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean they recognized\nspecifically that these are completely separate. That\nthe claims that are at issue here are different from the\namounts that were -- from the products that were, in\nfact, purchased. So the elements, the constituent\nelements, they have clearly embraced. The conclusion,\nthey have clearly not embraced.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They did not get your\ntheory of the case out of my reading of their opinion.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, my --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the difference\nbetween \"conditional sale\" and \"limited sale\" -- you are\nsaying they used the word \"conditional.\" You are saying\nit was a \"limited sale\" that only -- a \"limited\nlicense.\" It only licensed Patents A and B and not\nPatents C and D.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, what I was actually\nsaying is that if you read the language in 4a and 5a\nwhere it says: The patents asserted by LGE do not cover\nthe products licensed to, or sold by, Intel. They have\nto be combined with additional components. And then in\n5a they say: Notably, the sale involved a component of\nthe inserted, patented invention, not the entire\npatented system.\nSo they recognize, to my mind, what are the\npredicate factual bases from which I say the \"exhaustion\ndoctrine\" shouldn't have been -- shouldn't have been\ntriggered. But, to be sure, they -- they -- it was a\nmuch easier task for them because they -- as far as they\nare concerned, all kinds of conditions are permissible.\nAnd we don't need that in order to win this case. I'm\nnot asking the Court to embrace that particular\napproach.\nIf there are no other questions, I would ask\nyou to affirm the decision.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Phillips. Ms. Mahoney, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. MAHONEY: I'd like to start by\nemphasizing what counsel did not say. He never said\nthat Intel lacked the authority under the system and\nmethod patents to sell these components. He never said\nthat. In fact, he said that Intel was released. Why\nwere they released? This would have been contributory\ninfringement, otherwise.\nThe reason they were released was because\nthey had the authority under this license to sell these\ncomponents under the system patent. And that's what the\nFederal Circuit acknowledged, and that's what the\ndistrict court recognized, and it's never been in\ndispute.\nTheir position is simply that, despite that,\ndespite express authority to sell these under that\npatent -- not just under some other patent, under the\npatents at issue here -- that they can enforce\nconditions on post-sale use. And that's what this Court\nhas never allowed.\nUnivis is on all fours. They say, well,\nthat just involved a single patent. Well, as far as\nthis case is concerned, it just involves a single\npatent, too. The whole issue here is whether or not\nQuanta's taking of the components and combining them\nwith some generic things like wires and memory\nnecessarily infringed under LGE's allegations.\nAnd the district court found that they\nwould, and that's not in dispute. And what that means\nis that, just as in Univis where you had -- the court\nfinds there were really two products there. It finds\nthere were two different commodities, the lens blank and\nthe finished lens.\nIt says under Miller, the Miller/Tydings\nAct, these are two different commodities, and the patent\nwas only on the finished lens. But, in order to make\nthat finished lens, you had to -- you had to make a lens\nblank that would embody many of the limitations of the\nclaim. That's exactly what the district court found\nhappened here.\nFor this, when Intel manufactured these\nchips, the microprocessors and the chipsets, it\nmanufactured them in a way that embodied many of the\nlimitations of the system and method patents that are at\nissue here. So, as in the language of Univis, there\nthey said, well, we are dealing with a product that is\nbeing manufactured in multiple stages.\nAnd during that first stage, while it's true\nit wasn't -- it didn't directly infringe because the\nlens blank wasn't the patented product, they,\nnevertheless, practiced the patent in part. Why?\nBecause they -- they -- some of the -- while\nmanufacturing it, they have met some of the limitations\nof the claim.\nAnd they said when that lens blank was sold,\nthat it exhausted the rights of the patent owner to\nenforce any conditions, any type of conditions on use or\nresale after that sale. And it didn't have to rely on\nimplied license because of the exhaustion doctrine.\nOnce there is an authorized sale of a product that is\nprotected by the patent that covered that final finished\nproduct, exhaustion is triggered.\nThat's exactly what we have here. And they\nsaid, oh, but you could disclaim that with an agreement.\nWell, in Univis there was an agreement. The\npurchaser of that lens blank specifically agreed by\ncontract that it would only use it in certain ways and\nonly charge certain prices. So they expressly\ndisclaimed, you know, the idea that they were -- that\nthey couldn't use it in those ways. And, nevertheless,\nthis Court found exhaustion.\nWhen the district court found no \"implied\nlicense,\" all the court was saying was, well, under the\nFederal Circuit precedent \"implied license\" is an\n\"equitable doctrine.\"\nI see my time is finished. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\n"
