        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nfirst in Number 01-10873, Khanh Phuong Nguyen versus the\nUnited States and a companion case.\nMr. Green.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GREEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe issue in this case is whether the\nparticipation of a non-Article III judge on an improperly\nconstituted panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\nrenders the decision of that panel void.\nThe parties are in agreement that the\ndesignation of Judge Munson, who sits for a 10-year term\non the Ninth Circuit panel, violated the statute\npertaining to designations. But that statute does more\nwork than simply govern designations. That statute\nprotects the Article III character of the circuit courts\nof appeals by ensuring that only Article III judges are\ndesignated to sit on the Circuit courts of appeals.\nQUESTION: Counsel, may I ask you, in this case, is\nit possible that a quorum of the court would consist of\ntwo members of a three-member panel on the court of\nappeals?\nMR. GREEN: Yes. A properly constituted\nquorum -- or a quorum of a properly constituted panel\ncould -- could be two members. But our objection here,\nJustice O'Connor, is with the participation of a judge\nwho, with all due respect, had no business being there in\nthe first place.\nQUESTION: Right. Even -- even though the panel\nwas unanimous.\nMR. GREEN: Even though the panel was unanimous.\nQUESTION: Now, if -- if we were to agree with\nyou and it went back, could the same two remaining judges\nconstitute a properly arranged panel and decide the case\nagain?\nMR. GREEN:\nPrincipally because the rules that govern quorum call for\na -- a two-member panel rather than a three-member panel\nwhen there's some emergency that's certified or when\nthere's a disqualification or recusal. So I -- I think\nthere --\nQUESTION: The same two could be on a new panel,\nhowever.\nMR. GREEN: I would maintain not in this case\nfor the simple reason that it appears that there has been\nsome participation in the preparation of respondent's\nbrief by the Chief Judge, as well as Judge Goodwin. So we\nwould maintain, given that involvement, it would be best\nto send this back to a newly constituted and\nproperly constituted --\nQUESTION: Is this -- is this a right that can\nbe waived? No objection was made to this.\nMR. GREEN: It is a right that can be waived,\nJustice O'Connor. There's -- there -- that's -- that I\nthink is beyond peradventure. But I don't think there was\nwaiver here because there's no record evidence that\nindicates that there was a waiver. This Court in New York\nv. Hill, for example, found a waiver --\nQUESTION: There was no objection.\nQUESTION: I'm surprised you say that there can\nbe a waiver.\nout to its litigants a waiver notice waiving participation\nof non-Article III personnel and there would be no\nstructural objection? I -- I thought --\nMR. GREEN: Well, I think --\nQUESTION: I thought the whole point of -- of\nyour -- of your error analysis is this affects the\nstructural integrity of the court and it can't be waived.\nMR. GREEN: Well, the additional point I was\ngoing to make in response to Justice O'Connor's question\nis that, in fact, even though there may be consent or even\nthough there may be waiver, that has not stopped this\nCourt from considering these important structural\nlimitations in the past.\nQUESTION: Well, but what -- what is your\nposition? Can the right be waived or not? I mean, if --\nif you say the right can be waived, then it's just a\nquestion of whether or not they knew or should have known\nor something like that.\nMR. GREEN: I think that the decision is void,\nand so the position -- the position would be that although\nall Article III provisions can be waived, in this instance\nbecause of the nature of the structural error, the consent\nor the waiver would not matter at all.\nQUESTION: Well, then -- then your -- counsel\ncould have appeared in the Ninth Circuit fully aware that\nJudge Munson was sitting, go all the way through the\nargument and the briefing, never mentioning a word about\nit, and still the counsel would have the ability to void\nthe thing later.\nMR. GREEN: I -- I think that's -- that's\ncorrect. I think that would be the necessary consequence.\nQUESTION: And not to void if he -- if he won.\nRight?\nQUESTION: And not to void it if he won.\nQUESTION: That's a nice position to be in. You\njust sit there, don't make any objection. If you win the\ncase, everything is fine, and if you lose the case, you\nplay dog in the manger and -- and come up here and say,\noop, this was an improper panel. That doesn't sound to me\nthe -- the -- like the way the system ought to work.\nMR. GREEN: But, Justice Scalia, I think that\nrelies upon counsel in that situation being confident that\nthis Court would grant a writ of certiorari. I -- I\nthink that that kind of gamesmanship is really quite\nfar-fetched. This Court does not sit as a court of\nerrors. So even though I as counsel know that that might\nbe error below, I would still have to -- I would have to\nbe relying on the -- the equivalent of legal lightning\nstriking, so to speak, in order to -- to be certain that\nthat error would be corrected.\nQUESTION: Mr. Green, how does Article III --\nhow can Article III be claimed by your client who was\ntried not before an Article III court, before a\nterritorial court -- your client has no entitlement to an\nArticle III court. So this seems -- you're addressing an\nabstract question about the proper composition of a Ninth\nCircuit panel. Yet, your litigant, your client has no\nentitlement to an Article III tribunal either at trial or\non appeal. So I think that there's a serious problem of\nwhether your clients are positioned to raise the proper\ncomposition of an Article III court when they are not even\nentitled to an Article III court.\nMR. GREEN: That is true as a general matter at\nthe trial court stage. However, it -- it's very much our\nposition here -- and I would disagree with the premise\nonly insofar as you said as to the court of appeals.\nCongress vested jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.,\nsection 1291, over appeals from the territories in the\nUnited States Circuit Court of Appeals.\nQUESTION: Yes, but it didn't have to. In other\nwords, a case -- an Article III -- a case in which\nlitigants are entitled to an Article III tribunal then\nmust go to an Article III court. Here Congress did\ndesignate the Ninth Circuit to hear these appeals from\nnon-Article III trial courts.\nCongress didn't have to do that with respect to your\nclients. Congress could have given them an Article IV\nappellate tribunal and that would have been okay.\nMR. GREEN: No. I -- When Congress vests\njurisdiction in the United States courts of appeals, it\ndoes so not only to its -- in accordance not only with its\nplenary power over the territories under Article IV, but\nalso pursuant to Article III. When Congress creates any\ninferior court and creates a jurisdiction in those courts,\nwe would maintain that -- that Congress is acting pursuant\nto Article III. And in this instance --\nQUESTION: But when Congress created the\ndistrict court for the Northern Marianas, for Guam, what\nauthority was it exercising?\nMR. GREEN: It was -- it was exercising its\nplenary authority pursuant to Article IV.\nQUESTION: I -- I assume you've got a -- maybe\nI'm wrong, but I assume you've got a fall-back and that\nis, okay, if you don't accept -- we don't accept the\nconstitutional position, you're still claiming that you\nhave a legal entitlement to the Ninth Circuit and, hence,\nto a completely Article III court.\nMR. GREEN: That -- that's exactly correct.\nQUESTION: And that could be true if Congress\nwas acting under -- under Article IV.\nMR. GREEN: That -- that's correct. Even if\nCongress was acting under Article IV, the statute plainly\nvests jurisdiction, and it -- and it provides for\nindependent -- independent review of these appeals by an\nArticle III court.\nTo -- to -- as respondent suggests, to -- to\nargue that a panel of the court of appeals could be\nspecially constituted for these appeals would rewrite\nsection 1291. Section 1291 says in very plain terms that\njurisdiction shall vest in the court of appeals.\nQUESTION: Mr. Green, suppose -- suppose I\ndisagree with you that -- that you -- you can sit through\na trial and not object with -- with impunity, and -- and I\nthink that you lose here unless you can show plain error\nand the usual requirements for avoiding the rule about --\nabout contemporaneous objection. Why do you come within\nthe plain error requirements and, in particular, the\nrequirement that -- that there have -- that -- that the\nmistake seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings? Why -- why is\nthat the case?\nYou acknowledge that your client could have been\ntried by non-Article III judges. You acknowledge that the\njudge who sat, although he was non-Article III, was a\nFederal judge properly appointed.\nyour client. So how can I say that this -- that the\nproceeding -- yes, there was a -- there was a mistake, but\ndid -- was it -- was it a mistake that seriously affected\nthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the\nproceeding? I -- I just don't see that.\nMR. GREEN: In the following senses, Justice\nScalia, it did affect it.\nFirst of all, with respect to fairness, the\nNinth Circuit is -- is a court of fully independent\nreview, and I would maintain that precisely because the\npetitioners here were tried by an Article IV court, it\nmakes sense, and it may actually be constitutionally\nrequired that in some sense their -- their appellate\nreview is had by an Article III court.\nBut in any event, Congress statutorily vested\njurisdiction in a fully independent Article III court, and\nas a result of doing so, to put Judge Munson who sits for\na 10-year term on a panel as a co-equal participant would\naffect the fairness of the court. We have a unique --\nQUESTION: Suppose the panel had included a\njudge who was holding a recess appointment, a Federal\njudge who was appointed on a recess basis and therefore at\nthat point didn't have secure tenure?\nMR. GREEN: I -- I think there would be issues\nof -- of qualification there, and there might even be --\nwhere a -- a recess appointment was -- was held in a -- in\na qualified sense, then I would say that was an\nArticle III -- an Article III qualification for an\nArticle III court potentially. If there were issues as\nto the qualification, we might be in the realm of the\nde facto officer doctrine.\nQUESTION: But Justice Scalia's question, at\nleast as I understood it, I think meant for you to\nconcentrate on why -- why this would bring the\nadministration of justice into disrepute, so to speak.\nMR. GREEN: Well --\nQUESTION: You -- you make your argument that\nthis was improper, what was done, and the Government\nagrees. But there's an additional requirement here under\nplain error.\nMR. GREEN: Yes, and -- and I would add to my\nresponse to Justice Scalia that we have an amicus brief\nhere from Judge Moore who sits in precisely the same seat,\nso to speak, that Judge Munson sits as a territorial judge\nin the Virgin Islands. The amicus brief of Judge Moore\npoints out very plainly that he views himself as open to\nquestion with regard to his impartiality because he is\nsubject to the hostile treatment -- to use Justice\nDouglas' phraseology, the hostile treatment of the press\nand the -- and the glowering disfavor of those who have in\ntheir hands the power of reappointment.\nQUESTION: Gee, he -- he should resign if he\nfeels that way, it seems to me.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. GREEN: He wants -- he -- he prefers that\nyou convert him to an Article III judge, so --\n[Laughter.]\nQUESTION: I'm sure he does. I'm sure he does.\nQUESTION: I mean, you -- you have a -- a\nstatutory argument.\nMR. GREEN: Yes.\nQUESTION: And you have a constitutional\nargument.\nMR. GREEN: Yes.\nQUESTION: All right. Let's assume away the\nstatutory argument for the moment. There you have the\nproblem -- you're -- you're right that it's contrary to\nthe statute, but maybe it isn't plain error. I'm focusing\nonly on the constitutional argument, and from the point of\nview of the constitutional argument, I would like you to\nassume the statute says the opposite. The statute says\nthat this judge can sit.\nAll right. So purposes of a constitutional\nargument, why can't your party waive -- why can't your\nclients have waived that?\nwe're just considering a case in which -- a different case\nin which it's at least arguable -- there are two sides to\nthe argument -- whether two parties can get together and\nhave a magistrate, who is not an Article III judge, try\ntheir case. The consent simply consisting of the fact\nthey went ahead without objection. In that case, there's\nthe statute, but for present purposes, we're assuming the\nopposite statute.\nSo I mean, if it's at least arguable that you\ncould have consent, shown only by the fact they went ahead\nto a trial before a magistrate and that would be enough to\nvalidate constitutionally the magistrate trying the case,\nwhy isn't the fact that you went ahead here\nconstitutionally sufficient to show that you agreed to the\ntrial before -- the -- the appeal that included one judge\nfrom Guam?\nMR. GREEN: Because this Court has -- has said\nthat the claims of structural validity, claims that go to\nthe very validity of the tribunal itself, are claims which\ninvoke institutional interests, not just personal\ninterests --\nQUESTION: Now, I understand that, but my\nquestion is, how is that any more true or less true where\nwhat they've done is consent through behavior to trial of\na case before a magistrate?\nMR. GREEN: Well, this Court has never -- this\nCourt has never addressed the question of whether you can\nhave --\nQUESTION: You think that magistrate trials --\nMR. GREEN: -- a trial --\nQUESTION: -- through consent are\nunconstitutional?\nMR. GREEN: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: No, no. Sorry. I didn't mean to\ninterrupt you. I jumped ahead to -- thinking what you\nwere going to say before listening to what you were going\nto say.\n[Laughter.]\nQUESTION: And I want to hear what you're going\nto say.\nMR. GREEN: I do that sometimes too.\nQUESTION: My fault.\nMR. GREEN: The Court has -- the Court has never\nbefore held that it would be permissible for a -- or for a\nmagistrate to conduct a full trial. And that I would\nmaintain because that also might affect institutional\ninterests could also not be subject to waiver or consent.\nQUESTION: So are you saying --\nMR. GREEN: That's -- that argument is\ncertainly --\nQUESTION: -- if we agree with you then, if we\nagree with you that consent through behavior is not good\nenough constitutionally, we would also be saying it is\nunconstitutional to have consent to a trial before a\nmagistrate. You see, that's quite a -- a -- if you're\ngoing to say yes to that, that's a problem.\nMR. GREEN: No, I -- I understand that. But\nagain, I'm -- I'm going to go to the dividing line between\nArticle III interests and Appointments Clause interests\nand those structural limitations and structural\nprotections in the court system which are not quite the\nsame as the kind of structural trial errors that this\nCourt has addressed in -- in Gomez, that this Court\naddressed last term in Cotton. Those really are errors\nthat go to the validity of the claim, not necessarily to\nthe validity of the -- or to the very validity of the\ninstitutional interests.\nI think the hypothetical that you posit is\nactually Glidden, and in Glidden, this Court held that\neven where the designation of the judges from the Court of\nClaims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals was\nlawful in that sense, the Court took pains to look and see\nwhether the courts from which those judges were designated\nwere Article III courts.\nQUESTION:\nno -- no opinion for the Court in that case.\nMR. GREEN: No, there wasn't, but the Chief\nJustice and Justice Clark in that case concurred in the\nresult, and the difference that they had with the majority\nwas that they didn't think that Bakelite and Williams\nshould be deemed overruled, only that they had been\nsuperseded by subsequent events, including the grant of\nlifetime tenure to the judges on the Court of Claims and\nto the -- to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.\nQUESTION: But they -- they didn't join the\nopinion, did they, of Justice --\nMR. GREEN: No. No, they did not. But I -- I\nwould maintain that there was a -- a majority of five on a\nseven-member Court because two of the Justices had recused\nthemselves. A majority of five.\nQUESTION: In the Government's brief, they\nmention a conversation with the Chief Judge of the Ninth\nCircuit by a former lawyer for your client. I'm curious\nto know, A, whether you disagree with what is said, and B,\nhow did they get in -- how does that get before us?\nMR. GREEN: I can't answer the second question.\nTo be frank, I'd like to know the answer to the second\nquestion as well.\nBut as to the first question, I really would\nstart with the proposition that I don't think it matters.\nI -- I don't think it matters here. The conversation,\neven as reported by respondents, would not in -- in my\nmind and in our position constitute a waiver or consent.\nThe issue of who hears your appeal is probably so\nimportant that it's necessary that that be done somehow in\nthe defendant's presence.\nRespondent relies on Olano. In Olano, the Court\ntook pains to point out that the defendants were present\nwhen the discussions of whether the -- the alternate\njurors could deliberate or not. Here I would say this\nis -- this would be the same sort of issue subject to the\nsame sort of waiver and consent requirements.\nQUESTION: That's odd in a -- in a circuit that\nhas the vast majority of its appeals decided without any\noral argument. You said that the defendant has to be\nthere? Your party has to be there?\nMR. GREEN: I think for -- he doesn't have to be\nthere, but there would have to be some indication on -- on\nthe record, in addition to the conversation that -- that\nrespondents recite, that -- that Petitioner Nguyen\nunderstood that there was -- that -- that she was waiving\nsome important right to a fully independent review by an\nArticle III court.\nAnd I want to stress, as I say that, that --\nthat this claim that respondents make with respect to\nwaiver and consent really affects only one of the\npetitioners here. We have to continue with the -- with\nthe case of Petitioner Phan for whom no oral argument was\nmade.\nQUESTION: But this important right that you --\nyou were relying on, it's her right only because there\nhappens to be a statute that sets up the Ninth Circuit as\nthe appellate forum. You have recognized that she did not\nhave any independent right to that kind of forum. She\ncould have had -- since the court -- the -- the authority\nat trial is determined by Article IV, similarly for\nterritory authority on appeal.\nMR. GREEN: But even if she had only a statutory\nright in that sense, it's -- it is the case that Congress\ncreates jurisdiction and creates the inferior courts\npursuant to Article III under a statute. That doesn't\nmean that constitutional protections and constitutional\nrights don't attend the statutory grants of jurisdiction\nand -- and the activities of the courts that are created\npursuant to Article III.\nThere are numerous examples of -- of pure\nstatutory rights. Let's take, for example, the right to\nappeal. That is merely a statutory right. This Court has\nnot held that that's a constitutional right.\nQUESTION:\ncan be forfeited if you don't assert them at the earliest\ntime when you reasonably could.\nMR. GREEN: That is -- that is true. But\nhere --\nQUESTION: And I'm not using the word waiver.\nIt's not a question of a person consenting, but forfeiting\nby not raising it at the earliest reasonable stage.\nMR. GREEN: That is true, but this Court has\nheld in cases that involve similar Article III issues and\nsimilar issues of the Appointments Clause that -- that\nissues of consent and waiver are not dispositive. A\nfortiori then, I think issues of forfeiture would not be\ndispositive.\nQUESTION: I have one question on the merits I'd\nlike to ask you. Let's assume we get to the merits of a\nconstitutional question. I assume for that purpose that\nthe statute says, the Ninth Circuit shall travel to Guam\nand hear appeals and for purposes of this -- for purposes\nof this voyage to Guam to hear the appeal, the make-up of\nthe panel will be two Article III judges and one Article I\njudge. All right? That's the statute.\nNow, why is that unconstitutional? I cannot --\nit's very unusual, but I cannot think of any due process\nright of any Guam person who would be hurt, and I cannot\nthink of -- why it's wrong to ask an Article III judge to\ntake on this additional adjudicatory function with an\nArticle I judge sitting next to him. It's purely\nadjudicatory. It's not handing out radio licenses. It's\nnot doing anything else that's unsuitable to a judge. Why\nnot? That's the merits of the question, and I'm not\nsaying it has an obvious answer, but I want to hear your\nanswer.\nMR. GREEN: I'm going to give almost the same\nanswer that -- that we would give as to -- as to our\nclaims. It violates the Appointments Clause.\nQUESTION: The Appointments Clause which wasn't\neven raised in the reply brief. I mean, that -- that's --\nor in the cert petition. Is that all? If it's not the\nAppointments -- I'll go look at that. Sorry. I just\nhadn't -- I was -- I was -- thought you were going to say\nsomething about the structural Article III problem.\nMR. GREEN: Well, I'm going -- I'm going to\nthere as well --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. GREEN: -- and -- and say that -- that if\nthe judge was an Article I judge, that -- if that judge\nhad lifetime tenure, then we would be back in the realm of\nGlidden again, trying to decide whether that court was\nactually an Article III court.\nQUESTION: No, no.\nto -- the Ninth Circuit is an Article III court.\nMR. GREEN: Correct.\nQUESTION: My statute says that for purposes of\nhearing an appeal from Guam, two -- the Ninth Circuit\nhears it. The panel shall consist of two Article III\njudges and one Article I judge. Okay? Now, I want to\nknow what in the Constitution forbids that statute. I'm\nnot saying it's obvious one way or the other. I want to\nknow. And it won't help just to say it forbids it. I\nwant to know why it forbids it.\nMR. GREEN: It -- it forbids it because of the\nspecial nature of Article III courts. This Court has\nfrequently noted that Article III courts are independent.\nThey have constitutional independence. They have\nconstitutional salary protection. Article I judges are\nnot independent in the same way.\nQUESTION: But this statute, in effect, says --\nif -- if you take that position, the statute, in effect,\nsays, we don't want an Article III court. Let's -- let's\nconcede that with -- with the one Article I judge sitting\non it, it ceases to be an Article III court. But that --\nthe statute says that. What's the matter with that?\nMR. GREEN: Well, we said in our brief that if\nCongress were acting to -- in accordance with its plenary\npower, which -- as I think Justice Breyer's hypothetical\nposes, that might well be constitutional. I think\nthere --\nQUESTION: So -- so that if Congress said, all\nright, we're going to have appeals from the territorial\ncourts in a court consisting of one territorial judge and\ntwo Article III judges, however selected, no problem with\nthat constitutionally. Right?\nMR. GREEN: I -- I think that is a very\ndifficult and open question, and I -- and I think there\nmight be a constitutional issue if we to back to Crowell\nv. Benson, and -- and Crowell's reaffirmation in -- in\nNorthern -- or rather, Thomas. There is a significant\nissue as to whether you can have territorial judges\nexercising precisely the same kind of almost Article III\njurisprudence that district -- regular Article III\ndistrict judges have and -- and not have some sort of\nArticle III review from that.\nQUESTION: So you -- you would -- you would have\nthe same problem if Congress said we're going to set up an\nArticle IV court of appeals consisting of three Article IV\njudges. You'd have the same problem?\nMR. GREEN: I think that -- that claim can be\nmade, as I say, on the basis of Crowell and -- and on the\nbasis of Thomas.\nQUESTION:\nmean, would you make it? Do you think that is a sound\nclaim?\nMR. GREEN: I think -- I think I would make it\nand I think I would make it for the following reasons.\nPrecisely because, as Justice Ginsburg points out, these\nArticle IV judges, in trying cases and interpreting\nFederal law, are certainly doing the same kinds of work,\nexercising the judicial power --\nQUESTION: Yes, but you could make the same\nargument about trial judges and -- and Article III\ndistrict judges. They're doing the same kind of work.\nThey're subject to the same pressures and the same\nconcerns, and if it's okay for the district court, why\nwouldn't it be okay for an appellate court?\nMR. GREEN: Well, I -- there is certainly\nArticle III review. I'm not sure that -- that Article III\nreview has been constitutionally mandated in that sense.\nBut where there is no Article III protection in the first\nplace with respect to -- to judges who are exercising that\nauthority at the trial court level, Crowell v. Benson and\nI think Thomas indicate that -- that there is a -- there\nis an open question at least as to whether Article III\nreview is mandated. And this Court said the same in\nGuam v. Olsen on -- on precisely the same issue.\nI'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for\nrebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Green.\nMs. Millett, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThere is no dispute in this case that a\nstatutory violation occurred, and there's also no dispute\nthat no challenge was made to that violation below. The\nnarrow question presented is whether these individual\ndefendants are entitled to reversal under the plain error\ndoctrine --\nQUESTION: May I ask you a question at the\noutset? And actually two questions. Some years ago I was\nin London, and I was asked to sit with a British court on\nthe bench. And I -- I didn't do it, but I often thought,\nwell, I wonder if they would have let me participate in\nthe decision.\nSupposing here, instead of the Article I judge,\nyou had a British judge and they asked him to sit. That\nwould be one question. Would that make it a different\ncase? And secondly, what if they asked the President of\nthe -- of the Guam Bar Association to sit as a third\nperson on the panel?\nMS. MILLETT: The -- there certainly would still\nbe a statutory violation in those cases absolutely.\nQUESTION: Yes. The same statutory violation\nyou have here.\nMS. MILLETT: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: And would you just say that's\nharmless error?\nMS. MILLETT: Well, plain error I think is --\nQUESTION: Plain error.\nMS. MILLETT: -- a higher standard. I certainly\nhope someone would object, but if they don't and assuming\nthat it's a case coming out of the territory again, then\nwe would go back to the same analysis and say whether --\ncould Congress create -- if Congress could create a court\nthat consisted of two judges and Guam --\nQUESTION: They could create a court with two\njudges and a British judge.\nMS. MILLETT: -- and a lawyer --\nQUESTION: Let's assume they could do it.\nMS. MILLETT: Yes.\nQUESTION: But with the statute we have now --\nMS. MILLETT: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- what would you do in that case\nthat I asked you?\nMS. MILLETT:\nbe the same as it is here.\nQUESTION: That would be perfectly okay.\nMS. MILLETT: I'm putting aside any sort of due\nprocess concerns that might apply --\nQUESTION: Well, wait.\nQUESTION: Well, that --\nQUESTION: To get -- to get due process, you --\nyou get to -- you get to that portion of the plain error\ndoctrine which says plain error applies if it seriously\naffects the integrity or fairness of the proceeding. And\nif you have the President of the Guam Bar Association\nsitting on the court, doesn't that seriously affect the\nfairness of the proceeding in a manner that -- that having\na -- an Article IV judge does not?\nMS. MILLETT: Well, in American Insurance\nCompany versus Canter, which was opinion by Chief Justice\nMarshall at the beginning of this Nation, dealing with\nterritorial cases, it addressed there a court that\nconsisted of a lawyer and five -- I'm sorry -- a notary\nand five jurors in a territory --\nQUESTION: But that -- but that didn't -- that\nwas not a court which in -- in other parts of its duties\nwas not an Article III court. You're saying that you can\nbecome an -- be an Article III judge one day and Article\nIV judge the other day.\nan Article III court one day, an Article IV court the next\nday. There's simply no authority for that proposition\nthat I know of. Tell me if I'm wrong.\nMS. MILLETT: Justice Kennedy, I think there are\ndifficult constitutional questions that would be raised if\nCongress were to prescribe this. I think based on the\nanalysis in our brief, it is a statute we could defend.\nBut there would be difficult constitutional questions if\nthat happened.\nWhat happened here was a mistake, not a\nconfrontation between the branches with Congress trying to\nchange our --\nQUESTION: Well, but your position is there --\nthere could be a waiver. I thought your answer to Justice\nStevens was that the parties could waive.\nSuppose -- suppose that we issued this decision\nand -- and your position prevails. Everybody agrees that\nthis appointment should not have been made. What's to\nprevent the Ninth Circuit from just asking the parties to\nplease waive their rights under this case?\nMS. MILLETT: I think, Your Honor, what would\nprevent them is a decision from this Court declaring\nlimitations on their statutory appointment power. And if\nthis Court -- and if the Ninth Circuit --\nQUESTION: No. They waive that.\nthe parties waive it.\nMS. MILLETT: And if -- and if the Ninth Circuit\nwere to engage, which is not to be presumed by\ngovernmental officials, court or executive -- but were to\nengage in some pattern of violating the statute, I think\nthis Court's supervisory authorities could take care of\nthat.\nBut in an individual case like this, where there\nwas no assertion of the right, this question would still\nbe the same. Did plain error occur that affected the\nsubstantial rights of these particular defendants?\nQUESTION: Yes, but the interesting case\nunder -- leave plain error out. I mean, you may be right\non the plain error.\nMS. MILLETT: I hope so.\nQUESTION: But there is, I think, in Justice\nStevens' question a very important implication. To get\nthe due process part out of it, assume that the people in\nfront of the court are not American citizens. Indeed,\nassume it's Judge Wald going to be appointed to the\nInternational Court. Now, there's no due process problem.\nSo can the Congress appoint a sitting Federal\njudge to go to a foreign place where it's perfectly all\nright with the foreign people and hear their case? Now,\nI'm not sure.\nis at issue here.\nMS. MILLETT: I --\nQUESTION: Not a due process problem --\nMS. MILLETT: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- but a question of what kind of\nfunction you can give to a sitting Federal judge because,\nafter all, we have our two sitting Federal judges in the\nNinth Circuit. They went out to Guam, in principle. They\nconstituted themselves a different sort of tribunal,\nincluding the Article I judge, and no one claims that was\nunfair to anybody in Guam. So there's no due process\nproblem.\nNow, what's the answer?\nMS. MILLETT: I think, Your -- Your Honor,\nthat -- that we would defend that statute, and we think\nthat it would be permissible, assuming -- I mean, the -- a\nbetter way to approach it is that the analysis that would\nbe applied would be as this Court did in Mistretta versus\nthe United States. And you would focus on -- and a number\nof cases. You would focus on what is the nature of the\njob that's being imposed. It's a judicial function. It\nwouldn't be asked to do some sort of Article I function.\nAnd would doing that function so distract or withdraw from\nthe burden -- I'm sorry -- distract or interrupt the\njudge's -- or court's ability to function as an\nArticle III court. That would be the analysis.\nNow, to -- to put a finer point on it, in\nfact -- and the reason I have to take the position it\nwould be okay, is Congress has enacted a statute,\n28 U.S.C. 297, which authorizes judges of the Ninth\nCircuit to go sit in the Freely Associated Compact States,\nwhich is Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, which are\nnot --\nQUESTION: But that -- but that -- you're --\nyou're -- there are two questions. One is can an\nArticle III judge go to another court. That's not this\ncase. This case is whether a non-Article III judge can go\nto an Article III court so that the Article III court is\non some days an Article III court and some days not an\nArticle III court.\nI -- I assume that the law of the circuit is\nsomething the Ninth -- Ninth Circuit is proud of. Is\nit going to now have under -- under your theory an --\nan asterisk by the opinions that are written by\nnon-Article III judges so that that's not so much the law\nof the circuit? I mean, this -- this is the problem:\nwhat happens to the court, not what happens to the judge.\nMS. MILLETT: No, I understand, Justice Kennedy.\nThere are two points to your question. I would like to\nget to them both.\nThe first is, would it violate the Constitution\nto -- does it violate the Constitution to have someone\nwho's not an Article III judge sit with the Ninth Circuit\non a given day? And our position is that Congress could\ndo it and that we would defend that statute based on the\nanalysis I gave --\nQUESTION: So you think Congress could -- could\nauthorize a State superior court judge to sit on this\nCourt?\nMS. MILLETT: No, not on this Court. I think\nthis Court has unique status. The Supreme Court has\nunique status under the Constitution. There shall be one\nSupreme Court, and its composition is specifically defined\nby Article I and nobody in Congress has any authority or\npower to change that.\nBut if you're talking about the territories,\ncould Congress say they have no right to appeal at all?\nYes. Could Congress say your appeal will be within the\nlimit -- as long as it doesn't violate due process or a\nfundamental right, will be to three State court judges?\nYes.\nNow, the more difficult question is, could you\nhave the combination as we had here? And we think under\nthe analysis of United States versus Mistretta, that would\nbe okay, but in -- in particular, as to territorial\nresidents. But even if it's not --\nQUESTION: But, again, Mistretta involved the\nassignment of a judge to a commission. It didn't involve\nthe delegation of duties to a court. And that's what\nyou're -- and that's what you're saying, and that's quite\ndifferent.\nMS. MILLETT: Yes.\nQUESTION: Under your theory -- forget the\nSupreme Court -- the Ninth Circuit could, if it was\nauthorized by Congress, have a visiting State court judge\nevery day as the visitor of the day.\nMS. MILLETT: At least in territorial cases.\nQUESTION: And that would not impair its\nArticle III character. I -- I just find that very\ndifficult to believe.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Kennedy, the way we\nget to this position is two steps. Is first -- there\nisn't, obviously, clearly on point, but if you add\nMistretta to Morrison versus Olson, which had a delegation\nof non-Article III functions to -- to -- that's the -- the\nindependent counsel case -- to the special division that\nappoints the independent counsel -- and so you combine\nthat and you combine that with the precedents on sharing\nof power with magistrate judges -- those together -- and\nthen add to all of that the very limited constitutional\nrights to -- to a particular form of tribunal accorded to\npeople in the territories.\nBut I also wanted to get back -- we think that\nit could be defended. But even if the answer is no, we\ndon't think the constitutional violation would be plain\nerror.\nBut to get back to your binding precedent point,\nwhich I think is an important one, it's -- there's three\nthings to keep in mind.\nFirst of all, whether this is a binding\nprecedent or not has absolutely no effect on the claims of\nthese individual defendants. Their position would be the\nsame if the decision were unpublished. And I think the\nNinth Circuit has itself in a difficult position here. It\nshould address, in the first case, the power of this\nprecedent.\nAnd it's not an issue this Court has never\nconsidered. In Glidden -- the Glidden Company case, the\ntwo concurring Justices specifically said -- they -- they\nagreed that the court was competent at least -- it was an\nArticle III court -- after -- at least after Congress had\npassed the statute giving them that status. But if those\ntwo concurring Justices, which provided the most narrow\nground for decisions in that case, specifically said that\nthey would think -- they would uphold the validity of\nthose decisions that were issued prior to Congress'\naction. And I think this Court's de facto officer\ndoctrine would speak to whether unchallenged --\nunchallenged opinions should at some point have --\nQUESTION: Ms. Millett, I'm surprised at the\nanswers that you're giving, that they're not prefaced by\nwhat you said -- I thought you said -- in your brief which\nwas that Congress did not enact a statute that allowed the\nNinth Circuit to include one of these judges. The Court\nshouldn't speculate on the constitutionality of a\ndifferent statute. The statute that Congress, in fact,\nenacted said that it was wrong to include this judge, and\nso the only question should be what is the consequence of\nthe Ninth Circuit having failed to follow the statute that\nCongress enacted instead of speculating on, oh, suppose\nCongress had, in fact, enacted -- enacted such a statute.\nBut you -- you seem to be engaging in the -- the\nhypothetical statute that Congress didn't enact to\ndetermine whether it would be constitutional.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, we\nabsolutely agree. I was trying to be responsive to\nquestions that were posed. But we absolutely agree that\nthis is not the appropriate case to address limitations on\ncongressional power over appellate review in territorial\ncases.\nQUESTION: Well, I think it's -- I think it's\nsometimes not unusual for us to put a hypothetical case to\ntest your proposition. And the proposition we are testing\nis whether there is a structural deficiency caused by a\nterritorial judge sitting, either by accident or on\npurpose, if -- if there's such a -- a structural\nimpairment of its constitutional role, of its\nconstitutional integrity that there must be reversal. And\nthe hypothetical is just simply designed to -- to\nillustrate the point.\nMS. MILLETT: Right. Well, Justice Kennedy, if\nwe're talking about now reversal under the plain error\ndoctrine, then the types of structural errors in which\nthis Court has found reversal to be appropriate under the\nplain error doctrine to violate substantial rights or even\nto make harmless error analysis inapplicable have -- is a\nvery narrow, small class. And those are -- those are\nerrors --\nQUESTION: I -- I agree with you that that's --\nthat that's a hard point in -- in the case.\nLet me ask you. Do we focus just on the rights\nof the -- of the litigant in this case? Or is it\nappropriate for us to consider the constitutional\nintegrity of an Article III court? In other words,\nsuppose we thought there was damage to the court, not\nnecessarily to the litigant. Can we take account of that\nin the plain error --\nMS. MILLETT: The -- the fourth prong of the\nplain error analysis is whether the -- the error seriously\naffected the fairness or integrity of judicial\nproceedings, which would seem to be responsive to -- to\nyour concern, and that would be the appropriate place to\nput it.\nBut I think it's important to understand that --\nthat the types of errors that are deemed structural under\nthe plain error -- I'm not talking about structure under\nArticle III -- are things that go to -- and I think that\nwould satisfy prong four -- are things that go to whether\nthe court essentially functioned as a court. Does it --\nis it consistent with the basic precepts that underlie our\njudicial system? Was there race discrimination? Was it a\npublic trial where they completely denied --\nQUESTION: But your position, as I understand,\nis this -- this right can be waived, and I'm not quite\nclear on why -- supposing we decide with you in this case,\nwhy next month the Ninth Circuit might go back and ask for\nwritten waivers from all the lawyers in Guam for -- to\nrepeat the process and put on the president of the bar\nassociation as the third person on the panel. Why\ncouldn't they do that?\nMS. MILLETT: Well, Justice Stevens, we're\nasking this -- in theory that could happen, but I think\nwe're asking this Court to decide this case on the\nassumption that judges, like executive officers, attempt\nto comply with the Constitution and don't intentionally\nfile rulings of this Court or statutes --\nQUESTION: Well, they're complying with the\nrule --\nQUESTION: No, but if it's --\nQUESTION: -- if there's -- if there's a -- a\nwaivable right there, and they say we think it's in the\ninterest of harmony between the judges and lawyers in the\nNinth Circuit to let one of the lawyers sit with us and\nsee how we work here a couple of times.\nMS. MILLETT: But -- right --\nQUESTION: And they're going to do this.\nMS. MILLETT: But, Justice Stevens, before this\nCourt would address whether it's waivable, it would say\nwhether it's wrong. This is isn't that something that was\njust --\nQUESTION: Well, you've already admitted it's\nwrong.\nMS. MILLETT: Right. And so I think it's one\nthing to have a right that -- that is -- that is, you\nknow, parties can do with one way or the other and the\nstatute or the law doesn't speak to it. But where this\nCourt -- if this Court were to agree with, I think, both\nof this in this case that this was wrong, that I don't\nthink we would presume that the Ninth Circuit is going to\ngo -- keep doing -- and -- and the Justice Department\nisn't going to defend it.\nQUESTION: No. But it's wrong only if you\ncannot waive it. In the -- the hypothetical is that --\nthat the waiver is right up front, that the person says it\nwould be wrong without the waiver, but I waive.\nMS. MILLETT: No, Justice -- Justice Souter. I\nthink you can have errors that are wrong, but the question\nis whether in -- in -- by not objecting to that, they're\nentitled to relief. That's different --\nQUESTION: No, but the -- the question I --\nMS. MILLETT: -- than whether it's a right they\ncan waive.\nQUESTION: Excuse me. But I think the question\nwas why will this not -- this practice not be perpetuated\nif it is waivable. It is not an answer to that to say\nthat -- the other courts will not gratuitously engage in\nunconstitutional action because, if the waiver is\neffective, there's no unconstitutional action. So it\nseems to me that on your position you have to face the\nfact that if it's waivable, it can properly happen again\nif there's a waiver.\nMS. MILLETT: No, Justice Souter --\nQUESTION: Okay. Let me -- let me --\nQUESTION: The same --\nQUESTION: -- hear that with -- with what my\nfollow-up question was going to be. And you can answer\nthem both.\nWhy -- instead of getting into waiver, why don't\nwe say, under the plain error doctrine, look, everybody\nagrees that it was wrong? Everybody agrees that it was\nplain. And there is, in fact, a serious question about\nthe integrity of the court when the composition of the\ncourt is simply illegal.\nAnd so, if you want to stick to waiver, I don't\nknow what the answer is to Justice Stevens' problem.\nThe -- the alternative to waiver is to face the fact that\nthere's something seriously wrong with a court which is\nunabashedly illegally constituted.\nMS. MILLETT: Justice Souter, when we're talking\nabout waiver here, we are talking about something that is\nunconstitutional, just like someone could waive their --\ncan waive their right to an Article III tribunal, but if\nCongress passed a statute that violated it, it would still\nbe unconstitutional for the court to sit in that manner.\nWe don't think this is an unconstitutional issue. But\nwaiver is not the same as it's something the parties can\nfreely take or drop because you have to go back and -- to\nthe step before that and say this is wrong and it won't be\ndone and it shouldn't be done.\nBut if we assume that -- we're -- we're in the\ncontext of plain error analysis here. That's why the\nconcept of waiver is being discussed. It's not whether a\nmistake was made or whether these people have the right\nfreely to choose. They don't, under the statute, have the\nright freely to choose what the composition of the panel\nwill -- will be. We agree with that.\nBut when no objection was made below,\nproceedings were completed, an appeal was completed\nwithout any objection, they fully and freely participated\nin that, and it was only after the outcome that they\nturned around to challenge the -- the composition of their\ncourt, that's an important value too.\nQUESTION: It seems to me the waiver would be\nstronger if it were in advance instead of afterwards. I'm\npositing a case where everybody agrees in advance we'll\nlet the -- we'll let this director of tourism of our -- of\nGuam participate as a judge today because that will help\nthe image of the court and so forth. Everybody agrees\nwe'll let them try it. Why isn't that waiver more --\nQUESTION: The question isn't --\nQUESTION: -- more binding than the one we have\nhere?\nQUESTION: And -- and Justice Stevens' question\nis important because this case has consequence --\nconsequences and it tells Congress what might be done.\nCongress might say, well, we won't put this burden of\nwaiving a statutory right. We'll take away the statutory\nright and say that Article -- that -- that Article IV\njudges, territorial judges, can always sit on Ninth\nCircuit opinions involving Guam. That's -- that's why\nwe're testing whether or not there's a structural error in\nwhat occurs here.\nMS. MILLETT: And I think this Court's clear\nrules are that constitutional questions should not be\ndecided unnecessarily. And it's not necessary to\nresolution of this case to say what would happen if there\nwas a full decision by Congress to enact a statute to\nmake it -- to engage a confrontation between the branches\nand to analyze whether that would be appropriate --\nQUESTION: Well, I thought --\nQUESTION: But -- but it is important because\nyou're saying that it's just a statutory right.\nMS. MILLETT: And even if it's --\nQUESTION: And I'm -- and I'm suggesting that it\nmight be more than that.\nMS. MILLETT: And -- and our position will be\neven -- we don't think it's a constitutional violation not\nbecause of what Congress can do or not do, but because\neven if it violates Article III, that's no injury to\npeople who have --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMS. MILLETT: -- no Article III protections.\nQUESTION: There clearly is no due process\nproblem. I'm mixed up now.\nMS. MILLETT: Mm-hmm.\nQUESTION: Suddenly we're talking about waiver.\nMaybe I put that in as a -- it's a kind of red herring.\nIt's not a question of waiver. It's a question of whether\nthis is plain error which turns into a question of does it\nseriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\nNow, I take it in all these hypotheticals where\nthe Ninth Circuit is deliberately, which I don't think\nthey'd do, defying a congressional statute, getting\neverybody to have waivers on the record, which are totally\ncontrary to what Congress said, that it would seriously\ninterfere with the integrity. But in a case where nobody\neven thought of the issue, where they raised it a lot\nlater, it's all come up by accident, et cetera, and --\nthat maybe it wouldn't interfere with the public\nreputation. So what has waiver to do with it?\nMS. MILLETT: That -- no, I -- thank you for\nsaying much more articulately than I've been able to\nwhat -- what our point is about waiver versus plain error.\nAnd I think that's exactly right. And does -- does this\naffect the judicial -- judicial integrity has to be\nanalyzed in the context of these individual defendants.\nThe decision should not be if this particular error\noccurred writ large across the Nation by courts, would it\nviolate judicial integrity --\nQUESTION: Well, in the --\nMS. MILLETT: -- as to whether this --\nQUESTION: -- in -- in our Fulminante case, I\nthink we held that even structural error was subject to\nharmless error review, that it was not simply an automatic\nreversal.\nMS. MILLETT: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.\nAnd there -- the -- the types of things that are not even\nsubject to harmless error are not whether a mistake was\nmade under Article III. In fact, in Ex parte Ward, this\nCourt under the de facto -- de facto officer doctrine\nsustained the actions of the -- of a recess appointment\njudge. But the question is whether it's something that\nessentially means this wasn't functioning as a court. It\nis that profound.\nQUESTION: May I -- may I ask you a very\npractical question that -- this case is now here. So it\nhas gotten some notice. What is the Ninth Circuit\ncurrently doing with respect to panels that review\ndecisions from Guam, from Samoa, from Northern Marianas?\nIs the Ninth Circuit continuing to use territorial judges\nto fill out their panels, or has it stopped doing it?\nQUESTION: Please don't tell us that they're\nasking for express waivers.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MILLETT: I'm grateful to say that we at\nleast don't know of that if they are doing it.\nBut as far as we know, this -- this was an\nisolated incident. The Ninth Circuit sat in the Northern\nMariana Islands just last month, February, and had a full\ncomplement of Article III judges. It had never\nhappened -- it had happened back in the '50s, but it --\nQUESTION: It seems it couldn't be pure accident\nbecause the -- the Chief Judge of the circuit would have\nto designate that judge. So that was an advertent act\nthat she designated this territorial judge.\nMS. MILLETT: No, there's no doubt. And there's\nno doubt that -- that a conscious decision to appoint this\njudge was made, but I think the question went to\nwhether -- as I understood it, went to whether there's an\nongoing problem or a policy.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMS. MILLETT: There is no policy that we're\naware of of doing this. It hadn't happened for 50 years.\nIt hasn't happened since this Court granted certiorari.\nNo reason to think it -- that they're going to do it, at\nleast until this Court rules, and on the assumption that\nthis Court will agree with both parties in this case and\ntell them that it is wrong to do that, that it won't\nhappen again. And that's --\nQUESTION: Well, we don't usually talk about a\nstatutory violation as being something that's immoral.\nIt's just a violation of the statute.\nMS. MILLETT: It's wrong.\nQUESTION: But it's wrong without a waiver.\nMS. MILLETT: No, I think --\nQUESTION: So that doesn't decide much in my\nview.\nMS. MILLETT: With respect, Justice Kennedy,\nit's not that it's -- it's right with a waiver. It is\nstill proscribed by statute. It is still unlawful.\nThe -- the waiver issue is only whether when the -- when\nan objection wasn't made, are -- are the defendants\nentitled to the extraordinary relief of plain error.\nThat's not a routine type of waiver.\nwrong. We all know it's wrong, and -- and -- but do\nthese -- does it -- did it really hurt the interests\neither of these defendants or, in this particular\nproceeding, did it offend judicial integrity.\nAnd we think because of the narrow context in\nwhich this was decided -- it was a territorial case -- to\nhave a territorial judge sitting with two Ninth Circuit\njudges, statutorily wrong -- maybe there's debate about\nwhether it would be constitutionally permissible. But it\ndid not make this no longer a court. It did not rise to\nthe level of race discrimination or total --\nQUESTION: Well, Ms. -- Ms. Millett, may I\ninterrupt you there?\nI mean, you have said -- and -- and I understand\nwhat you're getting at. That does not make this no longer\na court. But in -- in a way that sort of begs the\nquestion because the one thing that is plain is that this\nso-called court is not the court that the statute calls\nfor. So far as the statutory definition of the\nappropriate court to hear this appeal, this court is\nillegally constituted. And don't we -- even if we confine\nour concern to this one instance, don't we have a reason\nto find that that fact does go to the integrity of the\nproceeding for the purposes of the plain error rule?\nMS. MILLETT: No, Justice Souter. Our position\nis that it would not because you had a quorum of Ninth\nCircuit judges here, and a quorum is sufficient under\n28 U.S.C., a quorum of two on this panel, to decide --\nQUESTION: Yes, but the quorum assumes that\nyou've lost one who was also an appropriately constituted\nmember of the court. And you haven't, so --\nMS. MILLETT: I'm not going to argue that this\ntype of error is not what Congress was anticipating in the\nquorum provision. But it's not that far, if you think of\nwhat happens when a panel sits and then a judge recuses\nhimself after argument, once the case is submitted. And\nso they have participated. Their -- obviously their name\nwould not be on the opinion. That would be one\ndistinction. But the fact that the judge sat there and\nparticipated and could have had some influence -- it would\nbe unknown -- would not go to the power of the court to\nact.\nAnd this Court has made the distinctions in\nEx parte Ward, four Justices in the Freytag, and as far\nback as Martin versus Hunter's Lessee, the power of the\ncourt to act, the Ninth Circuit to act with a quorum here,\nis to be distinguished from the lawfulness which -- with\nwhich they acted. In Ex parte Ward, a -- a recess\nappointment Federal judge, who lacked tenure, by -- by\ndefinition lacked salary guarantees, sat.\nQUESTION: Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes.\nMS. MILLETT: And this Court said that this\ncourt, whichever district court it was -- I forget, I'm\nsorry -- had jurisdiction. The wrong person being there\nexercising it goes to the lawfulness with which the court\nacted.\nAnd so I think because we had a quorum here, the\nNinth Circuit had power to act. It acted unlawfully in\nthe exercise of that power, but --\nQUESTION: So long as it -- but -- but if -- if\npower to act is the criterion, then your answer would have\nto be the same if the director of tourism had been\nsubstituted in this case because the power of the Ninth\nCircuit would be there to act, a quorum of Article III\njudges would be sitting, and -- and so I take it your\nanswer would have to be the same.\nMS. MILLETT: My answer on jurisdiction would be\nthe same. My answer on -- on the --\nQUESTION: No, but I thought your answer to the\nplain error question of integrity was essentially an\nanswer that relied heavily on jurisdiction. And the\njurisdictional answer was, this is the Ninth Circuit. It\nhas power to act. There's a quorum of Ninth Circuit\njudges. And that would be the -- that would be the same\nif the third member were not an Article IV judge but had\nbeen the director of tourism.\nMS. MILLETT: To clarify, Justice Souter, I was\ntalking specifically about power. On prong four, I think\nwe would have a much harder row to -- row to hoe if we had\nto show that it did not affect integrity to have a\ndirector of tourism sit on a panel, but we --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I agree --\nMS. MILLETT: But --\nQUESTION: -- but -- which is simply to say\nthere are other concerns than the jurisdictional concern.\nMS. MILLETT: Right. Right, certainly prong\nfour goes far beyond jurisdiction. But what makes this\nnot offend judicial integrity is that territorial\nresidents who have no right to an Article III compliant\ntribunal had their case heard by three Federal judges. It\nwas heard fairly. They had no disqualifying\nconstitutional due process biases. They rendered a\nunanimous decision on overwhelming evidence in the face of\nhighly discretionary challenges.\nAnd so -- and -- and you have combined with that\nwhat Justice Scalia referred to in discussing with -- with\ncounsel for petitioner, the -- the counter-concern that\nthere's a judicial integrity problem with allowing people\nto proceed before a court and then wait until there's an\nadverse outcome to challenge who it was that rendered that\ndecision.\nAnd so taking all of those factors together in\nthe particular, peculiar context of territorial residents,\nwe don't think this offended judicial integrity or the\nreputation of these proceedings. They had three judges,\nnot a judge and a layperson, not a judge and a child.\nThey had three judges. There was no unconstitutional\nbias. There was full consideration of their arguments.\nThey had every opportunity, if they didn't want this\npanel, to raise an objection, but they didn't. They took\nit. They went with the judgment, and it's now, under the\nplain error doctrine, I think too late in the day to\nobject to the composition of the panel.\nQUESTION: Given how small the community is, the\nbar is, in Guam and the Northern Marianas, it puts counsel\nin a somewhat difficult position for the judge to say, oh,\ndo you mind if I sit on this case even though I'm not\nqualified. So I -- I'm not sure the waiver was all that\nvoluntary. There's nothing in the record on the point.\nMS. MILLETT: Justice Kennedy, I think defense\ncounsel are frequently -- had to -- have to make difficult\ndecisions. They have to decide whether they want to\nalienate the jury by objecting to evidence. Do they want\nto alienate the judge by seeming too obstreperous? Do\nthey want to seem like they're hiding something from the\njury? They have to make these difficult decisions, but\nthe whole point of an adversarial system is that defense\ncounsel is charged with doing that and you have to strike\nbalances.\nAnd if on balance they decided, which I don't\nthink counsel should think about their own reputation in\ndefending their clients, but if they decided it would be\nbetter not to make the panel angry, I'm not going to\nobject, that's a strategic choice that they've made. But\nat the same time, they may have made the decision, this is\na good panel for us. We don't know.\nThere's nothing inherently prejudicial. Unlike\nmost harmless error or plain errors where it's inherently\nprejudicial to a defendant to admit a confession or\nsuppress evidence about the circumstances of the\nconfession, there's nothing inherently prejudicial\nex ante, up front about a particular judge sitting. And\nso there's important --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Millett.\nMr. Green, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GREEN: This case was not decided in that\nkind of narrow context. It is not the case that court of\nappeals from -- or decisions of the court of -- the Ninth\nCircuit Court of Appeals from Guam or the Northern Mariana\nIslands are narrow decisions, or somehow limited. In Cruz\nversus the United States, the Ninth Circuit decided a\nquestion about the transportation of firearms in\ninterstate commerce and -- and created a split on the\nbasis of a Guam appeal with the Sixth Circuit.\nJudge Munson, in effect, would be deciding cases\nthat would apply to district judges in Montana. I -- I\nthink that is, in part, answer to your question, Justice\nBreyer, about the -- about the Article I judge.\nWith respect to --\nQUESTION: Why isn't the answer to that you just\ntreat them like unpublished decisions? They have no\nprecedential value.\nMR. GREEN: I think actually the Ninth Circuit\ncouldn't do that because of its Article III nature. I --\nI think that would be a -- an exceedingly odd thing to do\nfor the --\nQUESTION: But Article III courts do issue\nunpublished -- quote, unpublished. Of course, they are\npublished, but non-precedential.\nMR. GREEN: That's true, but we know the issue\nof -- of unpublished decisions is -- is changing, and\nnonetheless there may be some knowledge, intra-circuit\nknowledge, about how these issues were treated. These\njudges are, as we discussed earlier, interpreting Federal\nlaw. This was a case about laws that arose from -- from\n18 U.S.C.\nAnd, Justice Souter, I would point out that with\nrespect to integrity here, I -- I think it would be -- it\nwould have more integrity, oddly enough, for the court to\nhave sat with the director of tourism of Guam. Now, I say\nthat because Judge Moore points out in his amicus brief\nthat -- that he is open to attack on the ground of whether\nhe's impartial to the Government. And -- and here Judge\nMunson was sitting on a case in which the Government was\nthe opposing party.\nI would add too that this is the kind of case\nwhere the Court can -- can articulate a high wall, a\nbright line for Congress. When Congress vests\njurisdiction in an Article III court, that means\nArticle III review. That decision or that principle is\nimplicit in Glidden, and this case represents the missing\npiece of that puzzle.\nIf there are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Green.\n"
