        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument first this morning in Case 08-1423, Costco\nWholesale Corporation v. Omega.\nMr. Englert.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ENGLERT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case is a repeat of Quality\nKing v. L'anza with only one pertinent difference. Both\ncases involve goods not authorized for importation into\nthe United States. Both cases involve arguments that\nthe first sale doctrine must be narrowly construed, thus\nthe Copyright Act's importation ban, section 602(a), be\ngiven less than its supposedly intended scope. The only\ndifference is place of manufacture of the goods.\nQuality King involved U.S. manufactured goods; this case\ninvolves goods made in Switzerland.\nAccording to the Ninth Circuit in Omega,\nCongress intended to treat foreign manufactured goods\nbetter in this respect than goods made in the United\nStates. It is wildly implausible that Congress had any\nsuch intent.\nFrom 1790 to 1891, foreigners were\ncategorically ineligible to hold U.S. copyrights. From\n1891 to 1986, the United States discriminated against\nforeign manufacturing of copyrighted goods through a\nseries of so-called manufacturing clauses, including\nsection 601 of the 1976 Act. If Congress intended to\nmake the first sale doctrine discriminate in favor of\nforeign manufacturing at the same time, one would expect\nsome note to be taken of that fact in the legislative\nhistory, but none is. And yet the Ninth Circuit held\nthat Congress in 1976 altered the long-established first\nsale doctrine to make it uniquely favorable to foreign\nmanufacturing of copyrighted goods and did so through\nthe obscure phrase, \"lawfully made under this title,\" in\nsection 109.\nNo one in all the briefs in this case has\nidentified a single reason why Congress would have\nwanted to do so. Moreover, the words \"lawfully made\nunder this title\" are used elsewhere in the Copyright\nAct, and they never mean what the Ninth Circuit said\nthey mean in section 109.\nMost instructive is the very next section\nafter section 109, section 110, which governs\neducational use of copyrighted works and was enacted\ncontemporaneously with 109. In describing the kinds of\nworks teachers may show students in their classroom\nwithout fear of copyright liability, Congress referred\nto works lawfully made under this title. Our briefs\nhave pointed out the absurdity of construing the phrase\nin section 110 to mean made in the United States, and\nit's very revealing how Respondent and its amici have\ntried to answer that point.\nOmega says \"lawfully made under this title\"\nmeans either made in the United States or authorized for\ndistribution in the United States. That argument gives\nup any pretense -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would you clarify for me\nwhat your exact meaning is? There -- your blue brief\nand your reply brief appear to give two different\nmeanings.\nMR. ENGLERT: I hope not, Your Honor. I\nbelieve our -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your reply brief\nsuggests that if Omega grants foreign reproduction and\ndistribution rights but retains U.S. rights, that the\nfirst sale doctrine would allow Omega to bar\nimportation.\nMR. ENGLERT: If it grants exclusive foreign\ndistribution.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why does it matter?\nBecause your blue brief says that \"lawfully made\" means\nanything that was made with Omega's consent or\nauthority. So why the difference at all?\nMR. ENGLERT: It matters, Your Honor,\nbecause of the underlying rationale of the first sale\ndoctrine and the underlying rationale of the import ban\nin section 602.\nThe purpose of the first sale doctrine is to\nmake sure that the copyright owner gets one and only one\nrecompense for each copy, for each lawfully made copy.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if he sells his\nrights to a foreign manufacturer and distributor, he\ngets paid for those rights. Why should he now have any\nadditional rights to bar that authorized copy -\nMR. ENGLERT: The reason, Your -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- from being imported\ninto the United States?\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes, Your Honor. The -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I don't understand\nwhat -\nMR. ENGLERT: The reason is to give effect\nto the examples given in the legislative history of\nsection 602.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Not -- you mean to the\nexamples in the legislative history or in the examples\nin Quality King?\nMR. ENGLERT: Oh. The Quality King has a\nparagraph, much discussed in the briefs, which cites to\nthe legislative history of section 602 and in\nparticular, cites to witness statements that are in the\ncommittee prints that are part of the legislative\nhistory of section 602.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So do you think that\nthere is a difference between assigning a copyright to a\nforeign entity or merely licensing a foreign entity?\nOne of the criticisms of your approach is that you would\ndraw a line between those two.\nMR. ENGLERT: We don't draw a line between\nthose two, Your Honor.\nThe line is -- depends on whether the\ncopyright owner has given exclusive foreign rights to\nsomeone else. And the reason the exclusivity of the\nforeign rights matters is because that is the example\ngiven in the legislative history of 602 and in the\nparagraph in Quality King.\nAnd to give meaning to section 602 and to be\ncompletely consistent with the rationale of the first\nsale doctrine, one must draw some line. Drawing a line\nbetween the U.S. manufacturer and the foreign\nmanufacturer makes no sense. It's not consistent with\nthe purposes of anything.\nDrawing a line between the exclusive grant\nof rights, whether by license or assignment to a foreign\nmanufacturer -- or a foreign distributor, rather, and\nnot granting such exclusive rights is perfectly\nconsistent with the rationale -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You are talking about the\nfirst sale doctrine. The perfectly consistent rationale\nwould be whether there is a first sale. So -- so 109,\nthough it doesn't say it, but if you look at the history\nand title, there has to be a transfer.\nSo in fact, if a British publisher with a\nBritish right given by an American author or publisher\nmakes this, 109 doesn't apply -- I mean, 109 doesn't\napply until there's a sale.\nNow, that makes -- you -- you haven't\nadopted that. Nobody -- I guess maybe one of the amicus\nbriefs does, but I don't see why that isn't perfectly\nsensible and I find no authority against it.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor, since that's\na -- a broader position than ours, and we would -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know it is, but it -- the\ntrouble with your position is it gets everybody, I\nthink, going to be -- I mean, I don't know what all\nthese contracts say. There are hundreds of thousands of\nthem, if not millions. What I don't see is why you\ndon't just say: The first sale doctrine has always\nmeant there was a transfer or sale.\nIt meant that in 1792, when I took Phil\nArita's antitrust course, and he used to bring it up.\nYou go back to the 18th century. It's always meant\nthere has to be a sale or transfer. So why don't we\njust read 109 that way, and there you give meaning to\neverything, and there is just no problem?\nNow, I raise that not because -- I raise it\nbecause since there's only a few people really\nsupporting this, there must be some problem with what I\nsay. So what is it?\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, the issue, Your Honor -\nand you're putting me in a position of arguing against\nmyself a little bit, but the issue is a fair reading of\nthe legislative history of section 602 -- not the text,\nbut the legislative history -- is that Congress did\nintend to allow certain blocking of imported goods when\nthere had been -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course, if you say there\nhas to be a first sale, there is no problem. You block\nthat British manufacturer from sending his books to the\nUnited States, but you don't block the person to whom he\nsells it. Gives meaning to everything.\nMR. ENGLERT: Okay, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, no, I'm putting\nthat to you, because since you haven't advocated it, I\nmust be missing something, and I'm not an expert in\ncopyright law. What am I missing?\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, there is a dictum in\nthis Court's opinion in Quality King that suggests that\nif a publisher and a -- an American publisher gives\nexclusive rights to a British publisher, if an American\nauthor or a British author gives exclusive territorial\nrights to two different publishers, then 602 retains\nmeaning in that -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Exactly, and that's what\nit does under my theory, because there has been no first\nsale.\nMR. ENGLERT: No, but -- with respect, Your\nHonor, it's my understanding of both the legislative\nhistory and this Court's dictum that they refer to\nsecond and subsequent sales.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, you mean you are\ntalking about jobbers? Somebody goes and buys, and so\nthey're -- and so then you lose, because if that's what\nwe are supposed to follow, those excerpts in the\nlegislative history, then it would mean that a person\nwho buys from the British publisher cannot import into\nthe United States because 109 doesn't apply.\nMR. ENGLERT: No, that's not what the\nexample means. It doesn't say categorically all second\nsales from British publishers are not subject to the\nfirst sale doctrine. What it says is in a situation in\nwhich rights have been divided and exclusive territorial\nrights have been given in two different countries, or to\nput it in copyright language, in the language you also\nused in the legislative history, when the copyright\nowner has divided its rights because an innovation of\nthe '76 act, the Copyright Act, the copyrights became\ndivisible.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where do you get that in\nthe text? I mean, that's lovely, and you're saying that\nwhat Justice Breyer suggests makes perfect sense except\nfor dictum and legislative history. Does your position\nmake any sense with regard to text?\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes, absolutely, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where? Where is that\nlimitation in the text?\nMR. ENGLERT: The other side's effort to\nread 602 broadly has no support in the text after\nQuality King, but -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm talking about your -\nMR. ENGLERT: I understand.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- your limitation on\nexclusive rights abroad versus nonexclusive rights\nabroad. Where can you possibly find that in the text?\nMR. ENGLERT: You cannot.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. Well, that's the end\nof it for me.\nMR. ENGLERT: Let us -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I have to say, I didn't\neven see it in the legislative history. I didn't think\nthey made a big deal about jobbers. I like history\nhere. Go back to 1792.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Englert, also talk\nabout what, if anything, 602(a)(1) does, then. It seems\n602(a)(2) is dealing with infringing goods, with pirated\ngoods. So given the first sale doctrine as you construe\nit, what does 602(a)(1) protect?\nMR. ENGLERT: 602(a)(1) is limited to\nimports and doesn't confer a private right of action.\n602(a)(2), which was enacted after the Ninth Circuit\nruled in this case, adds a private right of action and\nadds exports. But it is -- 602(a)(2) is a new statute.\nIt was not part of the 1976 Copyright Act. So it -- it\nis a subsection in which Congress expanded on what was\nalready prohibited in 602(a)(1).\nNow, with respect to text, the text that the\nCourt is construing is five words, \"lawfully made under\nthis title.\" And those five words are used several\nplaces in the Copyright Act, including section 110, \"for\neducational use.\" The government says \"lawfully made\nunder this title\" can mean two different things in\nsection 109 and section 110, provisions of the same\nchapter of the Copyright Act enacted contemporaneously.\nAs a fallback position, the government says\nthere is nothing wrong with having copyright liability\nfor teachers who show foreign-made films in the\nclassroom as long as they know they weren't made in the\nUnited States. So, for example, showing an Ingmar\nBergman film, The Seventh Seal, in class would be\ncopyright infringement according to the government.\nEven the people who make movies don't agree\nwith that argument. The Motion Picture Association of\nAmerica has filed an amicus brief in this case, and on\npage 19 of its brief, the MPAA says that the result the\ngovernment says is A-OK is, quote, \"a nonsensical and\nunintended consequence.\" The MPAA goes on to say there\nis no evidence that such liability has ever been\nimposed, but that argument misses the point. We are\ntrying to ascertain what Congress meant by using the\nphrase \"lawfully made under this title,\" not making a\npolicy argument about consequences, and section 110\nremains a powerful argument that Congress didn't use the\nphrase to mean \"made in the United States.\"\nThere is nothing extraterritorial about\nconstruing \"lawfully made in this title\" as a choice of\nlaw clause, which means: Lawfully made according to\nstandards of the U.S. Copyright Act anywhere in the\nworld. In that respect, this case is no different from\nQuality King, in which the court rejected an\nextraterritoriality argument in a two-sentence footnote.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't really mean -\nyour position is that \"lawfully made under this title\"\nmeans that -- means \"would have been lawfully made under\nthis title if this title governed.\" Isn't that\nbasically what you are saying?\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. But there is another\nprovision of the statute -- I forget where it is -\nwhich says that in so many words.\nMR. ENGLERT: Not quite, Your Honor. In\nsection 602(a)(2) and in section 602(b), Congress used\nthe phrase, \"would have constituted an infringement if\nthis title had been applicable,\" and it says -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"If this title had been\napplicable,\" right? We say \"applicable.\" Much\nprettier.\nMR. ENGLERT: Okay, sir. Yes, that is the\nphrase Congress used to express a certain disfavored\nclass of goods, goods that would have been infringing if\nthis title would have been applicable. 110 -- 109,\nexcuse me, and 110 are a different purpose. They are\nthe purpose of favoring goods, goods that have been\nlawfully made under this title.\nSo, yes, Congress could have chosen to use a\nvariation of the phrase \"if this title had been\napplicable\" under 109, but it didn't. And we are left\nwith the language Congress enacted, but it is language\nthat Congress uses at least four different places in the\nCopyright Act, and we have a pretty good idea that it\ndoesn't mean \"made in the United States\" and it doesn't\nmean what Omega says it means, which is \"made in the\nUnited States or authorized at any time for distribution\nin the United States.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you -- I see\nthat 602(a) is now broken into (1) and (2) and it's\n602(b) that you put entirely in quotes. But what does\n602(a) shelter? How does it coexist with the first sale\ndoctrine?\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor, as you know,\nthere is no reference in the legislative history to the\ninteraction between 602(a) and 109, and therefore, this\nCourt had to address that question for the first time in\nQuality King, and the Court rejected the argument that\n109 is inapplicable to imported goods altogether.\nThe Court did say in a dictum which has been\ndiscussed already this morning that if a British and an\nAmerican publisher divide rights, then section 602(a)\ndoes have a role to play. But the Court did not say\nbooks manufactured in Britain are not subject to the\nfirst sale doctrine.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a concurring\nopinion that says -- that said this case is about a\nround trip and doesn't talk to goods that -\nMR. ENGLERT: Correct, and the concurring\nopinion cited two distinguished copyright treatises that\nsuggested there was some concern about\nextraterritoriality in this case. Well, even the\ngovernment has conceded there is no concern about\nextraterritoriality in this case, so the rationale of\nthose treatises, learned though they are, is undermined.\nIf one looks more closely at those\ntreatises, they argue the language is so plain that it\ncan only be construed one way. The government concedes\nthat's not true. They argue extraterritoriality, as\nI've already said, and they argue that this court's\ndictum in Quality King -- the later additions to those\ntreatises argue that this Court's dictum in Quality King\ndrew a distinction based on place of manufacture, but\nit's only the concurring opinion, not the dictum in the\ncourt's opinion that mentions place of manufacture. So\nit's a vert thin reed to say that the case turned on\nplace of manufacture. And again, one can find nothing\nin the Quality King dictum, nothing in the legislative\nhistory of 602, nothing in the legislative history of\n109 that talks about place of manufacture.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And nothing in the text\nthat supports your position.\nMR. ENGLERT: No. What supports our\nposition, Your Honor, is the text of 109, the use of the\nphrase \"lawfully made under this title,\" and the use of\nthat phrase \"elsewhere in the Copyright Act.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You pulled out of the sky\nthis distinction between having created exclusive rights\nabroad and having created nonexclusive rights abroad.\nWhere does that come from?\nMR. ENGLERT: That comes from the\nlegislative history, Your Honor. And for those who\nprefer not to look at legislative history -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You use -\nMR. ENGLERT: -- that distinction may not\nhold up. But if that distinction doesn't hold up -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know why using -\nMR. ENGLERT: -- that strengthens my\nposition.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did the legislative history\nsuggest what part of the text this -- this novel\nsuggestion was based upon?\nMR. ENGLERT: It does not. The relevant\nlegislative history is witness statements.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I do read legislative\nhistory, but I didn't really find anything that said\nthat they were worried about an American and a British\npublisher dividing rights, and they want them to do\nthat. There is no problem with that, because there has\nnever been a sale. So they divide the rights.\nAnd there isn't even a problem with -- with\nbuyers from the British publisher, because a reasonable\nvertically imposed territorial agreement or other\nrestriction on resale is lawful.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, if -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if it's reasonable,\nthey don't even need copyright.\nMR. ENGLERT: That was not true at the time.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If it isn't reasonable, why\nshould they have it?\nMR. ENGLERT: Pardon me, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's all you -- yes, I\njust want you to respond.\nMR. ENGLERT: It was not lawful at the time\nof the enactment of this statute. This Court had not\nyet decided GTE Sylvania, and territorial restrictions\nwere per se unlawful at the time Congress enacted this\nstatute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Here. But in Europe, I\nguess, they were lawful.\nMR. ENGLERT: I don't know the state of the\nlaw in Europe.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think -- I think it's\nalways been true.\nMR. ENGLERT: But, again, what the Court has\nasked me many questions about is whether I'm giving too\nbroad a scope to section 602 and too narrow a scope to\nsection 109.\nOur position is that section 109 has a\nnecessarily broad reach, and we have tried to\naccommodate the legislative history and the dictum in\nQuality King to give some role for section 602 to play\nin the case of nonpiratical goods. If the Court wants\nto reject anything, if it wants to reconsider the dictum\nin Quality King or not rely on legislative history, that\nmakes my position -\nJUSTICE BREYER: My question really wasn't\nto argue with you. My question was: Where in the\nlegislative history does it say that the point of 602 is\nto prevent a foreign publisher from selling copies to a\ndistributor and then that distributor resells them to\nthe United States? I'm not saying it doesn't; it's just\nthat I didn't focus on those particular words directly.\nMR. ENGLERT: And Justice Breyer, to be fair\nabout what the legislative history says, it is\nstatements by witnesses. It is not statements by\ncommittee, so it's a little bit hard to tell where\nthey're drawing the line.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh. In other words,\nsomebody wanted that. I understand the industry wanted\nit. But -- but I -- is there anything in there that\nsuggests that this is what Congress wanted to do,\nmembers of Congress? Even I draw the line somewhere.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes. Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me write that down.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ENGLERT: Justice Breyer, we do know\nthat section 602(a) has some role to play. And when\nthis Court was trying to figure out in Quality King what\nrole it had to play it did look to the statements of\nMrs. Harriet Pilpel, Mr. Horace Manges from the American\nBook Publishers Council. And those are the statements\nthat the Court said in dicta presumably reflected\ncongressional intent, and so I am relying on those\nstatements for the limitation of section 109 to\naccommodate section 602.\nBut again, if the Court disagrees with me\nand wants to give less of a role to 602 and more of a\nrole to section 109, that is, of course, further\nassistance to my position.\nI would like to reserve the balance of my\ntime for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nEnglert.\nMr. Panner.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON M. PANNER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. PANNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSection -- section 602(a)(1) allows the\ndistribution of foreign-made copies abroad without the\nU.S. copyright holder forfeiting the exclusive right to\ndistribute copies domestically, which is guaranteed by\nsection 106(3), and that provision applies in this case.\nAnd unlike in Quality King, section 109(a) provides\nCostco with no defense because the copies at issue were\nnot lawfully made under this title. That is, the making\nof the copies was not subject to or governed by U.S.\ncopyright law.\nThe decision of the court of appeals should\nnot be affirmed for three basic reasons, and the first\ndepends on the plain language of section 109(a), which\napplies only to copies that were lawfully made under\nthis title.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What do you say \"made\"\nmeans?\nMR. PANNER: Well, \"made\" certainly includes\nthe creation of the physical copy. It also includes the\naddition of any necessary intellectual property rights\nthat would permit distribution in the United States.\nSo that is to say that we understand section\n109(a) should be read to reach a situation in which copy\nhas been subject to an authorized sale in the United\nStates.\nJUSTICE ALITO: See, I'm with you, and I\nthink you -- the text supports you up to the point where\nyou add the qualification. But once you've added that\nqualification, I think you're -- you're outside the\ntext, just as Costco is outside the text with the\nqualification that they had.\nMR. PANNER: I don't think so, Your Honor,\nand let me try to explain why. Section 202 of the Act\ndraws a -- a distinction between the material object and\nthe intellectual property rights that are involved in\nthe copyright. And it makes sense. The word \"made\" is\nnot -- does not correspond to the word \"reproduced\" in\nsection 106(1). It's a broader term that can also refer\nto the addition of these necessary intellectual property\nrights.\nAnd the -- what is, I think, important is\nthe decision whether the copy was lawfully made under\nthis title will, of course, be made at the time of the\nsale. It is not -- the decision doesn't need to be made\nat the time of -- of manufacture, because the question\nis: How should section 109(a) or another provision\napply to that particular copy?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in their brief, the\nbrief for the National Library Association indicates at\nthe bottom -- the American Library Association indicates\nat the bottom of page 38 that \"made\" might mean cause to\nexist, cause to appear, and so that it applies the first\ntime that U.S. copyright law lawfully could apply; so\nthat if you lawfully import it into the United States,\nit would then apply at that time.\nMR. PANNER: Well, I think that that\nprobably gets us to pretty much the same place,\nJustice Kennedy. I think the point is -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it makes the exemption\nwork, then, too.\nMR. PANNER: That's correct, Your Honor.\nAnd the -- that also gives effect to the language of\n602(a)(1), because section 602(a)(1) is actually written\nin a very broad term. It's written to apply to copies\nthat have been acquired outside of the United States. I\nthink -- that is, I think, an answer, Justice Breyer, to\nyour objection that any sort of sale ought to suffice.\nSection 602(a)(1) is designed to permit a\nU.S. copyright owner to exclude legitimate copies, and\nif you ask where Congress said that, it's right in the\nHouse Committee report, in the legislative history.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it can. It can exclude\nlegitimate copies before there's a first sale.\nMR. PANNER: But the -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the -- the -\nquestion is -- I mean, the text seems to say 602 expands\nor falls within 106. All right?\nSo that's what it says. It says -- it says\nit's an infringement of the exclusive right to\ndistribute copies. That's the 106 right.\nMR. PANNER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then 109 is an\nexception from 106. So it's automatically an exception\nfrom 602.\nMR. PANNER: And I think -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's the text. And\ntherefore, you are back at what the meaning of 109 is,\nif I understand your argument. And it seems to me\nthat's the choice. If you are going to take 109\nliterally, then everything that comes into the United\nStates can't, without the permission of the copyright\nholder, but for the exception in (a)(3), and a library\nthat brings them in under (a)(3) cannot even lend out\nthe books. That's one choice.\nAnd the other choice is to say that\n\"lawfully made\" means it's made without contravening any\nprovision of the Act, if the Act were applicable.\nMR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's a third choice?\nMaybe you want a third choice.\nMR. PANNER: Well, a small qualification,\nYour Honor. The exception in section 602(a)(3) does\nallow libraries to lend copies that are imported\npursuant to that section. It's for archival or lending\npurposes.\nBut in any event, I think that that's -- I\ndon't want to get caught up on the small point. The\nmore significant point is that section 602(a)(1) is\ndesigned to permit a U.S. copyright owner -- as Costco\nadmits, it's designed to permit a U.S. copyright owner\nto exclude legitimate copies that are made overseas.\nIf the only issue were one of contract,\nthere would be no need for section 602(a)(1) because\nthere would be no need to create a copyright remedy\nwhere contractual remedies are sufficient; that is, in\ncircumstances where there is privity between the U.S.\ncopyright owner or the U.S. copyright owner's direct\nparty and the foreign copyright owner.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's why I started with\nthe first sale doctrine, because if you apply the first\nsale doctrine as it traditionally has been applied and\nif you believe that 109 incorporates that, there is\nloads of room for 602(a)(1) to act. That's all the\ninstances where the British publisher published -- makes\nthe book. What they do is they have a license and they\ntry to send it to the United States and they can't\nwithout permission because of 602(a)(1), and then 109\ndoesn't come into play because there's been no first\nsale. That's the part of this case that I'm finding the\nhardest, because, literally, 109(a) -- as you correctly\npoint out, 109 doesn't say that literally.\nMR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, section\n602(a)(1) refers specifically to copies that have been\nacquired outside of the United States. So it does not\nmake sense to say that it's limited to the publisher,\nbecause the publisher hasn't acquired the copies. It\nhas produced the copies.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's all right.\nMR. PANNER: So I think that the difficulty\nwith Costco's reading, by contrast -- and I think that\nsome of the Court's questions brought that out this\nmorning -- is that either they -- Costco's reading tends\nto eliminate any practical effect for section 602(a)(1)\nby making it not apply to legitimate copies or it makes\nsubstantive rights turn on formalities of title, which\nis quite inconsistent with the structure of the\nCopyright Act, which actually goes out of its way to\nmake clear that the nature of the rights that are held\nby the copyright owner, which is defined to mean the\nowner of any of the many rights that comprise the\ncopyright, are the same regardless of whether there's\nbeen a transfer.\nAnd so when Costco says, for example, that\nOmega would have the right to exclude foreign-made\ncopies that were produced by a transferee, but cannot do\nso if it manufactures the copy abroad itself, it really\ndraws a distinction that has absolutely no basis in the\ntext of the Copyright Act and that would make\nsubstantive rights, the value of the rights under\n602(a)(1) and 106(3), turn on formalities and, again,\ntransfers that really should make no difference in terms\nof the substantive rights that are available to the\ncopyright owner.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me -- why\ndidn't they say -- instead of \"lawfully made under this\ntitle,\" why didn't they just say \"made in the United\nStates\"?\nMR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's what you say\nit means. \"Made under this title\" means \"made in the\nUnited States.\"\nMR. PANNER: That is not our position, Your\nHonor. Our position is that \"lawfully made under this\ntitle\" would include a copy that was manufactured in the\nUnited States, but that it is not so limited, and that\nif you look at section 1(e) of our brief, we discuss the\nfact that an interpretation of \"lawfully made under this\ntitle\" to include a copy that includes the necessary\nlicenses for distribution in the United States is a\nconsistent reading -- is consistent with the language of\nthat provision and gives -- and is consistent with the\ntraditional understanding that section 109(a) is\nintended to reflect an exhaustion principle.\nSo where a U.S. copyright owner has\nexhausted rights with respect to a particular copy by\nhaving been compensated for a right that has been\ninvested into that copy, that can be included in the\nmaking.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's just not in the\ntext. I mean, like the other side, in order to make\nyour theory of the text appear reasonable, you have to\nbring in a skyhook with a limitation that finds no basis\nin the text.\nMR. PANNER: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nAgain, there is -- because the textual evidence is that\nthere is a distinction between reproduction, which is\nthe narrow term used in section 106(1), and the broader\nterm that is used in section 109(a), which is \"made\" -\nand again, that inquiry is always going to occur at the\ntime of the challenged sale in the United States.\nAnd so the question is as to that topic.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then you are trying to\nrewrite Quality King. Now you are saying that the\nentire premise of Quality King is wrong.\nMR. PANNER: Not at all, Your Honor, because\nin Quality King, what the Court held was that a copy\nthat is made in the United States is lawfully made under\nthis title.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where in Quality King do\nyou see anything Quality King turning on where the goods\nwere made?\nMR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, the reason -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I read the decision and\nit barely mentions that, if at all. Its whole premise\nwas on what the owner did: Did the owner sell this\ncopy?\nMR. PANNER: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nWhat -- there was no challenge in Quality King to the\nidea that the copy was lawfully made under this title,\nprecisely because the copy was made in the United States\nwhere the Copyright Act governs.\nThis Court said in our Descani case that the\nnatural reading under this title is subject to or\ngoverned by this title, and therefore it is a perfectly\nstraightforward reading of the text.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you don't say that. I\nmean, you bring in this other qualification.\nMR. PANNER: But Your Honor, again, the\ndistinction is between the question whether -- what the\nconduct that is being addressed is simply the\nmanufacture. That's the case here.\nThere's -- all that happened here is that\nthe copies were manufactured in Switzerland and sold in\nSwitzerland for distribution abroad. That does not\nimplicate U.S. copyright law at all. U.S. copyright law\nprovides the copyright owner with certain rights to\nexclude. It has no right to exclude the making of a\ncopy, whatever you want to say the making means, in\nSwitzerland. And it is for that reason that the Ninth\nCircuit correctly determined that the copies at issue\nhere were not lawfully made under this title.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How often does this\nsituation -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it would be lawfully\nmade under this title, even though it was made -- you\nknow, made abroad, if what?\nMR. PANNER: If it were made, for example,\npursuant to a license that allowed for distribution in\nthe United States, there would be an affirmative\nexercise of the exclusive right that the copyright\nholder has under section 106(3) with respect to that\nparticular copy. And so it makes perfect sense to say\nthat that copy is lawfully made under this title,\nbecause you need to look to U.S. law to determine\nwhether the making of that copy -- even though it took\nplace overseas, for example -- was governed by -- was\nlawful as determined by the rights that are granted -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is isn't the making that is\nrendered lawful. It's the importation into the United\nStates that is rendered lawful by the agreement that you\nare relying upon.\nMR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, the -- the\nmaking -- the question is whether it was lawfully made\nunder this title. If it was made for distribution in\nthe United States, it could only be lawfully made for\ndistribution in the United States if the appropriate\nrights were granted by the owner of those rights. And\nthat is why it makes perfect sense to say -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are saying -\nyou are saying that whether or not it's lawfully made\ndepends on something that happens after it's made?\nMR. PANNER: In a particular case, it might\nbe, Your Honor, but in the typical case -- let's say the\nHeartland case -- if a manufacturer has a license under\nU.S. copyright to distribute in the United States, it\ncould be lawfully made at that time.\nBut I think, Justice Alito, you were going\nto ask a question about how often the situation arises,\nand I think it's important to point out that there is no\ncase that Costco has pointed to, and we are not aware of\nthem, where a U.S. copyright owner has sought to\nchallenge the resale of a copy where there was an\nacknowledged, authorized sale in the United States.\nObviously, this is a significant issue to\nbringing -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they still\nhave that right. You say there is no case. But under\nwhat theory of yours do they not have that right?\nMR. PANNER: Because if the sale is\nauthorized in the United States, then that copy would be\nconsidered lawfully made because it includes the\nlicense. That copy carries with it a license to be\ndistributed in the United States, which would include\nthen the right for a lawful owner to resell it. Again,\nthat's consistent with the language of \"made\" and it\ngives proper effect both to section 602(a)(1), which is\nclearly intended to allow the owner of the U.S.\ndistribution right to exclude legitimate copies that\nwere made overseas, and it also sensibly construes\nsection 109(a) to give affect to the exhaustion\nprinciple that underlies it. Which is where a U.S.\ncopyright owner has exercised his U.S. distribution\nrights with regard to a particular copy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Panner, can you\nanswer Mr. Englert's point what earthly sense would it\nmake to prefer goods that are manufactured abroad over\nthose manufactured in the United States?\nMR. PANNER: Your Honor, it doesn't create\nany sort of a preference, as Mr. Englert -- Mr. Englert\nsuggests that this is somehow -- prefers the -- the -\nthe copies that are made abroad. But in the same\nbreath, he suggests that this will actually promote the\nsale of U.S. -- U.S.-manufactured goods because\nforeign-manufactured goods may therefore be of suspect\nlegitimacy for purposes of resale in the United States.\nBut the key point is that in Quality King\nthis Court looked at the language of section 109(a), and\nit says -- and -- and -- and it emphasized that to\ndetermine the scope of the first sale doctrine that text\nis what matters. And it says section 109(a) applies to\ngoods that are lawfully made under this title.\nThere was no dispute that goods that are\nreproduced in the United States are lawfully made under\nthis title, because one must have a U.S. -- the U.S.\nright in order to lawfully make a copy in the United\nStates.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There's a whole brief filed\nthat traces the history of that language, and I think\ncomes to a somewhat different conclusion. Do you want\nto say anything about that? It was on the other side.\nMR. PANNER: Well, I think that the -\nthe -- the tracing of the language is -- is helpful,\nactually, to understand how section -- the current\nsection 60 -- excuse me current section 109(a) differs\nfrom section 27, which is, in section 27, what happened\nwas is that Congress codified in 1909 the idea that the\nmaterial object is different from the copyright. And\nwhen it did that, it added that language as a tag-on to\nthat principle to ensure that it did not end up\noverruling legislatively Bobbs-Merrill.\nAnd when the -- when the Congress recodified\nthe provision in 1976, it actually took section 202, put\nit separately, and it -- it codified 109(a) in a way\nthat is significantly different and then it says\nnotwithstanding the rights under 106(3) the owner of a\ncopy lawfully made under this title is entitled to\nresell it.\nAnd that needs to then be read in harmony\nwith section 602(a)(1), which after all, was part of the\nsame act in 1976, it must be read in such a way as to\ngive section rule 602(a)(1) sufficient room to perform\nthe function that it was intended to perform, which is\nto ensure that a U.S. copyright owner could protect\ndomestic distribution rights against competition from\nlegitimate foreign copies. And that's what it -- that's\nprecisely what's at issue here.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How often do issues\ninvolving 602(a)(1) come up with respect to things like\nbooks, musical recordings, movies, as opposed to the\ncopyrighted -- the -- the -- the material that is\ncopyrighted here, a little -- a little insignia, a place\nto a label -- put on a label or put on a -- on goods?\nMR. PANNER: Thank you, Your Honor, that's a\nvery good question. There are a number of cases coming\nup right now through the Second Circuit that involved\ntextbooks. This has been -- this has been applied to\nall sorts of traditional copyrighted materials, and\nindeed that's why the amici who have filed in this case\nare not at all limited but include all of the\ntraditional copyright industries, software, publishing,\nmovies, music.\nAnd, indeed, Costco does not argue that\nthere is any legal significance to the fact that -- to\nthe nature of the image or the fact that it -- that it\nis placed on a watch, because I think that Costco is\nquite aware that what is really at stake here is whether\nsection 602(a)(1) will continue to provide effective\nprotection for the exclusive -\nJUSTICE BREYER: The other side, if you go\nto -- you go to -- go to Home Depot and buy a desk, and\nhow do you know -- are you worried that maybe on this\ndesk it says there was a restriction somewhere, you\ncould only use it for homes and not for offices? Does\nthat kind of thing worry you?\nMR. PANNER: No, Your Honor, it doesn't.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the reason it doesn't\nis because there is a first sale doctrine. Now, aren't\nyou importing those very things that don't worry us\nabout Home Depot into the entire world of books,\neverything you are talking about?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may answer,\ncounsel.\nMR. PANNER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI don't think so. And the reason why is\nbecause, first of all this doctrine has existed for\nnearly 30 years. It's hornbook law that -- that the\nfirst sale doctrine does not provide a defense in\ncircumstances where a -- a -- a copyrighted article is\nmanufactured or reproduced abroad. That has been\nwell -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was first. Do\nyou have a second quickly?\nMR. PANNER: Thank you, Your Honor.\nAnd I forgotten what it was.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Panner.\nMR. PANNER: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Stewart?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIf the government's interpretation of\nsection 109(a) is a little bit different from either of\nthe parties, since I want to make clear precisely what\nit is, in our view, the words \"lawfully made under this\ntitle\" mean made subject to and in accordance with Title\n17. And because the Copyright Act doesn't apply abroad,\nin order for a copy to be made subject to Title 17, it\nwould have to be created in the United States.\nNow, I think our interpretation of the\nstatute still gives it a slightly different meaning from\nthe alternative \"lawfully made in the United States,\"\nbecause at least in theory, it would be possible for the\ncreation of a copy to entail a violation of\nenvironmental laws, workplace safety laws, minimum wage\nlaws, et cetera. And it wouldn't be accurate to\ncharacterize a copy made in that way as lawfully made in\nthe United States, but it would be made -- it would be\nlawfully made under this title, because it would be made\nsubject to and in a manner consistent with the\nrequirements of the Copyright Act.\nNow, with respect to the types of copyright\nmaterials at issue here, the watches are clearly very\ndifferent from what Congress had in mind when it enacted\nsection 602(a)(1). But in other respects, what Omega\nwas trying to do in this case was exactly what Congress\nintended to allow when it expanded the importation\nprovisions beyond restrictions on importation of radical\ncopies. The ideal was to allow a copyright owner to\nsegment markets either to give -- either retain for\nitself or to give to another entity exclusive rights\nwithin the United States, but give other rights abroad\nto other producers.\nAnd consequently, we argued in Quality King\nand we are arguing here that the Court should construe\nsection 109(a) in a way that doesn't prevent section\n602(a) from performing that function.\nAnd the Court in Quality King grappled with\nthe question of whether applying the -- section 109(a)\nto the labels that were at issue in that case would have\nthe effect of negating 602(a)(1) and the Court said no\nit wouldn't, because section 109(a) applies only to\ncopies that are lawfully made under this title. And the\nCourt specially said it wouldn't apply to copies that\nwere made -- lawfully made under the law of the foreign\ncountry.\nNow, the Court didn't refer specifically to\nthe place of manufacture. In giving the example of the\nBritish publisher who would be creating copies under the\nlaw of Great Britain, it didn't specifically say that's\nbecause British law would apply when the copies are made\nin England. But I think that's the necessary inference,\nbecause the Court's analysis made quite clear that it\nviewed a particular copy as being lawfully made under\nthe law of one and only one question -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is your answer to\nthe argument that if \"lawfully made under this title\"\nmeans basically made in the United States, that provides\na great incentive to manufacture goods abroad and that\ncan't possibly be what Congress intended?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think there are -- I\nthink we would say a couple of things. The question has\nbeen raised whether this gives favored status to a\nforeign manufactured goods. And in one sense our\nreading -- from -- from the perspective of the copyright\nowner, it's true, that this creates something of\npotential incentive to manufacture abroad. Now, from\nthe perspective of the potential importer, you could say\nthis makes foreign manufactured goods disfavored because\nthey were harder to get into the country than would be\nthe case if they had been manufactured within the United\nStates and had then been sent abroad and -- and\nreimported.\nI guess the best we can say about the\ntreatment from the copyright owners' prospective, the\ndifferential treatment of foreign and domestic\nmanufactured goods is that at least with respect to\ngoods that were made within the United States, the\ncopyright owner has exercised rights under United States\nlaw. He has -- it has exercised its exclusive right to\nproduce the copies in the first instance, whereas the\nmanufacturer in Omega's position by creating and then\nselling the watches abroad, never exercised any of its\nTitle 17 rights.\nAnd the theory underlying the first sale\ndoctrine tracing it back to -- to Bobbs-Merrill, the\nfirst articulation by this Court of the -- the doctrine\nof the copyright context, the theory is that a copyright\nowner who sells the goods, places them in the stream of\ncommerce, has exercised, as the Court put it in\nBobbs-Merrill, its exclusive right to vend, and\ntherefore it can claim no more rights under the\ncopyright laws.\nOmega with respect to the\nwatches at issue here, never exercised any its rights\nunder title 17, not -- not when the watches were made\nand not when they were sold.\nI do also want to address the question of\nwhat happens in the circumstance where Omega\nmanufactures watches abroad, but then voluntarily\nimports them into the United States, sells them here;\ncan it place restrictions on resale because I think it's\nan important policy question and here again we get to\nthe same point in the end as the Respondents do, but we\nhave a somewhat different textual route to get there.\nOur view is that in that circumstance\nsection 109(a) still would not apply, because even\nthough the goods were imported into the United States,\nthey were made abroad, and that's what counts for\ndetermining whether they were lawfully made under this\ntitle. But section 109(a) is simply a safe harbor. It\ndoesn't prohibit anything. Section 109(a) says if your\nconduct falls within these contours then what you are\ndoing is legal, whether or not it would otherwise\nviolate the copyright act.\nBut if there is a dispute as to whether\nsection 109(a) applies, and a court held that it\ndoesn't, the consequence is not necessarily that the\nconduct is unlawful. The consequence is that you look\nto other provisions of title 17 to see whether it is\nlawful or not.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in your example, if\nthere is a lawful importation of the foreign-made good,\nthen if you interpret \"made\" as causing to exist of\nappear or under these laws, as the library brief\nsuggests, the first sale doctrine would operate.\nMR. STEWART: I think we would say the first\nsale doctrine as articulated in Bobbs-Merrill would\noperate, but we wouldn't place this within section\n109(a).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's the\nproblem I have with your position. You are suddenly\nsaying a copyright -- these issues have to be resolved\nnot within the confines of the Copyright Act, but then\nyou have to look to -- to common law as well, which is a\nvery confused situation.\nMR. STEWART: I think we would still be\nlooking to other provisions of the Copyright Act rather\nthan to common law. That is, in the hypothetical I\ndescribe, clearly there could be no violation of\n602(a)(1), because the copies would have been imported\nby Omega itself. And so the question is if Omega sells\nthem within the United States and the buyer attempts to\nresell them, would that be an infringement of Omega 17's\nrights? And the only claim that Omega could -- I mean\nthat -- Omega could plausibly make in that circumstance\nwould be to say, that is a violation of my exclusive\nright to distribute copies to the public protected by\nsection 106(3).\nAnd I think the response would be under\nBobbs-Merrill, the Court already held that once the\ncopyright owner exercised its exclusive right to vend -\nthe word which appeared at the statute at the time -\nonce it had exercised its exclusive right to vend the\ncopies, it was done with them and had no more rights to\nassert.\nAnd there is no reason to give the right to\nvend -- the right to distribute under the current law a\nbroader reading than the right to vend had at that time,\nsimply because Congress has enacted section 109.\nAnd -- so I think that the -- it would still\nbe the case that in order to prevail in a copyright\nsuit, Omega would have to show that not only that\nsection 109 was inapplicable, but there was a violation\nof the exclusive rights and I don't think it would be\nable to do that here.\nNow in Bobbs-Merrill, the Court was\ncertainly drawing on common law principles but it said\nin the end, its words: \"This is exclusively a question\nof statutory interpretation.\" It -- it based its\nholding on the language of the Copyright Act as it\nexisted at that time, specifically the exclusive right\nto vend; and the exclusive right to distribute copies to\nthe public is no different for these purposes under the\ncurrent statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I found the brief I was\nlooking for which is the American Intellectual Property\nLaw Association. And they trace this back to Professor\nNimmer's 1965 letter, and they say that the point there\nwas that they were reading Bobbs-Merrill as it was a\npre-emption question, that they thought that the\ncopyright law was not pre-empting State law of contract,\nand State law of contract had the exception in it which\napplied the first sale doctrine. Now if that's the\nreasoning, that reasoning would seem to me to apply. We\ncould look up what the State law is, but my guess is\nthat the first sale doctrine applies just as much to\ngoods that come from abroad as to goods that are here at\nhome.\nMR. STEWART: I -- I think with -- with\nrespect to the pre-emption question, what they had in\nmind was a situation in which Omega sells the watch to a\nreseller -- to a retailer on condition, for instance,\nthat the retailer only sell them in a particular way, or\ndo particular types of advertising, and the reseller\nsells them in violation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What Nimmer said is, he\nsaid we want to be sure in his -- in bill back in '64,\n'65 -- not to invalidate any State law contractual\nrestriction on the right of the owner of the particular\ncopy to dispose, exhibit, et cetera the same.\nMR. STEWART: Exactly. I think the language\nwas chosen in part at least to make clear that although\nOmega under in that hypothetical circumstance would have\nno remedy under the Copyright Act, it might potentially\nhave a breach of contract suit against the retailer if\nthe retailer had breached the agreement with Omega, and\nthat nothing was -- in the Federal law was intended to\npreempt the State law contractual remedies that would\notherwise be available. And I think the language\nadequately accomplishes that purpose.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why don't we let -\nMR. STEWART: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why don't we let\ncontract law control the violations of any agreements\nwith foreigners?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: With respect to\nmanufacturing and distribution?\nMR. STEWART: I think in 1960 -- may I?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Very briefly.\nMR. STEWART: Because many of the people\nwith which Congress were concerned would not be in\nprivity of contract with the U.S. copyright owner.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Englert, you have nine minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ENGLERT: Thank you, Your Honor.\nJustice Ginsberg asked Mr. Panner what\npolicy Congress could have had in mind to give this\ndifferent status to foreign-made goods than to U.S. made\ngoods, and Mr. Panner's answer, and Mr. Stewart said\nsomething similar, was that in one respect Congress is\ndisfavoring foreign goods under their interpretation by\nmaking them harder to import. That's not true.\nUnder both of their theories, as long as the\nmanufacturer chooses to authorize importation, which is\nOmega's test, or as long as an authorized first sale\ntakes place in the United States, then the first sale\ndoctrine does apply. So the copyright holder has\ncontrol under their theory and it's not harder to import\nthe goods.\nIn the briefs in this case you will not find\nanyone making any policy argument as to what Congress\ncould have had in mind to favor foreign-manufactured\ngoods.\nThe heart of Mr. Panner's argument was that\nCostco's position either eliminates any significant role\nfor section 602(a)(1) or makes section 602(a)(1) turn on\nformalities of transfer of title. Neither of those\npropositions is true. This Court in Quality King\naddressed the role that section 602(a)(1) has to play if\nsection 109 is applicable to imported goods, and the\nanswer was it still applies to nonowners. That was the\nCourt's first answer.\nThe dictum that has been much discussed this\nmorning was another answer but the Court's first answer\nwas that it still applies to nonowners, and because, for\nexample, software is licensed there is a very live issue\nabout whether the first sale doctrine applies to\nlawfully acquired copies of -- of software. So\n602(a)(1) has a role to play under anyone's\ninterpretation.\nNow Mr. Panner asserts that our answers to\nsome of the questions that the Court has asked in our\nefforts to harmonize our position with the dictum in\nQuality King make 602(a)(1) turn on formalities of\ntransfer of title. Our position can perhaps be\ncriticized and has been criticized this morning not for\nhaving a textual basis, but it cannot be criticized for\nmaking anything turn on formalities.\nOur position turns on the economic realities\nof the situation. If the copyright owner gets its one\nreward, the first sale doctrine applies; if the\ncopyright owner doesn't get its run reward, because for\nexample it has given the exclusive foreign manufacturing\nrights to someone else, and retained or assigned or\nlicensed the exclusive U.S. manufacturing rights, then\n602(a)(1) has a role to play. So neither of Mr.\nPanner's criticisms of our position is correct.\nMr. Panner asserted that section 109(a)\ndiffers from section 27, the predecessor statute in the\n1947 Act, which in turn was Section 41 of the 1909 Act.\nThis Court said the exact opposite in Quality King.\nIt said there is no evidence of any attempt\nto narrow the first sale doctrine through the language\nof section 109(a). And if one looks at the House\nreport -- again, getting into legislative history, which\nsome members of the Court do not like to get into -- but\nif one looks at the House report, the first sentence of\nthe relevant part of the House report is section 109(a)\nrestates and confirms the principle that where the\ncopyright owner has transferred ownership of a\nparticular copy or phonorecord of a work, the person to\nwhom the copy or phonorecord is transferred is entitled\nto dispose of it by sale, rental or other means. No\nhint that using \"lawfully made\" under this title to\nnarrow the doctrine.\nThe last sentence of the relevant part of\nthe House report: To come within the scope of section\n109(a) a copy or phonorecord must have been lawfully\nmade under this title though not necessarily with the\ncopyright owner's authorization. For example, any\nresale of an illegally pirated phonorecord would be an\ninfringement, but the disposition of a phonorecord\nlegally made under the compulsory licensing provisions\nof section 115, would not.\nSo what does the House report on section 109\ntell us? It tells us that lawfully made under this\ntitle was intended to expand the category of covered\nworks beyond just those made by the copyright owner, or\nwith the authorization of the copyright owner. But\nunder Omega's and the government's position, that phrase\nis used to contract the scope of the first sale doctrine\nin derogation of the common law, imposing a restraint on\nalienation for foreign-made goods that is not imposed on\nU.S.-made goods.\nWith respect to the policy incentives that\nit creates it's undeniable that it creates an incentive\nfor outsourcing of manufacture. The government admitted\nthat in its cert stage brief, and again, in its brief in\nthis Court. Obviously if Congress wants to create an\nincentive for outsourcing, that's probably within its\npower as long as it can be said somehow to advance\nscience and the useful arts; but there is simply not a\nshred of evidence in text or legislative history that\nCongress intended to encourage outsourcing; quite the\ncontrary.\nThe very controversial section 601, the\nadjacent section to section 602, required that\nnondramatic literary works in the English language be\nmanufactured in the United States or Canada or else they\nwould not be eligible for a U.S. copyright. So we know\nthat the 1976 Congress wanted to favor the domestic\nprinting industry, not to disfavor it; and yet their\ninterpretation of 602 and 109 would disfavor domestic\nprinting industry and any domestic manufacturing\nindustry. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
