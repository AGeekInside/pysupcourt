        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 02-473, the United States v. LaShawn Lowell\nBanks.\nMr. Salmons.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SALMONS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe officers in this case went to respondent's\napartment on a weekday afternoon to execute a valid search\nwarrant for drugs. They knocked loudly and announced\ntheir purpose. They waited at least 15 to 20 seconds\nwithout hearing any response and then forcibly entered the\napartment. Those actions were reasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment.\nThe Ninth Circuit concluded otherwise based on\nits adoption of a rigid, four-part categorical approach to\nknock and announce cases that is fundamentally at odds\nwith this Court's precedents in two critical respects.\nFirst, it is inconsistent with the flexibility that is an\nessential feature of this Court's totality of the\ncircumstances test, and second, it turns primarily on the\nneed to damage some property in order to effectuate an\nentry, a factor that under this Court's reasoning in\nRamirez should have no relevance to whether the entry at a\nparticular time was itself lawful.\nQUESTION: Did the court here say that these\nwere the only -- the only four factors?\nMR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. What the court\nhere did -- and I would refer the Court to -- to page, I\nbelieve, 6a of the appendix to the petition for\ncertiorari, actually beginning on page 5a. What the court\ndoes is it first creates four basic categories of knock\nand announce cases, and those categories are defined by\ntwo factors, one being the presence of exigent\ncircumstances and the other being the need to damage\nproperty.\nAnd then on page 6a, what it does is its says\nthat the essential question of whether the entry was\nreasonable is approached in the following way. First, we\ncharacterize -- and this is the first full paragraph on\npage 6a. In addressing that inquiry, we characterize\nentries as either forced or non-forced, meaning either\nproperty is damaged or not damaged. The reasonableness\nmust then be determined in light of the totality of the\ncircumstances. Now, the court does list a number of\nfactors that it thinks are relevant.\nQUESTION: And -- and it says that -- that those\nfactors are not exclusive. They say they're -- they\ninclude but are not limited to.\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct, Your Honor. And\nwe take no issue with its list of non-exclusive factors in\nterms of whether those factors are relevant to the\nquestion under the totality of the circumstances test.\nThe difficulty we have with the Ninth Circuit's approach\nin this case is that it has engrafted a rigid property\ndestruction rule onto the Fourth Amendment's flexible\nstandard of reasonableness and onto this Court's totality\nof the circumstances test.\nIn other words, what the court of appeals does\nis it requires that where an entry is non-forcible, again\nmeaning no property need be destroyed, then the officers\nmust wait a significant amount of time before entry. But\nwhere some property damage is required, it would require,\nquote, an explicit refusal of admittance or the lapse of\nan even more substantial amount of time.\nAnd we think that that both is inconsistent with\nthe totality of the circumstances standard because it\nimposes this rigid rule of property damage, and it's\ninconsistent with Ramirez which makes clear that the need\nto damage property, although it's certainly relevant to\nthe ultimate question of whether the manner of the\nexecution of the warrant is reasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment, it's not a relevant inquiry into whether the\nentry at a particular time is itself lawful.\nQUESTION: Doesn't -- excuse me.\nQUESTION: Go ahead.\nQUESTION: No, please.\nQUESTION: I just had this -- I was just curious\nabout one aspect of property damage and so forth. If a\ncitizen's property is damaged by this, who pays for the\ndamage?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, Your Honor, there is --\nthere is a statute that Congress has enacted and that is\n31 U.S.C. 3724, and that authorizes the Attorney General\nto pay out sums of money up to, I believe, $50,000 to pay\nfor any damage to property that may result from law\nenforcement activities.\nas I understand it, Your Honor, is that there is a\nsignificant fund set up based on forfeiture assets, and\nthat those funds are used to pay for damage to property\nthat may result during the course of -- of a search or --\nor other law enforcement activities.\nTypically what happens is the law enforcement\nofficers will not leave the premises until it is at least\nsecured, and then they provide forms or other information\nso that individuals can make claims --\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. SALMONS: -- for any property that is\ndamaged. And -- and at least with regard to Federal law\nenforcement practices, those claims are readily paid out\nand there are funds to do so through the forfeiture\nproceeds.\nQUESTION: Of course, that would have -- that\nwould not apply. This was really a State search rather\nthan a Federal search even though it was --\nMR. SALMONS: This was a joint search, Your\nHonor. This was a -- the -- the search was conducted by a\njoint task force. There were both local police officers.\nThey were at the front door. There was an FBI agent at\nthe back door. We think that this search, although it's\nnot in the record -- I don't know exactly how it occurred\nin this case with regard to whether any claims made for\ndamage to the door. But because the FBI was involved in\nthe search, typically that -- they -- they -- that\ninformation would be provided.\nQUESTION: I see.\nQUESTION: Do they pay the claim if -- if in\nfact the -- the person is arrested and is there and is --\nand does have marijuana?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Do -- do you pay only if you're -- do\nyou get paid only if you're innocent?\nMR. SALMONS: It -- it depends, Your Honor.\nThere are -- there are factors that are considered. I'm\n-- I'm not entirely sure of -- of what all of them are.\nIf there is -- I would -- my understanding is that if\nthere is -- certainly if there was another individual that\nlives in the home or -- or otherwise, that even though the\nentry was -- was reasonable and the need to destroy or\ndamage property was reasonable, if there were other people\nin the home, the officer -- the -- the Federal law\nenforcement officials typically pay that.\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. SALMONS: And even when there's not, they\noften do as well.\nQUESTION: Well, this is a background issue, and\n-- and I don't mean to take you away from talking about\nthe Ninth Circuit's case in response to Justice Scalia's\nquestion.\nQUESTION: Mr. Salmons, may I ask you one\nquestion on -- on your timing point? Your claim is that\nthe -- that the issue of property damage is irrelevant to\nthe question of reasonable timing as distinct from\nreasonable execution. I understand your argument when we\nare dealing with a situation in which there is an -- an\nexigency, a set of circumstances that said you've got to\nact fast.\nMy question, though, goes to the situation in\nwhich there is no exigency. You're -- you're executing a\nwarrant for -- to seize a stolen grand piano or something.\nNo property is going to be destroyed if you wait a little\nbit longer. In that case, where there is no exigency, not\nat the beginning, none develops while you're waiting,\ndoesn't the issue of property damage have some relevance\nto the question of timing? In other words, if there's no\nrisk that anything is going away, isn't it reasonable for\nthe police to say, okay, give them another minute or\nsomething like that?\nMR. SALMONS: We submit, no, Your Honor, and for\nthe following reason, that in -- typically the -- the\nstandard would -- that would be applied in this kind of a\ncontext would be whether the officers had waited\nsufficiently long so that they could reasonably conclude\nthat there was a constructive denial of admittance or\nthat, as you indicate, other law enforcement -- excuse me\n-- other law enforcement concerns may justify a more\nprompt entry.\nIn the hypothetical that you gave, none of those\nother law enforcement concerns are present, and so the\nquestion then, we submit, would be whether the officers\ncould reasonably conclude that they had been\nconstructively denied admittance. And there, the need to\ndamage some property, if it exists at all, is a\nconsequence of the denial of admittance, not a factor as\nto whether the denial had in fact occurred.\nQUESTION: But when -- when you're dealing --\nlet's -- let's take the case in which the exigency\ndevelops while you're waiting. One reason why it is\nreasonable to -- to suspect that you are being denied\nadmittance, let's say, in a case where drugs are easily\ndisposable is that there is good reason to believe that\nsomebody would -- another 10 or 20 or whatever seconds\nwill use the 20 seconds to get rid of the drugs, if\npossible. You don't have any basis for drawing that kind\nof a conclusion in the grand piano case, and there --\nthere is less reason to believe, less reason to suspect\nthat you are actually being denied admittance as opposed\nto simply being the victim of somebody who's slow at\ngetting the -- to the door. Isn't that a fair line of\nreasoning?\nMR. SALMONS: I mean, I think the distinction\nYour Honor makes between those types of cases is a\nlegitimate one. We still think though, however, that the\nneed to damage property is really not a factor that goes\ninto whether entry at a particular time was reasonable\nunder the circumstances. It's a consequence of the denial\n-- excuse me. It's a consequence of the occupant's\nfailure to respond within a reasonable time period.\nQUESTION: But -- but maybe --\nQUESTION: Are there -- are there guidebooks?\nIs there any manual that Federal law enforcement officers\nuse that will say in -- in a knock and announce situation,\nthese are the relevant factors? Do they suggest a time, a\ntime span that would be appropriate?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, there is training that\noccurs, although to my understanding, there's not a\nspecific amount of time that's -- that's provided to\nofficers that they need to wait as some sort of minimum.\nRather, consistent with this Court's cases, the -- the\nguidelines and -- and the training that's conducted\nteaches the officers that they must take into account the\ntotality of the circumstances.\nlike how large of -- of a dwelling it is, what time of day\nit is.\nQUESTION: But there's nothing -- nothing\nwritten down that suggests how many seconds, no manual\nthat Federal law enforcement --\nMR. SALMONS: To my knowledge, that is correct.\nThe -- it used to be the case, as I understand it, that\nthere was a suggested amount of time and that was 30\nseconds when there are no other law enforcement concerns\nthat are at issue, but that currently the training that is\nconducted just focuses on the totality of the\ncircumstances and that they need to wait a reasonable\nperiod of time, and if there are no other law enforcement\nconcerns at issue, then that reasonable period of time is\ntypically considered to be how long it would take to\nconclude that you were constructively denied admittance --\nQUESTION: But not if there are -- but not if\nthere are other law enforcement concerns.\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct. If there are\nother concerns --\nQUESTION: I mean, what troubles me is you --\nyou can't simply announce that -- that the rule is you\nwait a reasonable amount -- what -- what constitutes a\nreasonable of time is how long it would be expected\nsomeone would take to get to the door.\nadopt that as your uniform rule because otherwise, you'd\nhave to use the same amount of time whether there are\nexigent circumstances or not.\nMR. SALMONS: That -- that --\nQUESTION: If it takes 20 seconds usually, it\ntakes 20 seconds.\nMR. SALMONS: That -- you are correct, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: That's not right. Is it?\nMR. SALMONS: And that's a function -- I'm\nsorry.\nQUESTION: That isn't quite right. Because\ncertainly in a motel room, it would be less time than it\nwould in a mansion.\nMR. SALMONS: No. Absolutely.\nQUESTION: No. I'm just saying the exigent\ncircumstances would not alter what is a reasonable time.\nMR. SALMONS: And that's why we submit that the\nrelevant question is not just how long it would take for a\nperson under those circumstances to get to the door. The\n-- the analysis must take into account as well valid law\nenforcement concerns. And -- and all this -- what I think\nall this illustrates is what this Court has repeatedly\nsaid, which is this is a contextual analysis that has to\nbe based on the totality of the circumstances. There's no\nmechanical rule --\nQUESTION: Well, but may -- may I just\ninterrupt?\nMR. SALMONS: -- or a reasoned way to apply it.\nQUESTION: It's not how long it would take a\nperson to get to the door. It's how long a period must\nelapse before it's reasonable to infer that the person has\nrefused to come to the door.\nMR. SALMONS: You're correct. You're correct,\nYour Honor. That -- and that would be -- that would be\nwhere there are no other valid law enforcement concerns\nthat would warrant --\nQUESTION: Well, yes, but -- but that also is\nnot affected by the existence or nonexistence of -- of\nexigent circumstances. So the exigent circumstances sort\nof override --\nMR. SALMONS: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- how long it would take a\nreasonable person to get to the door.\nMR. SALMONS: That -- that's -- that is my\nunderstanding, Your Honor, and I think that's exactly\nright. I would also --\nQUESTION: Mr. Salmons, are you relying on\nexigent circumstances here because it was a drug case or\nnot?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, in this case, let me\nbegin by pointing out that we submit that the 15 to 20\nseconds that the officers delayed in this case is a\nsubstantial amount of time. And it's no -- it's really\nnowhere close to the constitutional line.\nQUESTION: Well, could you answer my question?\nAre you relying? We have to reweigh this, I assume, and\ndo you want us to treat this as an exigent circumstance\ncase or not? Yes or no?\nMR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor, to the extent\nthat --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. SALMONS: -- by your question you're\nreferring --\nQUESTION: That's what I'm asking.\nMR. SALMONS: The only reason I hesitated is\nbecause I think the term exigent circumstances can be a\nbit ambiguous, and this is not a case where the Government\nhas suggested that the officers were entitled to forego\nknocking and announcing at any point in the process.\nQUESTION: This was a small apartment, was it?\nMR. SALMONS: Yes. This was a small apartment.\nIt was in the middle of the afternoon.\nQUESTION: What size?\nMR. SALMONS:\nI'm not sure of the square footage. There are some\ndiagrams of the apartment in the joint appendix. The\ntestimony of the officers was that it was sufficiently\nsmall that the officers located in the back of the\napartment could hear the knock and announce at the front\ndoor.\nQUESTION: Does it make any difference if the\noccupant says, wait a minute, I'm in the shower, I'm\ncoming?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, certainly that would be a\nfactor that would then go under the totality of the\ncircumstances standard. Whether or not -- I mean, there\nare a lot of other things that the officers would have to\nconsider, including whether they're being truthful,\nwhether they can hear water running, whether there's still\na risk that they may have drugs with them in the shower,\ndumping them down the drain.\nQUESTION: But in response to Justice O'Connor's\nquestion, there are no exigent circumstances of the type\nthat would eliminate the need to knock and announce at\nall.\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct, but there are\nstill --\nQUESTION: Are you going to go on to say that\nthere are some other exigent circumstances that are in the\nbackground here that --\nMR. SALMONS: Well, certainly --\nQUESTION: -- that counsel against waiting more\nthan 20 seconds?\nMR. SALMONS: Absolutely, Your Honor. In fact,\neven though there may not be sufficient concerns about\nofficer safety or the destruction of evidence to forego\nknocking and announcing altogether, those are still valid\nlaw enforcement concerns in the context of a case like\nthis where the officers are there to execute a warrant for\ndrugs. The officers are -- have strong evidence that\nthere are, in fact, drugs in the apartment. They did a\ncontrolled buy not long before they went to execute the\nwarrant, and there is the risk at a minimum of the\ndestruction of evidence, and that those are factors that\nhave to be taken into account.\nQUESTION: And that would be true in almost any\ndrug case where the officers know that drugs are in -- are\n-- are in the premises or have reason to believe that\ndrugs are in the premises.\nMR. SALMONS: Certainly I think the potential\nfor that concern is present in almost all -- and not just\ndrug cases, but any case where the -- the evidence to be\nsought through the search is subject to -- to readily\ndestruction and --\nQUESTION: And you say that's not enough to\nforego knock and announce, but it is enough to shorten the\ntime period that you have to wait.\nMR. SALMONS: Yes, Your Honor, that -- that it's\nnot enough to -- at least in the context of this case,\nthat there was not enough reasonable suspicion of those\nconcerns to forego knocking and announcing altogether, but\nthose factors still have to be taken into account under\nthe totality of the circumstances in evaluating whether\nthe officers here waited a reasonable period of time.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Salmons, as I --\nQUESTION: It sounds to me you're asking us to\nadopt the kind of per se rule that we rejected in the case\nthat came to us from Wisconsin in -- in the Richards -- in\nthe context of -- of determining how long is -- is --\nthey're required to wait.\nMR. SALMONS: No. I think not, Your Honor.\nWe're not suggesting some rigid rule that applies in all\ncases. What we're suggesting is that as part of the\ntotality of the circumstances, it -- it must be the case\nthat the officers that are going to execute the warrant\ncan take into account the fact that the evidence they're\nseeking is readily disposable. That -- all we're\nsuggesting is that should be a factor. It should into the\nanalysis, and generally that would be a factor that would\ntend to cut in favor of a prompter entry.\nQUESTION: But isn't it true that the -- the\npurpose of the analysis is to decide whether or not the\nsilence is the equivalent of a refusal? Because the\nstatute requires a refusal. And if that's true, I -- I am\nreally kind of puzzled as to why the possibility of\ndisposing of drugs affects the time period.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I think we would\ndisagree with your characterization of the purpose of the\ninquiry at least in part, and that is that as Justice\nSouter's question earlier pointed out, in a case where\nthere are no concerns that would -- that would warrant a\nmore prompt entry, we think the question is whether a\nreasonable officer could conclude that he had been\nconstructively denied admittance. But -- but where there\nare those concerns, even if they don't rise to the level\nof foregoing knocking and announcing altogether --\nQUESTION: But isn't --\nMR. SALMONS: -- they're factors that cut in\nfavor of a prompter entry.\nQUESTION: But isn't it true, if you just look\nat the language of the statute, the inquiry is always has\nthere been a refusal?\nMR. SALMONS: That is the way --\nQUESTION:\ncircumstances, when you just go on in anyway.\nMR. SALMONS: That is the way in which the\nstatute is worded, Your Honor. This Court has --\nQUESTION: And that's what it means too, isn't\nit?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, we think not, Your Honor.\nThis Court has never felt that the -- that the terms of\nthis statute are to be construed literally. In fact, if\nthe Court were to start doing so, it would need to\noverturn a number of its prior cases, including in Miller,\nwhere it read the statute to reach arrest warrants -- or\neven arrests without warrants; Sabbath, where it read\nforcibly break to not require any showing of force. What\nthe Court has held that it really --\nQUESTION: Those -- those are all breaks in\nfavor of the -- of the citizen. This is a break that is\nnot in favor of the citizen. There -- there may be some\nof us who are willing to twist the statute for the benefit\nof the citizen, but not for the benefit of the Government.\nQUESTION: Maybe others who feel equally.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I think --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SALMONS: I think there may be a more benign\nexplanation, which is this Court has recognized that what\nthis statute does is it filled a gap.\nhistorical explanation that this statute filled a gap that\nthen existed in Federal law because this Court had not\nincorporated or -- or subsumed the common law principles\nof knock and announce into the Fourth Amendment and many\nStates had. And so what Congress did was -- and this\nCourt reaffirmed this in Ramirez not long ago, that what\nthe statute does is it codifies the common law tradition\nof knock and announce, and that includes all the\nexceptions to knock and announce.\nQUESTION: Mr. Salmons?\nQUESTION: How do they get out of it? Because\nhow do you say -- I mean, suppose the person from behind\nthe door says, oh, police, you'd like to come in. I'll\nlet you in. Come right in, but just wait 1 minute while I\nflush the drugs down the toilet.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Now, he's not refusing him\nadmittance. I mean, he's welcoming him. So how -- how is\nthe Court -- with open arms. He's delighted to have him\nin. He says, it'll just take a second.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: And -- now, how -- how -- how has the\nlaw reconciled that which is obvious that he ought to --\nthe police ought to be able to get in there -- with the\nstatute that says they cannot come in unless he refuses\nthe police admittance? And he hasn't.\nMR. SALMONS: Right. You point out a very good\npoint, Your Honor, and that's why this Court has said that\n-- that the statute can't be read literally and instead --\nQUESTION: I don't think they read it --\nQUESTION: I don't think it's a good point at\nall. I think refusing admittance means refusing prompt\nadmittance. It doesn't say you can come in next week.\nThat's refusing admittance. Knock, knock, I want to come\nin. You can't come in now. You can come in next week.\nMR. SALMONS: The -- the point I was attempting\nto make, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: That's refusing admittance.\nMR. SALMONS: The point I was attempting to\nmake, Your Honor was that what this Court has recognized\nrepeatedly, and it said in Ramirez it was now decisively\nholding and resolving the question, and that is that the\nstatute here, 3109, is not to be read literally but merely\nis to be read as a codification of the common law\ntradition of knock and announce. And as this Court\nindicated in its decision in Wilson, that common law\ntradition is a flexible one, and it's one --\nQUESTION: Does that flexibility mean that there\nreally isn't this bright line between exigent and\nnonexigent? There's kind of a spectrum.\nnot exigent enough to do away with the knock and announce,\nthere is then a difference between the case Justice Souter\nposed of the grand piano and the warrant is to search for\ndrugs which could easily be -- be disposed of.\nMR. SALMONS: We submit so, Your Honor. We\nthink that --\nQUESTION: So it's not 100 percent exigent, but\nneither can one say it's nonexigent.\nMR. SALMONS: That's -- I believe that is our\nposition, that -- that although there were not sufficient\nexigencies in this case to justify foregoing knocking and\nannouncing altogether, that the officers here were -- were\npermitted to take into account the risks inherent in\nexecuting a warrant in this kind of a context, including\nthe risk of destroying of that --\nQUESTION: May I ask this question? Does a\ncitizen have a right to make sure that they're really\nofficers by getting a copy of the warrant or something\nlike that? Could he -- could a citizen come to the door\nand say, slide the warrant under the door and I'll look at\nit and I'll let you in if I think you're genuine?\nMR. SALMONS: I'm not aware of case law on that,\nYour Honor. I -- I -- presumably they -- they are\npermitted to do that. Again, all of that would go into\nthe totality of the circumstances.\noccupants I think are things that the officers --\nQUESTION: Because the occupant -- I can\nconceive of situations in which an occupant might be\nconcerned that perhaps it's not a genuine law enforcement\nofficer. It's somebody who wants to hold up the house,\nyou know.\nMR. SALMONS: Well -- well, certainly one of the\npurposes of the knock and announce rule, Your Honor, is to\nprovide notice to the occupants that it is the police that\nare attempting to come in so that it increases public\nsafety and -- and protects both the officers and the\noccupants.\nQUESTION: What time did this take place?\nMR. SALMONS: This took place at 2 o'clock on a\nWednesday afternoon, Your Honor.\nI think one of the remarkable things about the\nNinth Circuit's decision in this case is that the\nofficers' delay here really was nowhere close to the\nconstitutional line. 15 to 20 seconds is a substantial\ndelay. Even if this Court were to conclude this case\nbased only on the question of whether they had been\nconstructively denied admittance, we think these other\nfactors warranted a prompter entry here.\nAnd in fact, the testimony of the officers in\nthis case suggests that.\npolice that was at the front door stated that he waited a\nlong time in this case because he thought there was some\nchance that the case may go to Federal court, and he\nwanted to make sure that there were no knock and announce\nconcerns.\nThe FBI agent at the back of the -- of the\napartment testified that he -- he became concerned about\nthe length of the delay. He described it as unusually\nlong and stated that he was concerned that the occupant\nmight be attempting to flee from another way.\nThis is simply not a case that's close to the\nline, and for the Ninth Circuit to hold that the officers\nin this case were required to wait some additional period\nof time that's unspecified, in addition to the 15 to 20\nseconds, really does pose threats to law enforcement\nofficials engaged in the front-line law enforcement\nactivities in the jurisdictions covered by the Ninth\nCircuit.\nQUESTION: Going back to Justice Scalia's\ninitial question, the Ninth Circuit opinion is wrong\nbecause?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit\nopinion is wrong because it adopts a rigid property\ndestruction rule and engrafts it onto the totality of the\ncircumstances test.\nenough to be consistent with the totality of the\ncircumstances test and, two, is inconsistent with this\nCourt's decision in Ramirez which indicated that the\nquestion of the timing of an entry is distinct from the\nquestion of the manner in which the entry and the warrant\nitself are executed. The destruction of property may very\nwell constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment if it\nis needless or wanton, but that, as this Court said in\nRamirez, does not make the entry unlawful and it doesn't\nrequire suppression. And so --\nQUESTION: Do you -- do you think that the\ndissenting judge Fisher got it essentially right?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, certainly we think that\nJudge Fisher was correct when he indicated that one of his\nconcerns about the court of appeals -- the panel's\ndecision in this case was that it didn't follow its own\nlist of factors.\nWe also think Judge Fisher was correct when he\nindicated that all one needs do is do a thought experiment\nand think to yourself, police, search warrant, and count\nout 15 to 20 seconds to see how long a period of time this\nreally was.\nQUESTION: Do you -- do you say that the -- the\nproperty line is improper only when there are exigent\ncircumstances or in all situations?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, we submit that it is\nnot relevant to the question of the timing of the entry in\nall circumstances.\nQUESTION: You mean a -- a police officer\nshouldn't wait any longer before he rips my door down,\nleaving the house exposed to -- to burglars than he --\nthan he has to wait when that isn't necessary, when the\ndoor is open and he can just walk in?\nMR. SALMONS: That -- that's correct, Your\nHonor, and let me explain why.\nQUESTION: Why isn't that part of the totality\nof the circumstances?\nMR. SALMONS: The reason we think, one, flows\nfrom this Court's decision in Ramirez where the Court\ndifferentiated between the timing of the entry and the\nneed to damage property.\nAnd two, it's important to keep in mind what the\nofficers in that situation have to take into account.\nThey're -- they're waiting and they have to -- they have\nto consider how long they have to wait to either conclude\nthat they've been constructively denied admittance --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. SALMONS: -- or that there are valid law\nenforcement concerns that require entry at that time.\nQUESTION: I'm -- I'm excluding the latter. I'm\nsaying there are no other exigent circumstances, not even\nthe -- the moderate exigent circumstances that are not\nenough to enable you to go in without knock and announce.\nThere are just no other exigent circumstances.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, in that case --\nQUESTION: There's no reason whatever. All\nthey're looking for is how long is it reasonable to wait\nfor me to come to the door. And you're -- you're telling\nme it is just as reasonable for them to have to wait only\n15 seconds when their entry simply requires walking in and\nstill 15 seconds when it requires them to bash in the\ndoor. That doesn't seem to me to be a -- an application\nof totality of the circumstances.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, we would disagree\nbecause, first of all, it's -- it's going to be -- it's\noften going to be the case that the officer, at the time\nhe makes the decision that he's been constructively denied\nadmittance, doesn't know whether the door is locked or\nnot, and he really can't be put in a position where he has\nto check the doors and windows to see whether any are\nunlocked before he's allowed to enter. He's -- he has a\nwarrant that authorizes him to go in, forcibly if\nnecessary, secure the premises and search for the evidence\ncovered by the warrant. That's what happened here. The\nfact that the door happened to be locked or unlocked is\nreally not a factor that the officers can take into\naccount at that stage of the process. And it --\nQUESTION: Should we consider these two\npossibilities in Justice Scalia's case?\nPossibility one, no exigency again, just take\nhis premises as -- as he gave it. Possibility one, the\npolice knock on the door; they say, police, search\nwarrant. A guy on the inside says, I don't want to see\nyou. The police say at that point, come on, we're\nserious. We've got a warrant out here. Open up.\nPossibility two, same thing. The guy says, I\ndon't want to see you. The police bash the door down.\nIsn't the fact that the police could say, come\non open up, we're serious a factor to take into\nconsideration in deciding whether, at the point the fellow\nsays I don't want to see you, it's right for them to bash\nthe door down?\nMR. SALMONS: Again, Your Honor, we think the\nrelevant inquiry is whether a reasonable officer could\nconclude that he had been constructively denied\nadmittance.\nQUESTION: Exactly, and if that's --\nMR. SALMONS: And it seems to me under your\nhypothetical, he probably could.\nQUESTION: And I -- I think so too. That's why\nI put it that way.\nMR. SALMONS: And so --\nQUESTION: If that is the only question that you\nask, I think you are taking a very narrow view of totality\nof circumstance.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, again, Your Honor, in -- in\n-- I see my time is almost up. We think that flows from\nthe principle this Court followed in Ramirez that the\ntiming of the entry needs to be separated from the manner\nin which the entry and the search is conducted. That's\nwhere property concerns come into play.\nIf I may, I'd like to reserve the rest of my\ntime for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Salmons.\nMr. Roske, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDALL J. ROSKE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ROSKE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthis Court:\nThis case is about whether your door, my door,\nand everyone's door is worth 15 seconds. This case\npresents the component of the knock and announce statute\nthat's the refusal component that this Court has not\naddressed previously in any of its decisions.\nIn Wilson, you said that this rule is of\nconstitutional magnitude, and in the Wisconsin v. Richards\ncase, you said there can be no blanket exceptions to knock\nand announce just based on the -- the kind of case it is.\nAnd then we see in Ramirez the Court talks about 3109 and\n-- and so we see a line of cases where from Miller where\nwe were dealing with sort of an oversight of the -- the\nCourt's decisions overseeing the criminal justice system\nfrom a Federal standpoint --\nQUESTION: Well, now, wasn't Ramirez a no-knock\nentry where the door --\nMR. ROSKE: That's true.\nQUESTION: -- was bashed in?\nMR. ROSKE: That's true. And there were --\nQUESTION: And this Court said that could comply\nwith the Fourth Amendment?\nMR. ROSKE: Yes. And the -- the Court in -- in\nRamirez noted that there were all kinds of indications and\nevidence known to the officers of the person, the suspect,\nthe fugitive that they were looking for being armed,\ndangerous, likely to resist forcibly the officers, and\nofficer safety exceptions --\nQUESTION: But we didn't apply the statute\nliterally there.\nMR. ROSKE: No. You never have, as far as I\nunderstand the Court's decisions, applied a literal\ninterpretation of the 3109.\nQUESTION: Ramirez was a break-in -- a -- an\nentry into not the house of the person who was -- who was\nsought, but someone else's house where he was thought to\nbe staying. The -- the damage was done not -- not -- to\nsomeone who was concededly innocent.\nMR. ROSKE: Well, he wasn't concededly --\nQUESTION: Well, he had a -- he was a felon in\npossession they found.\nMR. ROSKE: That is correct. That case involved\na fugitive who was not the known occupant of the\nresidence, and they had developed information that this\nindividual was, however, staying at the Ramirez residence.\nQUESTION: One thing I thought that the Ninth\nCircuit opinion really was contrary to Ramirez was its\nstress on property damage, which -- which Ramirez made\nquite clear was not determinative.\nMR. ROSKE: Well, I think that the circuit,\nNinth Circuit, has focused on property damage as, you\nknow, we have a statute that talks about breaking, and it\nsees that in -- in the context of delay as requiring more\ntime.\nQUESTION: Well, we also have an opinion, e.g.,\nRamirez, which the Ninth Circuit didn't even cite, which\nsays that property damage is not controlling.\nMR. ROSKE: Well, and that's true and I -- I\nconcede that is so. And I would submit to the Court that\nyou can decide that those guideposts cited by the Ninth\nCircuit are flat wrong and reach the ground there that it\nis entirely reasonable under a totality of the\ncircumstance test that you affirm the decision. You can\ndo a decision saying that the guideposts are simply wrong\nunder Ramirez, but the result under a totality of the\ncircumstances test is correct.\nQUESTION: When you say it's wrong, well, the\nargument the other way is what they said. In the lower\ncourt, the Ninth Circuit says that the police waited a\nmaximum of 15 to 20 seconds, and the police say and the\nGovernment says that's way more than enough time to flush\nthe drugs down the toilet. All right? So every other\ncircuit has said 10 seconds, 15 seconds, is the maximum, 6\nseconds, and even the Ninth Circuit has normally held that\n15 to 20 seconds is long enough to wait when it's a small\nhouse, daylight so people are awake, and all it would take\nis about 2 seconds to get rid of the evidence. So they've\nall said that.\nAnd this case, they say, is an outlier. This is\nwell beyond what every other circuit has done and doesn't\nmake any sense. All right? Because the drugs will just\nbe destroyed.\nNow, what's your response to that? That's the\nbasic argument. I'd like to hear your response.\nMR. ROSKE: Well, the response would be that,\nyes, the modern marvel of indoor plumbing does provide an\navenue for the destruction of evidence. It also provides\npeople the opportunity to shower themselves. And this is\nthe archetype kind of activity that occurs in the home\nwhich the privacy concerns are the greatest for. And --\nand --\nQUESTION: So your view is the Fourth Amendment\nthen says even though you have a warrant, probable cause\nfor believing there are drugs there, and it's easy to get\nrid of them, there's just nothing the police can do about\nit except not prosecute the drug cases in these\nsituations.\nMR. ROSKE: 15 seconds is a -- is virtually no\ntime at all to respond to a door.\nQUESTION: Why is --\nQUESTION: What does the shower have to do with\nit? Is -- is it your contention that a reasonable time is\nhow long it takes somebody to complete a shower?\nMR. ROSKE: No, but that's the kind of --\nQUESTION: Well, then -- then of what relevance\nis the shower?\nMR. ROSKE: The relevance --\nQUESTION: It seems to me it's of no relevance\nat all. This fellow said he was taking a shower. Well,\nsurely you don't have to wait as long as it takes the\nnormal person to complete a shower.\nMR. ROSKE: I agree.\nQUESTION: And presumably dry himself and\npresumably put on a towel.\nMR. ROSKE: Grab a towel. In this case, we\ndon't know how long Mr. Banks would have continued the\nshower, whether he would have become aware of the -- of\nthe officers at his --\nQUESTION: We don't know and we don't care\nbecause that surely does not determine what's a reasonable\ntime to wait.\nMR. ROSKE: Right. But the -- but the point of\nthe shower is this. Anybody that's in -- in a home, in a\ndwelling, and in a community such as we have that's 24\nhours, anything could be being -- sleeping and other\nactivities where that would cause someone to be unable to\nrespond within 15 seconds can occur.\nQUESTION: First, just a quibble. But I read\nthe lower court as saying 15 to 20 seconds, and I take it\nas 20 seconds because given that statement, had this been\n20 seconds, they would have said it was unlawful. And so\nif in fact you concede that 20 seconds is too long, then I\nguess I'd have to reverse or is -- you know. So -- so\nwhat I want -- I'm -- I'm taking the outer limit of what\nthey said.\nNow, on that, I want to be sure I've got a\ncomplete answer from you because I was pushing you, and so\nfar I've said all the circuits say 15 to 20 seconds is\ncertainly enough time for the policemen to wait where it's\na drug case, a small house, and you could easily get rid\nof the evidence. In response to that, you said that you\nthought that 15 seconds -- but you should say 20 -- is --\nis actually -- they have to wait that long. Now, is there\nanything other than your opinion, which I respect, but --\nbut what I'd like to know is whether there is any basis in\nauthority or reason or something, other than that, that\nwould support your position.\nMR. ROSKE: All of the cases that were cited in\nthe briefs I tried to distinguish as having differences\nthat were fundamental to the case, the sole occupant, for\ninstance, they note --\nQUESTION: Well, why don't we take the Ninth\nCircuit's own subsequent case where it has a footnote?\nThis is the Chavez-Miranda --\nMR. ROSKE: Right, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- where the court said, Banks\nappears to be a departure from our prior decisions. As\nnoted by the trial court, we have found a 10- to 20-second\nwait to be reasonable in similar circumstances.\nMR. ROSKE: I think that the court in Chavez-\nMiranda focused on the fact there were numerous occupants\nin the -- in the residence and that even if -- if one or\ntwo were engaged in some kind of private activity, the\nothers would be able to respond quickly to the door.\nQUESTION: But why is -- isn't 15 to 20 seconds\nample, if the question is reasonable time, in a small\napartment to get to the door to open it?\nMR. ROSKE: It's not reasonable because it's\nvirtually no time at all. If you're in the bathroom on\nthe toilet, if you're in the bedroom naked --\nQUESTION: It's the time -- it is the time in\nwhich a telephone would ring at least twice and perhaps\nthree times. Usually people pick up a phone after the\nsecond ring. If they can manage to do that, why wouldn't\none expect the same interval would apply in getting to the\ndoor?\nMR. ROSKE: Well, there are plenty of times that\nyou may be home and you don't get to the phone in time\nbecause you're engaged in some activity that -- that\nprevents you from immediately responding. And that's the\npoint of this case. They had --\nQUESTION:\nthat -- that Justice Ginsburg is asking you about what is\na reasonable time, and your answers always get to the\npoint of saying, well, there are particular facts that\nmight have taken somebody longer than a reasonable time.\nAnd -- and that, of course, is always true. They might\nhave been asleep at 2:00 in the afternoon. They might\nhave been sick with a virus so that they couldn't get up\nquickly. There are all sorts of reasons. But the issue\nis -- is an issue of a reasonable time under the\ncircumstances known to the officer. Isn't that correct?\nMR. ROSKE: I believe that we cannot simply\nmeasure the -- the test from the eyes of the officer. You\nhave a duty --\nQUESTION: Well, they're the ones who have to\ndecide how long to wait.\nMR. ROSKE: Right, and they -- what did they\nknow? They knew nothing in terms of exigent\ncircumstances. And I would like to call the Court's\nattention --\nQUESTION: Yes, but --\nQUESTION: They -- they knew they were dealing\nwith drugs, that the warrant was to search for drugs.\nMR. ROSKE: They knew that they were searching\nfor drugs, yes, and not grand pianos. But the Fourth\nAmendment, as you -- as you interpreted it in your cases,\nthat -- you know, we just don't get rid of the refusal\ncomponent or the knock and announce rule simply because\ndrugs are involved.\nQUESTION: You don't get rid of it, but as I\nsuggested to Mr. Salmons, maybe there isn't this dichotomy\nbetween exigent and nonexigent, but that it's not exigent\nenough to avoid knock and announce altogether. On the\nother hand, it isn't like the grand piano. That's not\ngoing down the toilet.\nMR. ROSKE: Well, if you look at the appendix,\njoint appendix, at page 75, and see what the officer said\nabout why he entered, he simply said that he thought that\n15 seconds was reasonable and that this case might go\nFederal and they've heard about problems with this. And\nhe doesn't mention anything about a concern that evidence\nis being flushed or that he heard anything. And remember,\nagain, this is a small apartment. If he heard the toilet\nflushing, presumably he'd heard that.\nQUESTION: Let me -- let me talk about the small\napartment. Might it not be the rule that when -- when\nthere are exigent circumstances, the amount of time you\nhave to give has nothing to do with how long it takes to\nget to the door. It has to do with how long it's\nreasonable to wait with -- without impairing the law\nenforcement purpose that is threatened by the exigent\ncircumstances?\nI cannot imagine, can you, that -- that people\ndealing with drugs are perfectly safe so long as they do\nit in a really big house with lots of toilets?\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Okay? So you have to wait 45\nseconds. They could way over at the other end of the\nhouse. What is a reasonable time for this house? It's 45\nseconds. So let's do all of our -- all of our drug\nactivity in -- in a big house. That can't be the rule.\nIt seems to me the reasonable time is what is\nreasonable to go in in order to prevent the exigent\ncircumstance from frustrating law enforcement. Doesn't\nthat make more sense?\nMR. ROSKE: I think that the test should be a\nprotecting of the individual's rights from intrusions that\nare unreasonable, and that all deference should not be\ngiven to law enforcement officers' decisions. In this\ncase, he didn't suggest at all that he had to go in\nbecause he thought drugs were being chucked in the\ncommode. It's not there in the record and nowhere in --\nin -- below or in the Ninth Circuit did the Government\nargue such a theory. They simply said it was a reasonable\nperiod of time.\nQUESTION:\nthis case on the basis of reasonableness, certainly we've\ngot to take into consideration common sense factors that\nmay be suggested other than by the officer at the door.\nMR. ROSKE: Well, that's correct, but I think\nthis Court has a supervisory power and it has to not\nabdicate all decisions to the officer at the door. And\nthis officer has simply made a subjective decision there,\nsaying that was what he understood would be reasonable.\nThere was an earlier --\nQUESTION: Mr. Roske, do you -- do you have a\nperiod of time that you would agree was reasonable?\nMR. ROSKE: Well, I do note that the Ward case\ncited in my brief talked about the FBI adopting some 60-\nsecond rule. Obviously, that would have been about 45\nseconds more time than -- than was here. I think that you\ncan't set a bright line rule and -- and that it has --\nQUESTION: Can you set a rule for the facts of\nthis case?\nMR. ROSKE: Well, we need to set a prophylactic\nrule that recognizes the -- the dignity and the importance\nof the refusal component. In this case --\nQUESTION: I know, but what do you think that\nrule is?\nQUESTION: Length-of-the-shower rule.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: For this case.\nMR. ROSKE: I'm -- I'm suggesting that --\nQUESTION: Well, no. I think you have agreed\nthe fact he's in the shower really is irrelevant because\nthe officers didn't know it, and you must judge these\nthings ex ante not ex post.\nMR. ROSKE: Right. And I -- I agree. Just as\nthey -- if they had heard the toilet flushing repeatedly,\nthat might be a factor to hasten their --\nQUESTION: No, but I'm still curious if you --\nif you do have a view as to what would be reasonable on\nthe facts of this case.\nMR. ROSKE: Well, I think that -- that certainly\n15 seconds was an unreasonably short period of time, and\nthat --\nQUESTION: I understand you think 15 to 20\nseconds is unreasonable. Do you have a view as to what\nwould have been reasonable?\nMR. ROSKE: I believe that a -- a wait towards a\nminute might be more reasonable under these facts where\nthey have absolute -- see, they're confronted with silence\nat the door. It's not as if there's anything giving them\nany kind --\nQUESTION: Yes, but so you have to be contending\nthat the Constitution requires them to wait -- the\nConstitution and the statute required them to wait a\ncertain period of time that was longer than 15 to 20\nseconds.\nMR. ROSKE: What we're --\nQUESTION: And if so, I just wonder if you have\na theory as to how much longer.\nMR. ROSKE: Well, I -- I --\nQUESTION: I know say that 60 minutes -- 60\nseconds would have been okay.\nMR. ROSKE: Honestly, I don't know what would be\na figure to put on that. I just know that this 15 to 20\nseconds was too little time.\nQUESTION: Well, would you be making the same\nargument if it had been 30 seconds? Let's put it that\nway. Would you be here --\nMR. ROSKE: It would --\nQUESTION: -- making this same argument?\nMR. ROSKE: My argument would be less strong as\nmore time passed. In this fair city, you're given 30\nseconds to cross a major boulevard according to the -- the\nflashing time, and Mr. Banks had less than 15 to respond\nto his door.\nQUESTION: I thought it was 15 to 20, the point\nJustice Breyer made.\nMR. ROSKE: Well --\nQUESTION: You keep saying 15, but I thought --\nI thought we took the facts --\nMR. ROSKE: Well --\nQUESTION: -- as 15 to 20. Do we not?\nMR. ROSKE: The officer --\nQUESTION: Is there something else?\nMR. ROSKE: The officer conducting the entry\ntestified that it was at least 15 seconds. Now, the FBI\nofficer -- or agent in the back of the building thought it\nwas closer to 20. I submit that the officer who --\nQUESTION: And what did the court below treat it\nas?\nMR. ROSKE: 15 to 20 seconds.\nQUESTION: So don't we just take that as a given\nin resolving it? You don't want us to redetermine the\nfacts, do you?\nMR. ROSKE: No, I do not wish the Court to -- to\nredetermine the facts. I just simply point out that of\nthe two time frames that were cited below in the record,\nthe officer at the door was in the better position, I\nbelieve, to know how much time elapsed since he was\nconducting the entry.\nQUESTION: But -- and he says it's a minimum --\na minimum of 15, and you used the word maximum a few\ntimes. There's no evidence of 15 maximum.\nMR. ROSKE: At least 15 seconds is the quote\nthat I have at -- at page 75 of the joint appendix of the\nofficer Wilson.\nAnd the refusal component of the -- of the knock\nand announce statute is, of course -- it's not frozen in\ntime, I understand, but it was considered to be an\nimportant element and component of the -- of the knock and\nannounce statute. It wasn't some -- it had dignity. It\nhad purpose, and its purpose is served, including the\nprotection of the officers, when they come to the door and\nknock at a citizen's residence.\nAnd they knock at a substantial number of\ninnocent citizens' residents, and their doors were 15\nseconds to 20 seconds, absent any kind of exigent\ncircumstance at all, that they may just simply believe\nthat they're going to find drugs at the residence. I\ncited in --\nQUESTION: It's not that they believe. They've\n-- they've established probable cause before a magistrate,\nprobable cause to believe that there's contraband in the\napartment.\nMR. ROSKE: They did, Your Honor. And -- but\nwhat I want to point out is that they waited 7 days from\nthe time they got the warrant to execute it. They\ncouldn't wait more -- a few more seconds at the time they\nwere at the threshold.\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, you're not inclined to\nflush it down the toilet when there's nobody knocking at\nthe door.\nMR. ROSKE: Well --\nQUESTION: I mean, this is valuable stuff.\nYou're going to get rid of it during those 7 days? You're\ngoing to get rid of it after you hear somebody saying,\npolice at the door.\nMR. ROSKE: Well, but in this case there was no\neffort and there was nothing in the record to suggest\nthere was any destruction of evidence by Mr. Banks in this\ncase. And I think that it's an overbroad assumption that\nevery time the officers come on a search warrant for drugs\nthat the person that they're going to be searching is\ngoing to go to the commode and chuck it.\nQUESTION: Well, he was taking a shower. He\nprobably didn't even hear them at the door.\nMR. ROSKE: He did not --\nQUESTION: Had he not been taking a shower, he\nmight have been flushing the toilet.\nMR. ROSKE: Well, we -- we know -- all we know\nis that he was in the shower and that he made no effort,\nupon hearing the door crash in, to -- to take any step in\nthat direction.\nQUESTION: And given his condition when he did\ncome to the door, it's likely that 30 seconds wouldn't\nhave made any difference. Isn't it so?\nMR. ROSKE: Well, the inevitable discovery\ndoctrine I know has been much raised here by the Solicitor\nGeneral's office in their brief, but it has no application\nin a prophylactic rule that, of course, as the -- the\nrefusal component should be. Obviously, it's not a\nsituation this Court was confronted with in Nix where\nthere was an independent investigation finding a -- a\nyoung girl's body, that the investigation by the community\nto find that was wholly independent of the law officers'\nefforts there to a -- a confession.\nSo it just has -- if -- if you find that there\nis a violation here that -- that the inevitable discovery\ndoctrine simply would have no -- no purpose or effect in\n-- in your determination, because if you do decide that,\nas the Seventh Circuit has, that inevitable discovery\ndoctrine applies to all knock and announce issues, you'll\nessentially have no judicial review. You have the title,\nI suppose, 1983 actions that might be brought occasionally\nbut those are of no real deterrent to law enforcement.\nThey --\nQUESTION: Going back to -- to not getting into\nthe inevitable discovery rule, but you have said that the\njudgment of the Ninth Circuit was right although not its\nopinion. So if you were to explain why that judgment is\nright, what would you say? What would you say about\ndestroying the -- the door? What would you say about the\n15 to 20 seconds? What would be the opinion that you\nwould write to justify this judgment?\nMR. ROSKE: I would -- I would focus on the fact\nthat we're dealing with a dwelling and not an office, that\nwe're dealing with a habitation where private activities\noccur and routinely, and that in this case there was\nabsolutely nothing to give the officers at the threshold\nany additional reason or justification for acting wtih\nhaste. I would say that the court --\nQUESTION: What about the -- the drugs, the --\nthe fact that it was a drug charge and that drugs were\nthought to be on the premises? Do you not think that\ngives then officers at least a factor other than the\nsimply bare bones thing?\nMR. ROSKE: Well, yes, I -- I would agree that,\nyou know, obviously if it were televisions or if it were\ngrand pianos, the idea that somebody is going to chop them\ninto splinters or into fragments and the -- thwart the\nofficer's whole purpose would entirely evaporate. It was\nargued by the Solicitor General that in fact they thought\nthat maybe the place wasn't even occupied and therefore\nthey were doing an -- a senseless or a needless act by --\nby delaying and knocking and announcing repetitively. In\nany event, I think that this case is -- is one where if\nthey truly believed it was unoccupied, that there would be\nno harm and foul on the officer erring on the side of\ncaution and waiting.\nQUESTION: Mr. Roske, going back to your\ninevitable discovery point, was that raised by the\nGovernment in the district court?\nMR. ROSKE: Not at the district court, not at\nthe Ninth Circuit.\nQUESTION: May I ask another question? We\ntalked about the case as though it involves just searches\nfor drugs. But isn't it true that in this case and in\nfact in many cases, the officers will also pick up\nsubstantial amounts of cash and weapons, which are not apt\nto be -- neither of which is apt to be flushed down the\ntoilet, I wouldn't think.\nMR. ROSKE: In -- in fact, in this case there\nwere three firearms recovered from Mr. Banks' apartment.\nOne of them was out on the couch in the front room. Two\nweapons were back in the south -- I believe -- east bed --\nwest bedroom, excuse me. Southwest bedroom. And yes, and\nthere was about $6,000 of currency located throughout the\napartment.\nThe dimensions of the apartment were not\ndeveloped below, but basically the place is about 20 by\n33.\nThe -- the layout of the residence is put in a\ndiagram that's part of the appendix.\nAnd I just want to point out that in -- in King\nEdward I's reign, this is where we get the knock and\nannounce statute. He lived in unsettled times, and he was\nactually out of his kingdom when the word that his father\nhad died came to him. He was on a trip from the Holy\nLand, and he was in Genoa. And he had to rush back to his\nkingdom to find it in disarray. His men were running\namuck. And the knock and announce statute, which hails\nfrom the -- this ancient time, was passed, just to prevent\nthe kinds of abuses that we can see happening today.\nThere was a reverend in Boston that that lost\nhis life as a result of the law enforcement erroneously\nsearching a residence. Had he been given the knock and\nannounce and been able to respond to the door, maybe he\nwould he wouldn't be dead.\nThere's another instance I cited in my brief\nabout a Fortune 500 executive who had -- in the middle of\nthe night, had is home searched erroneously for drugs, and\nhe was shot several times defending his habitation.\nThese are important considerations that it's not\njust the guilty that are protected by the knock and\nannounce rule. It is -- it is everyone that -- that\nbenefits, the innocent and the guilty.\nQUESTION: Well, the guilty perhaps benefit more\nthan the innocent.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROSKE: True enough, but that -- but -- but\nwhen -- when we have a suppression, when we have a case\nwhere the court acts as it has in the Banks case, that\nprovides a lesson for law enforcement that they do heed,\nand it has a deterrent effect. Your opinions do matter\ngreatly.\nAnd I just think that the wise decision here\nwouldn't be to create a bright line rule, to set in stone\nany kind of time limit, that the totality of the\ncircumstances test decided by the Ninth Circuit is the one\nthat needs to be used. And I know that the Ninth Circuit\nstruggled with the fact that the common law knock and\nannounce provision, you know, dealt with concerns of\ndestruction of the door and destruction of the habitation\nand concerns of privacy, a man's home being his castle.\nAnd we do that no honor when in 15 seconds to 20 seconds\nthat door goes down.\nAnd there was no refusal in this case, and the\nrecord is entirely barren of that.\nrequired at common law. And I understand at -- the\nConstitution was not frozen, you know, at the time of the\nenactment of the Bill of Rights. It has developed and\nevolved, but all of the -- all of the exceptions that --\nthat have been applied by the lower courts in this area\nare distinguishable from Banks.\nAnd I thank the Court if the Court has no\nfurther questions of me.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Roske.\nMr. Salmons, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SALMONS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nUnless the Court has any further questions, the Government\nsubmits that the judgment below should be reversed.\nQUESTION: I have a question just with regard to\nyour opposing counsel's last assertion. Do -- do you know\nwhether the rule you're arguing for would have been\napplied in 1791?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, Your Honor, what I do know\nis that as this Court indicated in its decision in Wilson\nwhere it incorporated the common law tradition into the\nFourth Amendment standard of reasonableness, that the\nstandard at common law was a flexible one. It didn't\nrequire knock and announce in all cases, and it took into\naccount a variety of law enforcement concerns and, we\nwould submit, including the risk that there might be\ndangers to the officer's safety or that evidence might be\ndisposed of. So we think that our rule is perfectly\nconsistent both with the common law tradition and with\nthis Court's decision in Wilson that incorporated it.\nQUESTION: But you don't disagree with the fact\nthat the -- or the -- the claim that the statute does\napply? There was a duty to knock and announce.\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct, Your Honor. We're\nnot suggesting there was some exception to the knock and\nannounce rule.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nSalmons.\n"
