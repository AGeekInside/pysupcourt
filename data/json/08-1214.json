        "content": "(10:59 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext this morning in Case 08-1214, Granite Rock\nCompany v. the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.\nMr. Mathiason.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GARRY G. MATHIASON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MATHIASON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThis case involves two questions. Taking\nthem in the order that the Ninth Circuit addressed\nthem, we look first at whether the complaint contained\nsufficient facts to support a cause of action against\na non-signatory international union that engages in a\ncompany-wide strike that violates the no-strike clause\nof a contract between the local and the employer.\nThis is not a strike for higher wages,\nbetter benefits; it's a strike for an amendment to the\ncontract that would provide immunity for the\ninternational and other locals with regard to past\nwrongdoing. The --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a tort action,\nright?\nMR. MATHIASON: It is a tort action by being\nstructured as inducement and interference. It is\ngrounded in contract. Specifically, what you would\nlook for, for jurisdiction, is to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose --\ngrounded in contract. I suppose the existence of a\ncontract is an evidentiary matter that you have to\nestablish, but the cause of action is still tort, and\nof course 301(a) is limited to violations of\ncontracts.\nMR. MATHIASON: Your Honor, 301(a) provides\njurisdiction if there's a suit for a breach -- if\nthere's a suit for violation of a contract, and that\ncan be between a nonparty and a party, and then the\ncontract is between the union and the employer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't see how\nsomebody who is not a party to the contract can\nviolate the contract. They can be liable for all\nsorts of things, but I don't see that they can be\nliable for violating the contract.\nMR. MATHIASON: Mr. Chief Justice, the\nconcept that we are advancing is the plain language of\nthe statute. Violation of a contract is right at the\nheart of this suit. You have for 150 years,\njurisprudence where in enforcing contracts, which is\nthe central mission of the statute, there --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose you can\nhave tortious interference with the contract. Can\nyou, without the -- establishing the existence of a\ncontract?\nMR. MATHIASON: I can't imagine how you\nwould. You might have a different --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I suppose\nthat's --\nMR. MATHIASON: -- kind of tort.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- tortious\ninterference with -- what is it, the ability to enter\ninto a contract, I think, is recognized in some\njurisdictions.\nMR. MATHIASON: That's -- that's cognizable.\nThat's certainly not here.\nWhat we're doing is looking at a very minor\nadjustment in what would otherwise be a\nstraightforward contract action; and that is that you\nhave a situation where the international displaced the\nlocal after the contract was entered into, took\ncontrol, and that control we manifested in several\nspecific points within our complaint. And another way\n-- it's effectively an agency relationship between the\n-- at that point between the international and the\nlocal, but it's an agency relationship to control them\nto effect the breach.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, then you could have\nsued on an agency claim, couldn't you?\nMR. MATHIASON: We did originally look at an\nagency claim. The problem with that is that under an\nagency claim, at the time the contract was formed,\nit's clear the local was not operating on behalf of\nthe international. It was --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I mean -- if\nyou're coming up and saying, well, we have a\nprincipal-agent here, I could understand that, but\nthat's I didn't think the question we are here to\ndecide.\nMR. MATHIASON: The question to decide is\nwhether there's a cause of action.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: On -- on the tortious\ninterference as to whether or not that's under 301.\nSure, agent-principal, I understand that. But that --\nthat's a new argument so far as I'm concerned.\nMR. MATHIASON: Your Honor, that argument\nreally isn't new at all. With regard --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it your briefs? Is it\npart of the question?\nMR. MATHIASON: It is in our briefs. It is\ndirectly in our briefs. With regard to a footnote, we\nactually say that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the -- the basic\nquestion is -- the Chief Justice began with it --\nisn't this -- isn't this a tort action? You say,\nwell, it's grounded in contract. I -- I really have a\nproblem with the word \"grounded.\" If you say it\nnecessarily implicates or it's entangled, then I could\nunderstand that. But grounded in contract -- we ask\nwhat the source of the original obligation is. And\nthese parties were not -- or the international was not\npart of the -- part of the -- part of the contract.\nMR. MATHIASON: We take the position that\nthe contract has within it the protection of the\ncontract. In other words, if you have a party that is\nin a position to control one of the signatories to the\ncontract and they cause that signatory to breach the\ncontract, and -- then in every regard that is the\nequivalent of a violation of contract. They are the\nresponsible party. They -- to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So suddenly it's all a lot\nof things that would have been pre-empted to go to the\nboard. For example, you have a labor dispute on a\nconstruction business, and one union's out there\ntelling the other: Keep on going. And then some\nother group comes in and says: Don't let them do that\nto you. And another says: You don't have to do that\nunder your contract. And there are 19 unions and they\nare all fighting about -- each other, and everybody is\ngoing to end up suing each other in Federal court.\nI thought the purpose of the LMRA was to\nstop that. The purpose of the Labor Act, the Wagner\nAct was to stop that. They didn't want Federal courts\nany more than State courts interfering in that kind of\nthing. So why should we read an exception into this?\nMR. MATHIASON: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It would reproduce the\nsituation that led all the Congresses and Presidents\nin the 1930s to stop it.\nMR. MATHIASON: Your Honor, the very essence\nof section 301 was to deal with midterm contract\nstrikes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's right, and they\nsaid: Here's how we'll deal with that. We'll deal\nwith that by giving the employer and the union a right\nto go into court and enforce the contract or get\ndamages for its violation. That we figure furthers\nlabor relations.\nBut it's pretty hard for me to see how it\ncould further labor relations by letting any third\nparty under the sun come in and say everything that\nwent on during a labor dispute is a -- is a tort in\nrespect to the contract that might not even have been\nsigned yet.\nMR. MATHIASON: Your Honor, what you have\njust described in terms of the impact on labor\nrelations is exactly what we are focused on here.\nThis is not any party. This is the international that\neffectively displaces, takes control, tells the\nemployer that they have the independent ability to\nresolve the dispute --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are not arguing us\ncreating Federal common law for tortious interference.\nYou are saying they're the actual party to the\ncontract. So which theory are you -- are you arguing?\nMR. MATHIASON: We originally made the\nargument that they were -- they were the moving party,\nthe undisclosed principal, that actually caused the\ncontract to come into existence. We can't factually\nsupport that. They were upset with the decision to\nenter into the contract.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you've given up the\nagency argument?\nMR. MATHIASON: We abandoned it only with\nregard to formation. We absolutely did not and do not\nabandon that argument thereafter for the breach.\nThereafter, what happened is you have the\ninternational taking control of the local and causing\nthe local to breach the contract. And that\ndifferentiates it from many, many other circumstances\nwhere you have third parties.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me the\nstrongest argument you have is that this tortious\ninterference is pre-empted under State law. So we\nhave a -- a vacuum if we don't accept -- accept your\nview.\nLet me ask you this: My understanding is --\ncorrect me if I am wrong, please -- this Court has not\nsaid that they -- that the State law cause of action\nfor interference with contract relations is pre\nempted. This Court has not said that. Am I correct\nabout that?\nMR. MATHIASON: This Court would --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The circuits have said\nthat, but we haven't said that. Am I right about\nthat?\nMR. MATHIASON: Your Honor, with all due\nrespect, I think this cause of action would clearly be\npre-empted under Allis-Chalmers and subsequent\ndecisions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. I'm talking --\nI'm talking specifically that -- interference with\nadvantageous business relations or interfering with an\nexisting contract -- that, we have not addressed in\nthis Court.\nMR. MATHIASON: In Allis-Chalmers, the Court\ndid address the pre-emption doctrine and indicated\nthat it would extend to torts.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but it did not --\nit did not include interference with a -- with a\ncontractual relation. We have not, as a specific\nholding -- tell me if I'm wrong. I will look at\nAllis-Chalmers.\nMR. MATHIASON: No, Your Honor, I think\nyou're correct, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Allis-Chalmers involved the\ntwo parties to the contract, a tort claim by one party\nto the contract against the other party to the\ncontract, right?\nMR. MATHIASON: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And this involves a tort\nclaim by one party to the contract against a third\nparty. It seems to me it's quite -- quite different\nfrom Allis-Chalmers.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it would seem to me\nthat one of your strongest points is that this is pre\nempted by State law. If -- if that's not true, then\nwe would be deciding the case based on a premise that\nis -- is unclear.\nMR. MATHIASON: Your Honor, we have taken\nthe strong position that it is pre-empted by 301. It\nwill involve an interpretation of the contract and an\napplication of the contract. To view that as\notherwise not pre-empted would be to start attacking\n301 in terms of a uniform national system of\nadministering contracts in Federal labor law.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what is -- what is\nthe contractual issue? What is the issue of\ninterpreting the contract that this case presents if\nyou let the 301 case go forward?\nMR. MATHIASON: The issue would be whether\nthe action of engaging in the strike violates the no\nstrike clause of the collective bargaining agreement.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any dispute about\nthat?\nMR. MATHIASON: I think there is a dispute\nabout that. I think there's a dispute about the\nunderlying existence of the contract, and then the --\nthe no-strike clause is complex.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How is that issue still\nalive? Wasn't there an NLRB order in May of '06 that\nsaid -- or directed that the contract become effective\nas of July 2nd?\nMR. MATHIASON: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did anybody appeal that\norder or challenge it?\nMR. MATHIASON: Yes. That order was\nappealed to the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit\naffirmed it. From our perspective, it's a final\ndetermination that July 2nd is the starting date of\nthe contract. However, you still have a formation\nissue.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So did -- but how -- if\nyou lost in your appeal to the Ninth Circuit and the\ncontract is effective July 2nd, what issue remains for\nanybody to decide with respect to contract formation?\nMR. MATHIASON: We --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because there has been a\nfinal adjudication of the question of the effective\ndate of the contract.\nMR. MATHIASON: That's our position. We\nsucceeded on that issue before the Ninth Circuit.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So now the only question\nthat appears to be extant in my mind is whether or not\nthere was a breach of the no-strike clause. So why\nisn't that subject to arbitration by the very terms of\nthe arbitration clause?\nMR. MATHIASON: We agree that that would go\nto arbitration, and it's scheduled to go to\narbitration between the local and the company. The\nsecond question that was brought to play in this\nparticular case is whether the formation question goes\nto an arbitrator or goes to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but what -- there is\nno doubt about the formation, just as Justice\nSotomayor said. There is a contract, the contract\nthat was signed on December 17th. It is formed. You\ndon't doubt that it's formed. They don't doubt that\nit's formed. And that contract has an arbitration\nagreement in it. And one of the questions that will\nbe arbitrated, I take it, is whether that December\n17th contract, because of its retroactivity\nprovisions, provides damages for what happened in\nJuly. And part of that will require the arbitrator to\ninterpret the December 17th contract --\nMR. MATHIASON: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- to decide whether it\ndoes cover that event of July 2nd. Now, what has this\ngot to do -- I mean, I would have thought -- is that\n- I mean, what is your argument?\nMR. MATHIASON: Your Honor, the critical\nissue isn't the NLRB ruling, although that's going to\nhave to be drawn upon. There is a denial that a\ncontract was formed on July 2nd that continues to\ntoday. And the question is: Where does that get\ndecided? Does it get decided in a court, as we did\nbefore with a unanimous jury verdict? Or does that\nnow get vacated and sent to an arbitrator with no\nagreement --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why is there -- is\nthere anything, any question about formation, given\nthat there is a contract? The contract is retroactive\nto May, so if the contract is retroactive to May, then\ncertainly a contract was formed and that issue is --\nis academic, but --\nMR. MATHIASON: You're -- Justice Ginsburg,\nthis is right at the center of the analysis in that we\ncontend, the company, that there was a formation on\nJuly 2nd. The other side contends that something\nhappened on August 22nd that would constitute the\nformation event. There was no -- if our contract --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why does it matter?\nWhy does it matter if we have a contract? A contract\nhas been formed; everybody agrees about that. And\neverybody agrees that the effective date is May.\nMR. MATHIASON: It's of critical importance\nwhich contract was formed, because there's a quid pro\nquo in labor law that's critical, and that is that you\nagree to arbitration in exchange for a no-strike\nclause. That happened on the 2nd. If we had not had\nformation on July 2nd and the first formation was on\nthe 22nd of August, then we would have been denied all\nof the benefit of the contract. We never would have\nmade the same deal.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, why isn't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose it's a\nquestion for your friends on the other side whether\nthey think the ratification or the contract that was\nentered into in December that's effective in May -- if\nthat makes them liable for violating the no-strike\nclause, right?\nMR. MATHIASON: Mr. Chief Justice, there's a\ncritical issue in labor relations, and that is clearly\nwhen it's ratified brings into effect the no-strike\nclause. That's embedded --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what happens if\nit's ratified retroactively? Is the no-strike clause\nin effect?\nMR. MATHIASON: The no --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You want to say yes,\nright?\nMR. MATHIASON: Well, it would be -- it\nwould be completely imprudent for to us say that in\nMay the no-strike clause was in effect. It wasn't,\nbecause the parties were still in a labor dispute and\nnegotiating. July 2nd, that's when the no-strike\nclause came into effect.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think people are not\ncommunicating. Imagine on December 17th you and I\nenter into a contract and it's all written in red, all\nright? And one of these red sentences says: I will\npay you $32 extra an hour from the moment that the\nblue contract went into effect. See?\nNow, whether -- that moment when the blue\ncontract went into effect is a question, isn't it,\nthat we would turn over to the arbitrator, the person\nwho is arbitrating the meaning and application of the\nred contract. That's simply a question of fact and\ncontractual meaning like any other.\nNow, what have I said that's wrong?\nMR. MATHIASON: Your Honor, what's really\ncentral is the fact that when we signed in December,\nwe signed the agreement of July 2nd. That is\ncritical. If there had been no ratification on July\n2nd, there would be no contract. And when the union\nsigned, they take the position that they signed a\ncontract ratified on August 22nd. Those are radically\ndifferent events, and the -- the real issue then is,\nwhere do you determine this core initial issue?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why is that a difficult\nissue? I can easily modify the hypothetical. The red\ncontract says: Joe Smith will be paid $32 extra an\nhour from the moment when this red contract takes\neffect.\nOkay? And, now we have an issue, when\neverybody's agreed, we'll send the meaning of the\ncontract to arbitration. We'll send the application\nof the contract to -- to arbitration. One of the\nquestions is: When, for purposes of the $32, did this\ncontract, which we have admittedly signed, take\neffect? Why isn't that question for an arbitrator?\nIs there any authority at all --\nMR. MATHIASON: Yes --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- anywhere that says it\nisn't -- I can't -- I can't even know what authority\n- what reasoning it would be.\nMR. MATHIASON: Justice Breyer, the second\ncontract, if it's the contract as proposed by the\nother side, never would have had a clause with that\nmuch money in it because we would have had to absorb\nfor the strike. We signed the contract on the\nassumption that it was the contract entered into July\n2nd, and --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Am I correct that neither\nyou, neither Granite Rock nor the local, thinks that\nthe December collective bargaining agreement really\nwas fully retroactive? They don't think it was --\nMR. MATHIASON: That's correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- it meant that the no\nstrike clause was in effect on the day when the old\ncollective bargaining agreement expired, and you don't\nthink that the new arbitration clause was in effect on\nthe day when the old collective bargaining agreement\nexpired, or do I not understand your positions?\nMR. MATHIASON: Justice Alito, that's\nexactly right. We agree with that. It wasn't. I\nmean, there is a crystal-clear understanding between\nthe parties that the time of ratification is the time\nthat the no-strike clause came into effect, and if\nthere was no ratification on July 2nd, we wouldn't\nhave signed the contract with the wage levels that are\ndescribed in December. When we signed it, we signed it\nwith the assumption that it was the contract that was\nformed on July 2nd.\nAnd the issue of formation was never given\nto arbitration. The arbitration clause in this\nparticular case is what arises under the contract.\nIt's a much narrower clause than this Court has seen\nin other cases and was not submitted --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I keep going back\nto: That issue was decided. It was decided by the\nNLRB, and that was affirmed by a court of law, and so\n-- by the Ninth Circuit. I don't understand what the\nextant issue is. The -- the -- now what's left is\napplying that in arbitration to the question of the\neffectiveness of the no-strike clause.\nBut it has nothing to do with whether or not\nthe issue of ratification has been decided and by\nwhom.\nMR. MATHIASON: Justice Sotomayor, we take\nthe position, much like you've indicated in your\nhypothetical or actual description, that the NLRB\ndecision is definitive. But there has to be a body,\nan entity, that actually adjudicates whether this is\npreclusive, and the question is: Does that go to a\ncourt, as it already has, with a unanimous jury\nverdict finding that it was ratified, or does it go to\nan arbitrator, who then looks at the NLRB decision and\nsays, I guess I am bound by it?\nWe never agreed to submit the formation\nquestion to arbitration. There is no clear and\nunmistakable agreement to do that, and so,\nconsequently, it's the forum issue of where that's\ndecided. We couldn't agree more that it's a futile\nact. In other words, the contract is now final and\nover, it starts on July 2nd, and we should go right\ninto the issue of whether there's a breach of\ncontract.\nBut there's this interim step because we\ndon't yet have agreement from the other side that that\nissue is moot and resolved.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If the contract had read,\nnot simply \"claims arising under this contract,\" but\nin addition said \"including the formation or breach\nthereof,\" if the -- if the arbitration clause had\nincluded formation, then you would have no argument.\nMR. MATHIASON: There would be no --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It would go to the\narbitrator.\nMR. MATHIASON: Justice Ginsburg, there's no\nquestion that the parties could agree to have\nformation arbitrated if they do so in a clear and\nunmistakable way. The problem that we have here -- we\nagree with that -- the clause, if -- if the clause\nincluded formation, then that issue would go to the\narbitrator. But the issue then becomes is there a\ncontract? And that's a threshold issue, that you have\nto bring life to the agreement to get subject matter\njurisdiction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought of another way of\nputting this because I am having a hard time with it.\nYou and I could do this, couldn't we? We could try to\nenter into a contract on May 1, and who knows what\nhappens, we disagree about what happened, and by the\nway that had an arbitration clause in it. Now,\nwhether -- since we disagree about it, that would go\nto the judge, whether we formed that contract with its\narbitration clause, because everything's up in the\nair.\nA year later, we enter into another\ncontract, and what that contract says is, we are going\nto arbitrate every dispute between us, including that\nold dispute about whether there was that old contract,\nokay? And we could do that, and then you would -- you\nwould certainly arbitrate the issue of contract\nformation, even for the old one, because we said we\nwould do it, right?\nMR. MATHIASON: If --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So why isn't the\nDecember 17th contract that second contract in respect\nto the July 2nd?\nMR. MATHIASON: Your Honor, if that had\nbeen, let's say, 4 years later, and we entered into a\nnew contract willingly and getting the exchange, the\nno-strike clause for the arbitration, and that new\ncontract said, this is going to deal with all past\ndisputes, including prior contracts, fine.\nWhen we executed that contract in December,\nwe executed the contract that we believed was formed\nin July. There is no meeting of the minds. In other\nwords, the union's execution was on a contract they\nsay was formed on the 22nd.\nThere is a major, major issue here, and that\nis on July 2nd we made the concessions on wages,\nworking conditions, and the rest of it, with the\nexplicit understanding that it would be ratified at\nthat time. Stipulated fact number 16, I think it's in\nthe joint appendix 377, has that qualification in it.\nIf it wasn't ratified on July 2nd, then what\nhappened is it was withdrawn, it exploded, there was\nnothing, there was nothing to be signed in December.\nWe only signed what was agreed to on July 2nd and\nmaintained that position because we believe we got the\nbenefit and the protection of a no-strike clause all\nthe way through that time period.\nAnd so that is the critical distinction.\nAnd now I couldn't agree more with this Court that\nit's an academic exercise to go to either an\narbitrator or a court on whether it is in effect as of\nJuly 2nd. We believe the NLRB decision is preclusive\nin that regard.\nBut there is underneath it, there has to be\na forum. There has to be somebody to say that. If an\narbitrator got the case, looked at it, said, well, I'm\nnot sure I really agree with the NLRB, and I think I'm\ngoing to decide it differently, and that then went to\nreview in a court, and the arbitrator made a mistake\nof law, a mistake of fact, it's not completely clear\nto me that we would be able to come back to this Court\nand get it effectively changed.\nWe are saying that the issue of formation\nwas submitted to the court, it was litigated.\nAnd I would like to very much, Chief\nJustice, reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Bonsall.\nORAL EXAMINATION OF ROBERT BONSALL\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nTEAMSTERS LOCAL 287\nMR. BONSALL: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to turn to some questions that were\njust raised. This is not a question of whether there\nis a contract dated July 2nd, nor is this a question\nof whether there was a contract dated August 22nd.\nThose are issues of contract ratification.\nThere is only one collective bargaining\nagreement. That collective bargaining agreement was\nattached as an exhibit to the employer's first amended\ncomplaint. The trial court recognized this fact, in\njoint appendix page 231.\nThe contract was attached to the -- to the\ncomplaint lodging a breach of contract against this\nlabor organization. There can be no doubt that that\ncollective bargaining agreement says, on the very\nfirst page and the very last page, that the effective\ndate is May 1st, 2004, and its expiration date is\nApril 30th of 2008.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if there was a\ncontract beginning May 22nd, then that included the\nno-strike clause?\nMR. BONSALL: The issue, Your -- Mr. Chief\nJustice, would be whether the parties when they\nentered into that agreement and made that entire\nagreement retroactive to May 1st of 2004, whether the\nparties intended that the retroactivity clause would\napply for all purposes to any disputes arising to the\nparties. For example --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so you don't\nthink -- I guess this is following up on Justice\nAlito's question. You don't think it included the no\nstrike clause --\nMR. BONSALL: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- for -- that would\napply to July 2nd?\nMR. BONSALL: We contend that it would not,\nand here's the reason why. If --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if it doesn't\n-- I'm sorry to interrupt you. But if it doesn't\ninclude the no-strike clause and the question is\nwhether the July 2nd one does, all this talk about the\nDecember agreement being retroactive to May is really\nkind of beside the point.\nMR. BONSALL: Well, I think that it's\nimportant for two reasons. First, factually, if the\nCourt places itself in the position of the parties on\nJuly 1st, at that point in time some things are clear.\nThe union and its members have been out on strike for\napproximately 3 weeks, and they have engaged in tough\nnegotiations at the bargaining table trying to reach a\nnew contract, because that old contract had expired\nalmost 2 months ago. And the parties reach a\ntentative agreement on all the wages, hours, and terms\nof conditions of employment. But then the parties\nalso incorporate a retroactivity clause, to make sure\nthat all these rights and benefits would inure to the\nunion members beginning May 1, the day after the last\ncontract expired.\nThe Court should ask itself that -- when the\nunion and its members are engaging in lawful,\nprotected, concerted activity, a strike, on July 1,\ndid they intend to convert that lawful economic\nactivity into a breach of contract?\nJUSTICE ALITO: And you say no, but what do\nyou say about the -- but you say that the arbitration\nclause was intended to be retroactive.\nMR. BONSALL: Excuse me, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you say that the\narbitration clause -- or do you? -- in the later -- in\nthe agreement that was ratified in December was\nretroactive?\nMR. BONSALL: No, I think --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Neither one is retroactive?\nMR. BONSALL: On July 2nd, as counsel has\nindicated, there is a real dispute, a continuing\ndispute, between the parties whether the contract was\nratified on July 2nd.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, I understand that. I've\nhaving difficulty -- can we just put the December --\nin the view of both sides, can we just put the\nDecember agreement aside? It has nothing to do with\nthe argument that's before us.\nThe argument before us has to do with the --\nwhether there was a ratification on July the 2nd.\nMR. BONSALL: We think that the -- there is\nonly one contract, Your Honor. That contract was\nexecuted on December 14th by management's\nrepresentative and December 17th by the union's\nrepresentative. That's the labor agreement. Now --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- I'm sorry,\nbut that's the central issue. Your friend says no, we\nhad a contract on July 2nd, and that's for the court\nto determine, not the arbitrator, because it's a\nquestion of formation.\nMR. BONSALL: Well, the fact that counsel\nhas reiterated over and over again that this is a\nquestion of contract formation -- in fact there is no\nformation issue when the Court is being asked to\ndecide whether there is an arbitral issue. The Court\nneeds to look at the collective bargaining agreement;\nand the contract that was in effect at the time that\nthe party -- the union -- made its demand for\narbitration clearly indicated that there was a\ncontract in place, and it contained a -- an -- excuse\nme -- extremely broad arbitration provision, that\nrequires that all disputes -- all disputes arising\nunder the collective bargaining agreement would be\nsubject to the grievance and arbitration provision.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the\nunion's initial position was that there was no\nagreement, and it refused to arbitrate. Isn't that\nwhat -- wasn't the union's refusal to arbitrate what\nprecipitated this case?\nMR. BONSALL: That is not correct, Your\nHonor.\nOn July 26th of 2004, the union was\nconfronting a Boys Markets injunction that was being\nsought by the employer. The issue before the trial\ncourt was whether the union should be enjoined, its\nstrike should be enjoined. And counsel for the union\ntook the clear position that there was not a contract\nin place at that time on July 26th, but even if there\nwas, the injunction should not issue because of this\nCourt's decision in Buffalo Forge.\nThe matter that was continuing to be an\nissue in conflict did not arise under the collective\nbargaining agreement because it involved other labor\norganizations and essentially a back-to-work\nagreement. So on July 26th, the union did take the\nposition that there was no contract, but the reason\nwhy an injunction was not appropriate was because of\nBuffalo Forge.\nI don't know if that addresses --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that at that\ntime the union refused to arbitrate.\nMR. BONSALL: No. There was no question\nabout arbitrating anything. The employer didn't ask\nto have arbitration at all at the July 26th hearing.\nThe only question at that point in time was whether\nthere was ratification or not. The employer insisted\nthat the union's representative had made a\ncommunication to the employer's representative that\nthe contract had been ratified.\nHaving the witnesses for both labor and\nmanagement in the courtroom, Judge Ware said, well,\nI'll take evidence regarding whether this\ncommunication occurred. Did George Netto represent to\nBruce Woolpert that in fact a contract had been\nratified?\nThat was the very narrow issue decided by --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, at least now that we\nhave had the NLRB's -- the NLRB has weighed in and\nsaid that there was a contract as of July 2nd, why\nisn't that conclusive?\nMR. BONSALL: We think that there's still an\nissue that is being sent to the arbitrator, the breach\nof contract and damages, but as a precursor to that,\nwe contend that the issue never should have been\nlitigated at all by the trial court about whether\nthere was formation, because there was no question of\nformation at that time. It was only a question of\ncontract ratification, and that issue falls within the\nscope of the broad arbitration provision under the\ncollective bargaining agreement. When we go back --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought you answered\nJustice Alito \"no,\" but I thought his question was a\nvery simple one. You're taking the position, I think,\nthat there's no dispute that on -- in December a\ncontract was formed.\nMR. BONSALL: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It was made retroactive\nto a date before July. It started in May --\nMR. BONSALL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and it covers a time\nframe.\nMR. BONSALL: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The dispute between the\nparties is what that retroactivity under the contract\nmeans and which provisions are in effect or not.\nIsn't that what your argument is -- that this is not\ncontract formation; this is a question of -- of the\napplicability of individual provisions to a set of\nfacts?\nMR. BONSALL: Absolutely correct, Your\nHonor. The employer is alleging that there is a\nbreach of the no-strike clause. The union is alleging\na defense to that allegation by asserting a merits\nbased issue regarding whether, in a certain narrow gap\nperiod, falling in between the effective date of the\ncontract --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your answer to\nJustice Alito should have been: We are arguing that\nthe no-strike clause was not in effect, but we do take\nthe position that the arbitration clause was --\nMR. BONSALL: That's --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- made retroactive.\nMR. BONSALL: That's exactly correct, Your\nHonor. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what do you\nexpect the arbitrator to do? The arbitrator -- since\nyou agree that there's a contract in effect --\nMR. BONSALL: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the arbitrator is\nnot going to decide whether the contract is there or\nnot.\nMR. BONSALL: He will not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the contract has\na no-strike clause.\nMR. BONSALL: That's correct, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you expect the\narbitrator to say you get the benefit of the contract\nthat lets me decide something, and even though there's\na no-strike clause in the contract, you want the\narbitrator to say that no-strike clause is not\noperative on July 2nd?\nMR. BONSALL: We expect the arbitrator to\ntake a look at the facts that existed on July 2nd and\nmake a determination whether in fact at that point in\ntime the union has a meritorious claim that the\ncontract was not ratified, and therefore the no-strike\nclause --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though -- I'm\nsorry to interrupt you. But even though the later\nagreement was that it would be retroactive?\nMR. BONSALL: Absolutely. Both parties\nopenly negotiated and hammered out and had their\nrepresentatives sign a collective bargaining\nagreement. The employer was entirely free, if it was\ninclined to do so, to suggest that they would not sign\nan agreement unless the union consented.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So in substance, you -- you\nthink that the arbitrator would decide the issue of\ncontract formation, whether --\nMR. BONSALL: No.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I thought you just\nsaid that the arbitrator would decide whether there\nwas an agreement on July the 2nd.\nMR. BONSALL: The arbitrator would not be\ndeciding contract formation. The arbitrator would be\ndeciding within the scope of the collective bargaining\nagreement whether the no-strike clause was effective\nto bind the employer -- excuse me -- to bind the union\nfrom a short period of time from July 2nd to August\n22nd. That would be the only real claim, because the\nunion actually -- there's no question -- was out on\nstrike. This is not in dispute.\nWhat the trial court did in this case was to\nusurp the function of the arbitrator. The parties\nselected one arbitrator.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, perhaps you can\nclarify one thing for me. I thought that these two go\ntogether -- two things that go together: One is the\nno-strike clause, and one is the arbitration clause.\nMR. BONSALL: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you are trying to\nuncouple them, and so, even though one is quid pro quo\nfor the other, you would say the union wants to keep\nwhat favors it, that is the arbitration clause, but\nreject what favors the employer, that is the no-strike\nclause.\nIt seems to me that if you have one, you\nhave the other, but you can't say, oh, yes, we have\nthe arbitration clause, but we don't have the no\nstrike clause.\nMR. BONSALL: Yes, I -- I think this Court\nhas addressed that very issue, Justice Ginsburg, in\nDrake Bakeries. An employer was confronted with a\nstrike. The employer immediately went into Federal\ncourt and filed a breach of contract action against\nthe labor organization, and it insisted that these two\ncontract provisions, the right -- the no-strike clause\nand the grievance procedure, were inextricably tied.\nAnd this Court pointed out that they are not in all\ncircumstances exact counterweights.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they're not in all\ncircumstances, but will you respond to your opponent's\nargument? Why in the world would they have signed on\n-- on July 2nd if they didn't think they were going to\nget the benefit of the no-strike clause?\nMR. BONSALL: When they signed the\nagreement, Your Honor, they absolutely did get the\nbenefit of it. There was no strike at all after\nAugust 22nd that was --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If they had the benefit of\nthe no-strike clause --\nMR. BONSALL: -- in violation of the\ncollective bargaining agreement.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- then any subsequent\nstrike would have violated the contract?\nMR. BONSALL: Absolutely. If there was a\nsubsequent strike at any time in --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, there was a\nsubsequent strike.\nMR. BONSALL: There was not, Your Honor.\nAfter -- after --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that an issue for\nthe arbitrator? Now that we know there was an\nagreement on July 2nd, is the question whether the\nstrike continued or not for the arbitrator?\nMR. BONSALL: I'm not sure that I understand\nyour question. The -- I think the arbitrator will be\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you say there\nwas no strike, and I -- I thought the other side said\nthere was.\nMR. BONSALL: There absolutely was a strike.\nIt began in the early weeks of June.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. BONSALL: And it continued, actually,\nthrough September 22nd of 2004. That was the duration\nthat the union was on strike.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, but their\nposition is that there was a contract on July 2nd that\nincluded a no-strike clause --\nMR. BONSALL: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that you\nviolated.\nMR. BONSALL: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. And your\nanswer is, one, that there is no contract, right?\nMR. BONSALL: Our defense to the allegation\nof the no-strike clause before the arbitrator would be\nthat at that time the parties had not ratified the\nagreement, and that ratification did not occur until\nAugust 22nd, which also appears as a concession by the\nemployer in paragraph 27 of their third amended\ncomplaint. They also say that the contract was\nratified on August 22nd.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But that would be an issue\nfor the -- you think that that would be an issue for\nthe arbitrator to decide, whether there was a contract\nratified on July the 2nd?\nMR. BONSALL: Or August 22nd, yes, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And if the arbitrator\nthought that it was in existence on July 2nd, then --\nMR. BONSALL: Then --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- you would lose?\nMR. BONSALL: I think that's correct, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So that's an issue of\ncontract formation; is it not? In substance it is.\nMR. BONSALL: If I may finish?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, sure.\nMR. BONSALL: In substance it's contract\nformation if you can place yourself back in time on\nJuly 2nd or August 22nd. It is moot and entirely\nacademic when the parties ratify an agreement at some\npoint in time and sign the contract in December.\nThere is no question of contract formation in this\ncase. There's only a question of contract\nratification during a very narrow period.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that -- and that\nposition depends upon your answer to Justice\nGinsburg's question, that you are severing arbitration\nand the no-strike obligation?\nMR. BONSALL: Under Drake Bakeries, we do\nnot believe that we are severing at all. We think\nthat when an employer brings a breach of contract\nclaim in Federal court under a collective bargaining\nagreement that contains a broad arbitration clause,\ntheir remedy is to seek that breach of contract and\ndamage claim before the arbitrator.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. BONSALL: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Nussbaum.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. NUSSBAUM\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nINTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS\nMR. NUSSBAUM: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThere are three basic points that I would\nlike to discuss with the Court this morning with\nregard to the section 301 issue.\nThe first is that, in our view, the issue as\nto whether or not a tort claim can be brought under\n301 begins and ends with the clear language of section\n301, which talks about suits for violation of\ncontract.\nThe second point I'd like to make is that\nallowing the tort action, as Granite Rock is urging,\nwould work a big change in the structure that Congress\nhas established by which it has decided that major\nissues of labor law, such as the weapons -- economic\nweapons that parties can use, should be decided by\nCongress through statute and by the National Labor\nRelations Board through the application of the\nstatute.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you take the position\nthat the cause of action for interference with a\ncontract has been pre-empted insofar as State law is\nconcerned?\nMR. NUSSBAUM: That's, of course, not an\nissue in this case because it was never attempted --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What is your position on\nthat point?\nMR. NUSSBAUM: The law in most of the\ncircuits is that any case which involves the\ninterpretation of a contract is pre-empted. I'm not\nsure that this Court has --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you -- do you -- does\nyour client take the position that that law is\ncorrect, that the Federal law has pre-empted State law\nactions for interference with -- with contract\nrelations?\nMR. NUSSBAUM: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So then you\nare submitting to this Court that the purpose of the\nNational Relation -- Labor Relations Act and its\neffect was to give immunity to unions for intentional\ninterference with contractual relations?\nMR. NUSSBAUM: No, that is not what I\nbelieve happened.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, isn't that the\neffect of your argument here?\nMR. NUSSBAUM: No, I do not believe it is.\nLet me just first clarify something, that the pre\nemption of State torts is not dependent on section\n301. State torts for interference with contract would\nhave been pre-empted prior, under Garmon or Machinists\npre-emption, because of those two doctrines, that it\nwould interfere with conduct that is arguably\nprohibited or arguably protected, or that it is in an\narea unregulated by Congress. But it doesn't leave\nthe employer remediless in a situation like this, far\nfrom it.\nThis employer had a breach of contract\naction under the contract that it is pursuing --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not against the\ninternational?\nMR. NUSSBAUM: Not against the\ninternational. That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If it's true -- if it's\ntrue, which we can take for purposes -- for the\ncurrent purpose, that the international really did\ninduce the local to continue the strike, you said\nthere's no action in State court because that's pre\nempted. Unfair labor practice proceedings is against\nthe local, not the -- not the international. So\nthere's nothing.\nIt is in your view, you -- you said, well,\nthere's relief against the local, but there's no\nremedy at all against the international, even if the\nallegation is true that this strike would never have\noccurred if it hadn't been for the pressure from the\ninternational.\nMR. NUSSBAUM: No, I disagree. There is an\navenue that Granite Rock could have pursued but did\nnot pursue, and that was to have filed a charge\nagainst the international with the National Labor\nRelations Board, which is the body that should be\nmaking this precise decision as to whether this action\nby the international, an economic weapon, is\npermissible or is outlawed by the National Labor\nRelations Act. Granite Rock chose not to file an\nunfair labor practice, but it could have.\nAnd we cited -- it's cited, actually, in the\namicus brief by the AFL-CIO, the Paperworkers case,\nwhich demonstrates that an international union that\ninterferes with the bargaining of local unions can\nitself be guilty of an unfair labor practice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I'd like\nyour broader perspective as a representative of the\ninternational, because I think it's an important issue\nof labor policy. If I think that the cause of actions\navailable under 301(a) and the pre-emptive effect of\n301(a) ought to be coextensive, which -- which do you\nprefer, a broader 301(a) or a narrower pre-emption? I\nthink it makes a difference.\nMR. NUSSBAUM: I'm not -- I'm sorry -- I'm\nnot sure I understand the question.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think 301 -- I\nthink whatever -- I don't think there should be a no\nman's land between you can bring your action under 301\nand it's pre-empted by 301.\nIn other words, if -- if you are right, that\nthey cannot bring a tortious interference action under\n301, I don't think it should be pre-empted. If you\nare wrong and they can bring it, then I can understand\nthat it should be pre-empted.\nMR. NUSSBAUM: Let me -- let me try to\nanswer your question, as I'm -- as I'm understanding\nit. First, the issue as to whether or not they could\nbring a 301 action under -- a tort action under 301,\nit was not pre-empted by 301.\nThe question is whether 301 allows that type\nof claim at all, whether Congress intended that, and I\nthink the language of the statute, violation of\ncontract, indicates no, because a violation of\ncontract, you can only violate a contract against --\nbring an action against someone who --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it was pre-empted\nby 301, and they cannot bring it under 301?\nMR. NUSSBAUM: Not a Federal court claim\nunder 301.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. NUSSBAUM: A State claim, a State tort\naction under 301, would be pre-empted. What will\nhappen then is -- is similar to what happened in the\n- in the Rawson case. What happens if a State court\ntort is brought?\nIt would be pre-empted because of complete\npre-emption because it involves a contract and the\ninterpretation of a contract. That doesn't mean that\nthe -- that it's gone. What the Federal court does\nthen is look at the claim and say, with what was pled\nin the complaint, does that fall within the parameters\nof 301? And that's exactly what the Court did in\nRawson. It said the State court tort action was pre\nempted. Now, we have to look and see, is there a\nclaim under 301?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so if Granite\nRock brought this claim in State court, you would say\nit's pre-empted by 301?\nMR. NUSSBAUM: Yes, but we'd be in exactly\nthe same position.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then, if they\nturned around and brought it in Federal court under\n301, you would say, no, there is no cause of action\nunder 301?\nMR. NUSSBAUM: Yes, you would get to the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMR. NUSSBAUM: You would get to the same\nresult, and the process is exactly the same.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it is in a no\nman's land. Their claim for tortious interference\nwith contract just can't be brought anywhere?\nMR. NUSSBAUM: It -- it -- for tortious\ninterference, no, you cannot -- you cannot bring that\nclaim, but what I was saying before is, it doesn't\nleave them remediless, even with regard to a claim\nagainst the international because a charge could be\nfiled --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They could always go\nto the NLRB --\nMR. NUSSBAUM: -- under 8(b)(3), and the\nboard would decide, the -- the conduct in this\ncontext, and the board is always looking at the\ncontext of it, is this something which is prohibited,\nsomething which is protected, something which is\nunregulated? And it is the board that Congress\nentrusted that -- that job to.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What remedies -- I'm\nsorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What is the remedy --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Just before you finish,\nChief, is it all right if you -- I'm not quite clear\non how this pre-emption works, and I perhaps didn't\nhave it right. But imagine 301 had never been\nenacted. I thought, had that never been enacted,\ncertain kinds of State claims, particularly tort\nclaims of interference with labor contracts, for\nexample, might have been pre-empted anyway by the\nLabor Relations -- by the -- by the LMRA.\nI thought that did the basic pre-emptive\njob. And then where it is pre-empted by the LMRA, 301\ncreates an exception to the pre-emption, so that it\nisn't pre-empted, if you have a suit. Now, my\nthinking is probably out-of-date and wrong, so I would\nlike you to explain how it works.\nMR. NUSSBAUM: I -- I think perhaps we are\nsaying the same thing --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, because I think\nthat your response to the Chief Justice's question,\nwhich is why I became uncertain, is that it is the\nLMRA -- not the LMRA at all that pre-empts tort\nactions and State activities that interfere with labor\nrelations, as this might. It is, rather, section 301\nitself that pre-empts it, and then it is odd because\nit pre-empts it, but it says, we won't give you any,\nand -- and that's why I became uncertain.\nMR. NUSSBAUM: Let me try because I think I\nunderstand why I confused you. I think, before 301, a\ntort action would have been pre-empted by either the\ndoctrines of Garmon pre-emption or Machinists pre\nemption.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In State court or in\nFederal court?\nMR. NUSSBAUM: In -- in State court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you bring it in\nFederal court?\nMR. NUSSBAUM: No -- well, no, it would have\nbeen -- it would have been pre-empted in Federal court\nalso. It would have been within the primary\njurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board.\nThat's where -- who it goes to.\nWhat I think has happened, Justice Breyer,\nis, since the enactment of 301, and particularly with\nthis Court's doctrine of complete pre-emption for\nremoval purposes, which I know there's some debate\nabout, when courts look at State law torts, they tend\nto look at 301, rather than going back to Garmon and\nMachinists pre-emption.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you, what is the\nremedy for an unfair labor practice? Can they get a\ndamage remedy?\nMR. NUSSBAUM: Yes. It would be, first, a\ncease-and-desist order.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. NUSSBAUM: And then a make-whole remedy.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: A make-whole remedy --\nMR. NUSSBAUM: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- for -- okay.\nMR. NUSSBAUM: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What would the make\nwhole -- I gather a cease-and-desist wouldn't make any\nsense because this is over, but what would the make\nwhole remedy entail?\nMR. NUSSBAUM: It would have to be a proof\nof damages that resulted from the unfair labor\npractice, from the unfair conduct, which, in this\nsituation, would have been the interference into the\nbargaining process. And how the NLRB would decide\nwhat the damages would be, for the international as\nopposed to the local union, I'm really not sure, but\nthere is certainly the capacity under the NLRA for\nthere to be a make-whole remedy.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you -- while saying that\nthere's no cause of action for this tort claim, you\nnonetheless say that the tort claim can be considered\nan unfair labor practice by the labor board. Why does\nthat make any sense?\nMR. NUSSBAUM: Because what Congress -- what\nCongress did in 301 was to create limited jurisdiction\nfor one type of claim and one type of claim only,\nviolation of contract, breach of contract, an action\nagainst the party that has the obligations under it.\nBut that doesn't mean that there isn't any\nclaim outside of 301 against a third party. In this\ncase, the third party is the international, and the\nclaim could be made under the National Labor Relations\nAct. The Paperworker case is an example.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if it's outside 301,\nwhere does pre-emption come from, Garmon?\nMR. NUSSBAUM: The pre-emption -- well, in\nthis case --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If I could interrupt just\nfor a moment? Allis-Chalmers was 301. Allis-Chalmers\nsays 301 covers contract, and, therefore, there's a\npre-emption. So I take it you're not talking about\nAllis-Chalmers pre-emption. You are talking about\nGarmon or Machinists or something.\nMR. NUSSBAUM: Well, both of them end up\npre-empting a State law tort. In this case --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if you say both of\nthem, then we're back where we started. If 301 pre\nempts, then it should be within the ambit of 301's\njurisdiction to the Federal court.\nMR. NUSSBAUM: No, it pre-empts exactly for\nthe purpose that this is an issue that should be\ndecided by the regulatory agency, which Congress\nentrusted with making exactly these decisions. What\neconomic weapons can an international union, can a\nparent employer use in a labor dispute?\nFor the courts to be getting involved in\nthat would be directly contrary to what Congress has\nbeen doing since 1935, of saying those decisions of\neconomic weapons are not to be decided by courts\napplying common law tort principles. We tried that,\nand we didn't like it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that\napplies in 301. They're not touching the contract.\nThey're not touching the parties to the contract.\nThis is outside the contract. So why should it be\npre-empted?\nMR. NUSSBAUM: It's -- well, again, the\nclaim that they brought in Federal court was not pre\nempted. It was a claim. You looked at the claim.\nYou read the complaint, and you said, you don't have a\nclaim under 301 because it's not one for violation of\ncontract, good-bye.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand that.\nMR. NUSSBAUM: End of it. The question that\nJustice Kennedy was -- was addressing to me was: Does\nthat leave them without any remedy? And my answer is,\nno, it doesn't. Aside from the remedies they have\nagainst the local, they also had a potential remedy\nagainst the international through the National Labor\nRelations Act.\nAnd that -- that was the basic point that I\nwas making.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Has -- has the board, in\nfact, declared a party who is not a party to the labor\ncontract guilty of an unfair labor practice in prior\ncases?\nMR. NUSSBAUM: The Paperworkers case that we\ncite -- the answer to your question is: I'm not aware\nof a case. The one we cited, the international was a\nparty to the case. However, it's clear that the fact\nthat it was a party to the case was not the\ndeterminative factor, because what the NLRB did was\ninstruct the international union to strike the pooled\nvoting provision that was in the constitution.\nSo they didn't say: It's just no good in\nthis case where you are a party to the contract. They\nsaid: You can't do it in any situation. That clearly\nshowed that the -- that the NLRB was focusing on the\nbroader type of interference where they didn't have to\nbe a party to the contract.\nBut even if the NLRB -- and I want to stress\nthis -- were to find that there wasn't a remedy under\nthe -- the facts of the particular case, that would\nsimply mean that it is protected conduct under the\nNational Labor Relations Act. And the NLRB has made\nthat decision, and it is the agency that should be\ndoing it, rather than having courts get involved in\nthis area of law making up rules, because when you\ntalk about interference, as we know, the tort isn't\nfor all interference; it's for improper interference.\nAs the Associated General Contractors\nindicates, that would call into play the courts\nlooking at various factors such as societal values,\nand that's exactly what Congress didn't intend.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. NUSSBAUM: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Mathiason, you\nhave 5 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARRY G. MATHIASON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MATHIASON: Categorically, Your Honor,\nthe NLRB has no jurisdiction over this case. In\nfootnote 18 of our reply brief, we recount the\nhistory. That Paperworkers' case that was just\nreferenced, the international was a signatory. It was\nthe exclusive bargaining representative, and,\ntherefore, it had status under section 8(b)(3).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Where is\nthat again? Footnote 18?\nMR. MATHIASON: It's footnote 18 of our\nreply brief, and we recount the history that was\nlitigated both at the Ninth Circuit and beyond. There\nis no remedy before the NLRB --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that may be, but then\nyou might have -- then you'd have a remedy in State\ncourt. I think the argument was that -- anyway, I\nhave this argument: 301 doesn't pre-empt anything but\nthe contract claim.\nNow, go bring your claim in State court.\nYou might have a good claim in State court that isn't\npre-empted. Suppose one of their employees hit\nsomebody over the head. You'd have a great claim, and\nthat isn't going to be pre-empted. Now, yours might\nbe, because there is a set of tort actions in State\ncourt that the labor acts pre-empt; in particular,\nthose that involve conduct that is arguably protected\nor arguably forbidden by the labor acts.\nSo, if you fall outside that category, you\nare not pre-empted. And if you fall inside the\ncategory, you should be pre-empted; not by 301, but by\nthe labor law which gave this kind of decision to the\nlabor board to make. What is -- is that argument\nsensible? Is it right? What do you think?\nMR. MATHIASON: Justice Breyer, there is a\nfundamental aspect of that that's just not right, and\nthat is that the conduct involved here was causing a\nviolation of a contract. The international took\ncontrol of the local and forced the breach. This is\nthe -- this conduct would never be sanctioned if the\njurisdiction of the NLRB had access to it, but the --\nwisely, I think, the structure of the National Labor\nRelations Board is -- the 8(b)(3) remedy is against an\nexclusive agent. They have to be the bargaining\nagent. International is not the bargaining agent.\nAnd so, consequently, if we accepted the position\nof the international, you would create a no-man's zone\nthat would apply throughout this country, whereby\ncollective bargaining agreements entered into by\nlocals could be destroyed, violated, by an\ninternational that would choose to impose itself on\nthe local and cause that to happen. Most\ninternationals are responsible.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you seriously think\nthat if that becomes a problem, that the NLRB won't\ndeclare it an unfair labor practice, or if they don't,\nthat they won't go to Congress and say: There is a\nno-man's land; now give a remedy like you did in 301?\nYou're -- you're begging Justice Breyer's\nquestion, which is: If the law pre-empts this claim\nand it's doing so unjustly, who should make that\ndetermination? Should it be you in a State court, you\nin a Federal court, or should it be in the first\ninstance the NLRB who says this is or isn't an unfair\nlabor practice, and if it rules it's not because the\nlaw doesn't cover it, or it's not authorized to issue\nthis --\nMR. MATHIASON: Your -- Your Honor, I think\nit's well-established this is not an unfair labor\npractice, because you don't have jurisdiction under\nsection 8(b)(3).\nWhat is suggested here is that maybe there\nis a no-man's zone that Congress should go to and\nregulate, but if you back up to 1947 and the passage\nof section 301, it's inconceivable that in passing\nthat statute Congress intended to leave all\ninternational unions, or anybody that controlled a\nparty, completely free from any reach of law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why isn't it under\n8(b)(3)? How does 8(b)(3) read? What is it in\n8(b)(3) that would exclude this from the labor board's\n--\nMR. MATHIASON: Well, it is not an exclusive\nrepresentative. In other words, 8(b)(3) contemplates\na bargaining obligation on the part of an exclusive\nrepresentative, and the international is not in that\ncapacity.\nThey had control, but they aren't designated\nin that manner, and there's not one NLRB case in the\nhistory of that agency that deviates from that, or we\nwould have been on it immediately. And it just isn't\nthere.\nSo we were looking at our options, and State\ncourt appeared to be very clearly pre-empted by Allis-\nChalmers and a row of cases. So that meant that the\nFederal law, section 301, as suggested by Lincoln\nMills, would absorb.\nPlease recognize that what we are seeking\nhere -- the labels of tort and contract create, I\nthink, a false distinction. We are effectively\nbringing a contract action for violation of a\ncontract. The linkage is strictly to add in the\ninternational as the acting party.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
