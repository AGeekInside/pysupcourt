OLSON, ESQ.\nOn behalf of the Petitioners 54\n(10:13 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in Number 01-1491, Charles DeMore versus Hyung Joon\nKim.\nGeneral Olson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nBased upon years of experience, study, hearings,\nand overwhelming persuasive evidence, Congress concluded\nthat the prompt removal of aliens convicted of committing\nserious felonies was essential to the Nation's ability to\ncontrol its borders.\nremoval proceedings was considered vital by Congress to\neffectuate that policy, to prevent flight, to evade\nremoval, and to prevent harm done by recidivist criminal\naliens.\nThis is a facial substantive due process\nchallenge which cannot succeed unless there are no sets\nof -- no set of circumstances under which the\ncongressional policy would be constitutional.\nAs this Court has repeatedly --\nQUESTION: General Olson, do -- do we have\nauthority to entertain this challenge? As you know, an\namicus has raised a jurisdictional question, and I think\ndid it maybe in the court of appeals stage as well. It\ncertainly did it early on here.\nThe problem is section 1126(e) which says, no\ncourt may set aside any action or decision by the Attorney\nGeneral under this section regarding the detention or\nrelease of any alien or the grant, revocation, or denial\nof bond or parole. Now, is that provision, number one,\ninapplicable or, number two, unconstitutional? And if\nneither of those, why doesn't it mean that we have no\nauthority to entertain this case?\nMR. OLSON: Justice Scalia, it's the\nGovernment's position, as held by three courts of appeals,\nthat that provision does not apply to a habeas corpus\nchallenge to the constitutionality of the statute itself,\nthat the language of that provision relates to challenges\nto an action by the Attorney General or administrative\naction and does not preclude a challenge.\nQUESTION: No. It doesn't -- doesn't say the\nchallenge -- no. It says, no court may set aside any\naction by the Attorney General. And -- and what is asked\nfor here is that we set aside the Attorney General's\naction in detailing -- in detaining this alien.\nMR. OLSON: It's -- it's our submission, after\ncareful examination -- the Government originally took that\nposition that you've suggested in court proceedings. It\nwas rejected by three courts of appeals. We studied it\nfurther. The Government studied it further and came to\nthe conclusion that those decisions were correct and it\nwould not preclude -- and we're not contending here\ntoday --\nQUESTION: And -- and you're relying on what\nlanguage to --\nMR. OLSON: Well, we're relying on the language\nthat it refers to, and a reasonable construction of the\nstatute refers to actions, administrative actions, by the\nAttorney General or immigration -- administrative action\nby administrative officials, and this Court's construction\nof statutes against precluding constitutional challenges\nto other statutes.\nQUESTION: Oh, but all of those other statutes\nhad some wiggle room I think, even St. Cyr, and there just\nis no wiggle room here. It doesn't refer to judicial\nreview. It simply says, no court may set aside any action\nby the Attorney General under this section.\nQUESTION: Even in the Quirin case where the --\nthe presidential order said that the people shall have no\naccess to the courts at all, this Court sat to hear\nwhether that sort of a provision was constitutional or\nnot.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand while it would be in the Government's interest to\npreclude this challenge at all, we think a fair reading of\nthe Court's decisions, including the -- the Court -- the\ndecision that the Chief Justice mentioned, would to --\nwould be to construe that statute as not to preclude this\naction in this case. Of course, that would lead -- your\nconstruction would lead to a -- a victory on behalf of the\nGovernment in this case, but we've carefully examined it,\nand we think that we're not advocating that position here\ntoday.\nQUESTION: Well, I appreciate your carefully\nexamining it, but I'd still like to know what language in\nit leads your careful examination to conclude that it does\nnot cover this case. I mean, if it's unconstitutional,\nthat's another matter.\nMR. OLSON: Well, we -- we may be --\nQUESTION: Maybe we'll strike it down for that\nreason. But my goodness --\nMR. OLSON: We -- we may be wrong, Justice\nScalia, but we're referring to and relying on the second\nsentence which says, no court may set aside any action or\ndecision by the Attorney General under this section. It\ndoes not state -- and -- and we think the Court would\nconstrue it as not precluding a challenge to the\nconstitutionality of the -- of the policy made by the\nCongress itself in enacting --\nQUESTION: It doesn't refer to the issue. It\ndoesn't refer to the basis on which the setting aside is\ndone. It doesn't say, may set aside, you know, on grounds\nother than -- it doesn't even refer to the basis. It\nsays, no court may set aside any action by the --\nMR. OLSON: I understand, Justice Scalia, and\nthe Government did, indeed, make that assertion, take that\nposition in early proceedings in this case. It was\nrejected by three courts of appeals. We came to a\ndifferent conclusion after reexamining it, and that's our\nposition here today.\nAs this Court has repeatedly stated, Congress\nhas exceedingly broad latitude in dealing with aliens,\nimmigration, and the Nation's borders.\nQUESTION: Can I have a quick answer just to --\nyou said a facial challenge. I've been assuming that it's\na challenge brought by a resident alien who himself has a\nplausible claim that the statute doesn't apply to him\nbecause he's saying two -- you know, petty theft with a --\npetty theft with a prior is not -- doesn't fall within the\ncategory of crimes. I don't know if that's right or\nwrong, but shouldn't I consider the case of a person who\nhas a -- an arguable claim that he's outside the system?\nMR. OLSON: Well, Justice Breyer, the -- the\ncase has not been litigated on that basis from its very\nbeginning. I refer the Court to page 9 of the joint\nappendix which is -- which, at the bottom of that section,\narticulates the requested relief by the -- by the\nrespondent in this case. Petitioner seeks a declaration\nthat this provision is unconstitutional on its face as\nviolative --\nQUESTION: It uses those words, I know. I just\ndon't know how to consider it that way. I mean, a person\nwho had no claim whatsoever -- am I supposed to consider\nit on the basis of a person who has -- well, he would get\nthe removal order entered in 24 hours if he had no claim\nwhatsoever.\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nQUESTION: Is that who I'm supposed to consider?\nMR. OLSON: Well, it --\nQUESTION: -- or somebody like the plaintiff\nhere?\nMR. OLSON: If this -- not only is it in the\npetition for habeas corpus that the individual was\nchallenging on its face, the district court considered it\non that basis, and the Ninth Circuit considered it on that\nbasis, and it's been litigated here all the way through by\nthe -- by the respondent on that basis. If there was to\nbe an as-applied challenge, there would be a great deal of\nother considerations.\nAnd -- and this -- as this Court has said, the\nfacial challenge must be rejected unless there are no set\nof circumstances under which the congressional policy\nwould be upheld.\nQUESTION: General Olson, didn't --\nMR. OLSON: There -- there's been no --\nQUESTION: -- didn't the Ninth Circuit narrow\nthe group somewhat? I thought that in the district court,\nthe district court said the whole thing falls. I thought\nthe Ninth Circuit said only as to lawfully admitted --\nwhat was it? Lawful permanent residents. And so that was\nnot taking the whole thing at its face, but only a part of\nthe total group.\nQUESTION: I had the same question. It's at 6a\nof the petition for the appendix. The court of appeals,\nin the paragraph at the bottom of 6a, says we stop short\nof affirming the holding that it's facially\nunconstitutional.\nQUESTION: Right.\nQUESTION: We affirm the grant of habeas corpus\non the ground the statute is unconstitutional as applied\nto him in his status as a lawful permanent resident of the\nUnited States.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, and the Ninth Circuit -- the\nNinth Circuit did say that both on page 6 -- 6a and -- and\non page 30a. But what -- what the Ninth Circuit did was\nissue a broad, sweeping declaration of unconstitutionality\nof the statute with respect to a broad class of\nindividuals, that is to say, all lawful permanent\nresidents. That's the equivalent of a facial decision as\nto unconstitutionality as to a broad spectrum of the\npeople covered. And -- and --\nQUESTION: So it's your position, in effect,\nthat although the Ninth Circuit said it was an applied\nchallenge, in fact the Ninth Circuit itself struck it\nfacially.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, Justice --\nQUESTION: It just narrowed the description of\nwhat it did. Is that right?\nMR. OLSON: That's -- that is correct, Justice\nO'Connor. That's --\nQUESTION: But it -- but it struck it facially\nonly with respect to the permanent resident aliens.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct.\nQUESTION: To permanent resident aliens.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Sort of half-facial.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: Mostly facial.\nQUESTION: Mostly facial.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: That's -- that is what the Ninth\nCircuit did, and it's our position that this -- this case\nmust be considered under those circumstances as a facial\nchallenge.\nAs I was saying, the Court has repeatedly said\nthat in connection with immigration and protecting the\nNation's borders, there is no power at which there is more\ndeference to congressional judgment, no authority under\nthe Constitution granted more to the political branches,\nparticularly to Congress. Congress regularly makes rules,\nthis Court has said, applicable to aliens that would be\nunacceptable if applied to citizens.\nQUESTION: Is there a regulation or -- or is\nthere a policy with -- in the Department of Justice or the\nINS which says that there has to be a conviction before\nyou utilize this section? Or if the Attorney General just\nhas information that a felony has been committed, is that\nsufficient to detain?\nMR. OLSON: Well, the statute --\nQUESTION: Here there was a conviction.\nMR. OLSON: Here there was a conviction, and\nthat is specifically what is said in the statute itself.\nIt's my understanding --\nQUESTION: Well, the statute itself talks about\na conviction.\nMR. OLSON: Absolutely. And -- and what happens\nin practice, Justice Kennedy, is that either the removal\nproceeding is brought, as Congress has suggested, if\npossible, during the period of incarceration of the\nindividual, or immediately upon release from\nincarceration.\nSo we were talking, to summarize, a -- this --\nthis provision under 1226(c) applies only to the period of\nthe removal proceeding itself, which was carefully\ndistinguished by this Court in its Zadvydas decision of\n2 years ago.\ndecision, not an unlimited, potentially permanent\ndetention period, what, as the Court suggested in -- in a\ndistinguishable situation a number of years -- years ago\nin the Carlson case involving members of the Communist\nParty, a temporary, limited detention for the purpose of\nkeeping the individual in custody, an individual who's had\na full panoply of due process, having been convicted\nbeyond a reasonable doubt with full due process of --\nQUESTION: Yes, but General, it is true, is it\nnot, that there are people in the class who might have\nbeen convicted even before the statute was passed. So\nyou're not just -- just continuing detention. You have to\ngo out and find them and -- and put them under detention.\nMR. OLSON: It's my understanding, Justice\nStevens, that it applies to convictions after the statute\nwas passed. I may be misunderstanding that, and if so,\nI'll try to correct that during -- during rebuttal. But\nthat to the vast -- that would all -- to the extent that\nthat might be true and I might be mistaken, that would\nonly illustrate why this is a facial challenge. The\nstatute itself should not be declared unconstitutional,\nparticularly in connection with individuals convicted\nafterwards.\nQUESTION: What -- what about this particular\nindividual?\nMR. OLSON: This was after the statute was\npassed, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: General Olson, you've -- you've put\nin statistics about the number of -- of aliens who don't\nshow up for the hearings and the -- the rather low\npercentage of those who are ultimately deported from the\nclass that don't show up and so on.\nOn your view of the Government's authority\nover -- over aliens and the deference that the Court owes,\nwould our -- in your judgment should our decision be the\nsame regardless of those statistics? If you had told us\nnothing about the -- the probabilities of catching people,\nshould we, on your view, or would we, on your view, be\nobligated to defer and simply say it's up to the\nGovernment?\nMR. OLSON: Well, I think Justice Souter, the\nanswer to that is that the test that the Court has\nconsistently applied in this area is there -- is there a\nrational basis, is the congressional objective rationally\nlikely to advance a legitimate governmental purpose.\nThose statistics that we set forth in our brief and which\nwere before Congress when Congress enacted this statute,\nprovide the purpose for which Congress acted.\nQUESTION: Well -- well, is that rational basis\nreview the one we would employ in reviewing legislation\npassed by Congress concerning immigration policy? And\nhave we applied a more circumscribed review over the means\nof effectuating those policies? Are -- are there separate\nquestions? I mean, the power of Congress to pass the law\nand to say what it does versus the implementation of it.\nMR. OLSON: Well, under certain circumstances,\nthe Court has used that language.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. OLSON: The -- the means to achieve the\nobjective --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: -- will be looked at possibly\nseparately.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: But it seems to me -- and it seems\nobvious particularly in this case -- that the means are\nwrapped up in the objective itself.\nWhat -- it is clear Congress is dealing with a\nvery difficult problem of a certain category or groups of\naliens that were committing serious crimes in this\ncountry.\nQUESTION: Well, does -- is -- does that -- do\nyour statistics define that category as the -- the legal\npermanent resident aliens or all aliens? I think it's the\nlatter.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it is -- yes, Justice Souter,\nit's all.\nQUESTION: But if it -- if it is the latter,\nthen I don't know that the statistics tell us anything one\nway or the other about the legitimacy of the ends, i.e.,\nthe -- the automatic detention, with -- with respect to\nthe class that we've got under consideration here.\nMR. OLSON: What the statistics tell us is that\nthere were large numbers of aliens committing serious\ncrimes and that those -- those individuals committing\nthose crimes were highly likely to be recidivists and that\nthey were -- that class of individuals or those groups of\nindividuals were cultivating a criminal class that was\nengaging in organized --\nQUESTION: But, General Olson, those statistics\ngo to the likelihood of entry of the order of deportation,\nnot of the likelihood of flight which this statute is\ndirected at.\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nQUESTION: As I understand the statistics --\ncorrect me if I'm wrong -- that as to the likelihood of\nshowing up at the hearing itself, which this statute\nprotects, 80 percent of the people do show up.\nMR. OLSON: Well, 80 percent --\nQUESTION: Is that correct?\nMR. OLSON: Well, the -- the statistics have to\nbe looked at very carefully because that 20 percent --\n20 percent of the --\nQUESTION: Eight out of 10 of these criminals\nshow up.\nMR. OLSON: Well, no.\nQUESTION: That's very comforting.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: In that -- that -- well, actually\nthe -- it's -- it's worse than that, Justice Scalia,\nbecause that figure of 20 percent who absconded were\npeople that had been, during this period of time, been\ngiven individualized hearings. They were the ones that,\nafter a hearing, the authorities thought were probably\nlikely not to flee and 20 percent of that group did. When\nyou look at --\nQUESTION: But -- but they include all aliens\nand not just the -- the permanent resident aliens.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Souter, but there's no\nquestion that there were large numbers of lawful permanent\nresident aliens that were evading the deportation\nproceeding itself. Once the deportation --\nQUESTION: Well, I presume there was some,\nbut --\nQUESTION:\nwould answer this question. It's very important to\nunderstand the -- the Government's position on it. We're\nfocusing on the percentage who show up for the hearing.\nAm I -- and that's correct. That's what this statute is\ndirected at. And am I not correct that 80 percent of the\naliens in the class did show up for the hearing without\nbeing detained?\nMR. OLSON: No. The figure jumped to 40 percent\nfor people who were never detained at all, Justice\nStevens, and that's explained in the brief. The\n20 percent to which you're referring are people to which\nan individualized hearing was -- was given. In 1992\nalone, we're talking about 11,000 aliens, criminal aliens,\nwho had absconded. And we're not talking just about\nshowing up for the hearing because if that alien isn't in\ncustody, he won't -- and -- and the figure jumps to\n90 percent of people that will escape the deportation\norder itself if there --\nQUESTION: But the statute doesn't -- the\nstatute is not directed at the consequences after the\ndeportation order has been entered. Am I not right on\nthat?\nMR. OLSON: I -- I respectfully disagree in this\nsense, that if you have the alien in custody during the --\nthe removal period itself, he will be in custody at the\ntime the order is issued.\nQUESTION: Oh, I'm sure.\nMR. OLSON: If he's not, it's very difficult for\nthe Government --\nQUESTION: But if he's at the hearing, at the\nconclusion of the hearing, you say, lock this guy up.\nMR. OLSON: Well, that -- that is not the way\nthe process works, Justice Stevens. There is a potential\nappeal that the individual can take --\nQUESTION: No, but this statute is not directed\nat the time during potential appeal. It's directed at\nthe -- as I understand it -- now, you correct me if I'm\nwrong.\nMR. OLSON: No.\nQUESTION: As I understand the statute, it's\ndirected at the time before the hearing starts.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, it is, and the Government --\nand the Congress --\nQUESTION: So why can't the immigration judge at\nthe end of the hearing say, A, you're going to be removed,\nand B, you -- you go in the clink until your -- you go\naway?\nMR. OLSON: Well, but this -- let me answer it\nthis way. That 20 to 40 percent -- and the statistics are\ndifficult in this area.\nindividuals. We're talking about 15,000 criminals\nconvicted of serious crimes per year that are -- go\nthrough this process. If -- if we're losing 20 -- even\n20 percent of those individuals that are absconding from\nthe process and not available for deportation or removal,\nthat is the -- that is what Congress regarded as a very\nserious problem.\nQUESTION: I grant that --\nQUESTION: But, General Olson, you don't\nnecessarily lose them. All you're being asked to do is to\nhave an individualized hearing as to each member of that\n20 percent.\nMR. OLSON: But that 20 percent, Justice\nStevens -- and it's explained in the brief. That\n20 percent were the individuals for which there had been\nan individualized hearing given during that period of time\nwhen that process was taking place. If you don't have an\nindividualized hearing, of course, the numbers go up\nhigher.\nQUESTION: But why can't you deal with that\nproblem with a standard that's tough, that's different\nfrom having the hearing? After all, we give bail pending\nappeal to criminals who have been convicted. We give bail\nto alien terrorists who are about to be deported. Why\ncouldn't you have a tough standard but, nonetheless --\nlike bail pending appeal, but, nonetheless, give the bail\nhearing to the person who's willing to come in and he'd\nhave to show, you know, he's not going to run away, he's\nnot a danger, and he has a good issue on the merits?\nMR. OLSON: One of the -- one of the problems\nthat Congress had is that it had experimented with that\nprocess. It was not being successful. The individuals\nwere absconding notwithstanding --\nQUESTION: I don't think there was a tough\nstandard.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it -- it appeared -- it\nappeared to Congress and it appeared to the immigration\nauthorities to be a reasonably tough standard.\nThe problem with criminal aliens is that once --\nonce they enter this process, once they've been convicted\nafter due process of having committed a serious crime and\nonce they're in that process, which is virtually certain\nto lead to removal -- I mean, this is -- removal is\nautomatic --\nQUESTION: What I -- what I'm worried -- I see\nthat, and what I'm worried about on the other side of\nit -- I'm -- I can see also how you could limit it like to\nbail pending appeal, a tough standard. The other side of\nit is the alien who's there and who's the wrong person or\nthe -- or the statute doesn't apply to him or there's a\ncrime that they say he committed which he didn't. I mean,\nthere could --\nQUESTION: Isn't he able to challenge those\npoints?\nMR. OLSON: Pardon me?\nQUESTION: I thought those points can be\nchallenged. I thought he can get a hearing as to those\npoints.\nMR. OLSON: That's -- that's correct, Justice --\nQUESTION: We're only talking about people as to\nwhom it's acknowledged that they committed the crime, it's\nacknowledged that they're deportable. And the only reason\nthey may not get deported is the Attorney General might\nexercise discretion to let them into the country.\nMR. OLSON: That's -- that's precisely correct.\nQUESTION: That is correct. So if, in fact, I\nhave a good claim, I'm let out on bail while they're\nconsidering it?\nMR. OLSON: If -- no. If you have a -- if you\nas --\nQUESTION: You can take it to court.\nMR. OLSON: -- and I think it's on page -- pages\n26 and 27 of the Government's brief sets forth the -- the\nregulations of the -- of the Immigration and\nNaturalization Service that provide that you may have an\nimmediate hearing if it is not you, if you are a citizen,\nif you contend that you didn't -- weren't convicted of a\ncrime --\nQUESTION: If you have a claim, you're let out\non bail while they consider the claim?\nMR. OLSON: It's my understanding that what\nhappens is that there's an immediate, or a relatively\nprompt individualized hearing. I'm not positive of the\nanswer to that question, but there is the hearing that the\nNinth Circuit talked about --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: -- an individualized hearing,\nwhich -- which would have applied all the way across the\nboard --\nQUESTION: Well, given --\nMR. OLSON: -- in those cases under those\nregulations.\nQUESTION: Given that, General Olson, that we're\nonly talking about people who have acknowledged -- you\nknow, who have no claim that they didn't commit the crime,\nwho have no claim that they are not deportable, why do we\nhave to rely upon whether 80 percent of them will flee or\n90 percent, or even -- you know, or none of them will\nflee? Why is it -- does the Government concede that it's\nunreasonable to say, look, somebody who has no right to be\nat large in this country -- he's here illegally, has no\nright to be at large. And besides that, on top of that,\nhe's already committed a crime in this country. He should\nleave the country, and we're going to hold him in custody\nuntil he leaves. If he wants to fight that -- that\ndeparture, that's fine, but he will be in custody until he\ndeparts. What is -- what is wrong with that?\nMR. OLSON: Well, we're -- I'm not quarrelling\nwith your characterization of what --\nQUESTION: No, but you're -- you're fighting it\non the -- on the ground that somehow we have to prove --\nMR. OLSON: No. No, Justice --\nQUESTION: -- that a large number of them will\nflee.\nMR. OLSON: No. I'm simply --\nQUESTION: It seems to me that even if none of\nthem would flee, if they have no right to be here, if\nthey've committed a crime, why cannot -- they cannot be\nheld in -- in custody until they leave?\nMR. OLSON: This -- we may well be here on\nanother occasion defending a broader policy. But let me\nemphasize the facts that distinguish what you're\nsuggesting and what the Court considered in the Zadvydas\ncase, an immense difference that exists between the\ncircumstances here, and the circumstances under those\ncircumstances.\nQUESTION: Before you get to -- to Zadvydas and\nthe distinction, you -- you make, I take it, no\ndistinction between lawful permanent residents and people\nwho are excludable. People who are lawful permanent\nresidents have many rights in common with citizens.\nIndeed, this Court once said that they were a suspect\nclassification. But as far as this case is concerned, it\nseems to me you're making no distinction at all.\nMR. OLSON: The statute makes no distinction.\nThe Ninth Circuit, of course, did with respect to\nexcludable aliens, said that with that category of aliens,\nthe statute -- even under the Ninth Circuit's reasoning,\nthe statute was constitutional.\nWhat we -- the statute doesn't make that\ndistinction, but what it does do is it provides for a\nbrief, limited detention, which is not unlimited and not\npotentially permanent, of aliens, an area of Congress'\nauthorities at its zenith, convicted beyond a reasonable\ndoubt with --\nQUESTION: But it might be of a crime that\nthey -- one of the claims here is that this is not a\nqualifying plot -- crime. I don't get into that box. Now\nthat may be wrong or right, but suppose -- on your\nreading, or under this statute, someone would not be able\nto get bail despite a good claim that they are counting a\ncrime that doesn't qualify as one of these serious\noffenses.\nMR. OLSON: That's the question that I believe I\naddressed earlier that's referred to, the regulations --\nand I hope I'm correct -- at pages 26 and 27 of the\nGovernment's brief. The -- the regulations provide for\nsomeone claiming who is claiming that they are a citizen\nas opposed to an alien, or claiming that the crime for\nwhich they've been convicted was not a covered crime,\nmay -- may have an accelerated hearing, which is -- which\nis --\nQUESTION: In other words, for the class that\nwe're talking about, it's rather artificial to talk about\nlawful resident aliens because they can get a hearing on\nwhether their continuing residence is lawful. They --\nthey are determined to be deportable. They are no longer\nlawful resident aliens.\nMR. OLSON: That -- that is correct.\nQUESTION: Well, General Olson, aren't they\nlawful resident aliens until an order is entered that they\nbe deported?\nMR. OLSON: What they are is what -- they are --\nthey are lawful resident aliens until there's an order of\ndeportation, but --\nQUESTION: All right. So at the -- at the point\nof the -- we'll call it the preliminary hearing, the\nJoseph hearing, when they can bring these challenges,\nthere is no order that they be deported, and they,\ntherefore, have got to be considered, as I understand it,\nas lawful resident aliens.\nMR. OLSON: They -- however, they have -- they\nhave been convicted after due process of a crime that\nCongress considers serious, and they're being held for a\nlimited period of time --\nQUESTION: And they can get a hearing on whether\nthey are lawful resident aliens.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Can they? In effect, they can get a\nhearing on whether they are lawful resident aliens.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, if -- if I may\nreserve the remainder --\nQUESTION: Very well, General Olson.\nMs. Rabinovitz, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDY RABINOVITZ\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question in this case is whether Congress\nauthorized and, if so, whether the Due Process Clause\npermits a statute that requires that lawful permanent\nresidents like our client be imprisoned throughout the\nduration of removal proceedings.\nQUESTION: Ms. Rabinovitz, do you have a\nresponse to the jurisdiction problem? I mean, it's\npossible that despite the Government's failure to raise\nit, that we could do so.\nAnd why doesn't section 1226 tell the courts to\nkeep hands off?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Yes, Your Honor. We agree with\nthe Solicitor General's explanation for why this Court did\nnot --\nQUESTION: I have to tell you I don't understand\nit. I thought maybe you'd enlighten me there.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. RABINOVITZ: This -- this statute contains\nno express language that repeals habeas jurisdiction.\nThat's one answer that I could give you, Your Honor, and\nbased on this Court's decision in St. Cyr and Calcano,\nabsent that -- that language, the habeas -- there's still\njurisdiction in --\nQUESTION: How could that language not repeal\nhabeas jurisdiction?\nthe Attorney General under this section. How can -- how\ncan that -- I mean, what can you do in habeas corpus\nunless you're setting aside action by the Attorney General\nunder this section? How can that possibly not set aside\nhabeas corpus?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: But this Court has said --\nQUESTION: I mean, now, maybe you want to argue\nit's unconstitutional, but gee, to say that it doesn't do\nthis is -- I mean, it's -- it's incredible.\nQUESTION: Well, the Court in St. Cyr, with\nwhich both Justice Scalia and I disagreed, said something\nvery much like that, didn't it, that you had to be very\nspecific if you were going to repeal habeas jurisdiction?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Yes.\nQUESTION: Try Johnson v. Robson too.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: The point is that this statute\nrequires the Government to detain individuals like our\nclient who are lawful permanent residents not because\ntheir detention is necessary to protect the public from\ndanger of flight risk, but merely because they were\nconvicted in the past for one of a broad range of crimes\nthat the Government believes may render them deportable.\nQUESTION: Can -- you say the Government\nbelieves it. The Congress believed it, did it not?\nMS. RABINOVITZ:\nthat remains to be determined in all these cases is\nwhether an individual is, in fact, deportable. Congress\ndid decide that certain kinds of crimes should render an\nindividual deportable and these individuals have been\nconvicted of crimes. But the fact --\nQUESTION: What more do we need?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: The fact that they've been\nconvicted of a crime, Mr. Chief Justice, doesn't mean that\nit's a crime that renders them deportable under the\nstatute. And I think that this addresses, in part,\nJustice Kennedy's question about have they been -- is this\njust that they're suspected of committing crimes or have\nthey been convicted of crimes.\nQUESTION: Well, but in -- in this case, your --\nyour client was convicted, was he not?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice --\nQUESTION: So --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: He was convicted, but there\nstill is a question about whether his conviction actually\nrenders him deportable.\nQUESTION: And what question is that? Does\nCongress in the statute set forth the crimes?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: No, Your Honor. Congress sets\nforth a -- a broad category of crimes that can render\nsomebody deportable, and one of those is -- is a broad\ncategory that are labeled aggravated felonies.\nThe question, though -- and this is a question\nthat has been very hotly litigated in the courts -- is\nwhether a conviction is an aggravated felony. And in this\ncase, that question is especially relevant because in our\nclient's case, the conviction that he was --\nQUESTION: Well, did -- did you -- but the Ninth\nCircuit didn't go off on that basis, did it?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: No, Your Honor. The Ninth\nCircuit --\nQUESTION: So are you going to -- are you going\nto defend the Ninth Circuit's basis here?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: We're defending the Ninth\nCircuit's ruling, Your Honor.\nI'm -- I'm just explaining that this issue about\nwhether somebody is deportable is an open issue, and\nthat's precisely what the -- that's precisely what a\ndeportation proceeding is to determine.\nQUESTION: Now, Ms. Rabinovitz, I had -- I had\nunderstood from General Olson -- and please, you know, if\nit's wrong, I -- I want to know it -- that -- that your\nclient could get a hearing on that particular issue,\nwhether the crime he's being -- he has been convicted of\nis one of the crimes that entails deportation. Is -- is\nnot true that he can -- that he gets a hearing on that?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: He gets a hearing --\nQUESTION: Individualized hearing.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: He gets a hearing, Your Honor,\nbut it's a very limited hearing to the extent that that\nhearing does not determine that he has, in fact, been\nconvicted of a crime that renders him deportable. All\nthat it --\nQUESTION: In other words, it's a hearing that\nsays you were convicted of X or you weren't convicted\nof X. It's not a hearing that says that X renders you\ndeportable. Is that the point?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Yes, although, Your Honor, it\ndoes say that the Government is not substantially unlikely\nto prevail on its charge, so -- that you are deportable.\nSo -- and essentially it --\nQUESTION: So it --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: -- it says that there is\nreason -- there's a possibility. It's not impossible that\nyou will be found deportable. You -- that it's not --\nsince the Government is not substantially unlikely to\nprevail on the charge.\nI think it's important to recognize that there\nare many individuals who are subjected to mandatory\ndetention under this statute who cannot satisfy that\nstandard.\nand the court has held the Government substantially -- you\nknow, we can't show that the Government is substantially\nunlikely to prevail.\nQUESTION: I mean, I have a reason. I mean, now\nI am -- I'm confused on this and I'd appreciate it. I --\nI assume there is someone in prison. He's detained like\nyour client. There's a class of people. There are two\nsubgroups. Group 1 is a group that has no non-frivolous\nargument that they shouldn't be deported. It's virtually\nconceded they're -- they should be deported. Their only\narguments against it are frivolous. Group 2 are people\nwho have a real non-frivolous argument -- a real non-\nfrivolous argument -- that they aren't -- it's the wrong\nperson, this crime doesn't fall within the statutory\ndefinition, I probably will get asylum, something like\nthat. They have a real non-frivolous argument.\nNow, I thought that what we were talking about,\nat least in part, was that people in this group 2 were\nbeing held without bail. Now, am I right? Because I\nthink what I heard the Solicitor General say is I'm wrong.\nWe're only talking about people in group 1.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: No --\nQUESTION: That was just, I think, what Justice\nScalia was concerned about. That's just what I'm\nconcerned about, and I'd appreciate some elaboration on\nit.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: No, Your Honor. You're\nabsolutely right. We are talking about the second\ncategory of cases.\nQUESTION: But aren't there one-and-a-half or --\nthere's this Joseph hearing. It's not just that either\nyou have a hearing or you don't have a hearing. You have\nthe hearing that Justice Souter was referring to where\nyour burden is enormous because you will not succeed at\nthat hearing if you show it's more likely than not that\nthis crime is -- doesn't qualify as serious. You have to\nshow overwhelmingly that the Government will win on that\nissue in it. So -- but there is something other than --\nThere's this Joseph hearing, which you say is not\nadequate, is it?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Yes, Your Honor.\nIt's exactly --\nQUESTION: You're -- you're not asking just for\nindividualized hearings on those items, are you?\nYou're -- you're not just asking for individualized\nhearings on whether you are the person that did the --\nthat -- that was convicted and whether the -- the crime of\nconviction causes you to be deportable. You want a\nhearing on whether, if you are let go, you will show up\nfor -- for a later hearing.\nAnd I don't see why -- why that is necessary --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Yes --\nQUESTION: -- so long -- so long as you get a\nhearing on those other substantive points, it seems to me\nthe Government ought to be able to hold you, an alien who\nhas no right to be at large in this country, until you\nleave.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Let me try -- let me try to\nexplain how the statute works and why we believe that it's\na problem. The -- the proceeding that you're asking for,\na determination about whether, in fact, an individual is\ndeportable, is precisely what a deportation hearing is\nfor, and that kind of decision is not made the first time\nyou come before an immigration judge. It's often a very\nprotracted process, and we have individuals who have --\nwho have been in jail for 17 months pending an immigration\njudge hearing to determine that exact question, Justice\nScalia, about whether they are, in fact, deportable, which\nis why we say that the relevant question is whether\npending those proceedings, there's a regulatory purpose in\ndetaining that individual. And we're not --\nQUESTION: Well, and the -- the Government\nanswers that there's a substantial number of people who\ndon't show up for these hearings, and that's the purpose\nof holding them.\npurpose.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that is\na regulatory purpose. But this Court looks to the\nregulatory purpose in an individual's case when you're\ntalking about depriving somebody of a significant liberty\ninterest, which is what's here. We don't allow people to\nbe locked up based on averages.\nQUESTION: Well, but you -- look -- look at the\nimmigration cases. Look at Carlson against Landon.\nI mean, that certainly was a class, not an individual.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: No, Your Honor, Mr. Chief\nJustice. I respectfully -- I read Carlson differently.\nIn Carlson, what this Court did is it upheld the Attorney\nGeneral's discretionary decision that five individuals\ncould be detained because there was -- that -- the\ndecision to detain them was with not -- was not without\nreasonable foundation. It was a discretionary decision.\nIt's wholly different from this case.\nWhat makes this statute so unique and so\nunprecedented is that the Government is prohibited.\nThere's no discretion here. The Attorney General is\nprohibited from releasing individuals like our client, a\nlawful permanent resident who has a legal right to be\nhere, even when --\nQUESTION:\nhere, although he's been convicted of a crime which makes\nhim deportable.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: No, Mr. Chief Justice. It's\nnot clear that this conviction makes him deportable. In\nfact --\nQUESTION: Well, it's clear he's been convicted.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: He's been convicted of a crime,\nbut it's not clear that this conviction renders him\ndeportable. That's precisely what a deportation\nproceeding is for.\nQUESTION: You mean the first degree burglary\nconviction --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Both --\nQUESTION: -- is not an aggravated felony?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Not necessarily, Your Honor.\nThat remains to be determined, but --\nQUESTION: Well, how could a first degree\nburglary not be an aggravated felony?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: That's a good question,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Well, it's a very good question.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. RABINOVITZ: But -- but -- yes. But let me\npoint out -- I refer you to the -- the amicus brief for --\nby Citizens and -- and Immigrants for Equal Justice. It's\none of these green briefs. And it's on page 12 of their\nbrief. They referred to a case, the Solorzano-Patlan\ncase, where an individual was convicted of entering an\nautomobile with intent to commit theft, and the Board of\nImmigration of Appeals said -- or the -- the -- excuse me.\nThe immigration judge said exactly what -- what you have\nsaid, which is that how could this crime not be an\naggravated felony? It's a burglary, entering an\nautomobile with intent to commit theft.\nOne-and-a-half years after our client -- after\nthis person -- excuse me -- he wasn't our client -- was\ndetained, the Seventh Circuit disagreed. Despite what the\nBoard of Immigration Appeals said that how could this\ncrime not be a burglary --\nQUESTION: Well, but -- it's not just a question\nof being a burglary. First degree burglary usually means\nwith -- with people present and on the premises.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Mr. Chief Justice --\nQUESTION: Of course, the Seventh -- Seventh\nCircuit might have been wrong.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. RABINOVITZ: That's a good point, Your\nHonor, but the Government did not petition for cert in\nthat case.\nAnd -- and the point that I want to make --\nQUESTION: Well, it sounds like you're -- you're\nstill seeking some kind of facial invalidation of the\nstatute rather than as applied to your client.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: No, Your Honor, we're not\nseeking --\nQUESTION: Because you're relying on a\nconviction of someone else for a different kind of a\ncrime.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: No.\nQUESTION: Are we talking about this person as\nan as-applied challenge, or do we have a facial challenge?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Your Honor, this is definitely\nan as-applied challenge, and I refer you to page --\nQUESTION: So we are talking about the first\ndegree burglary --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Yes, we are.\nQUESTION: -- not entering a car with intent to\ncommit theft.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Right, right.\nMy point with raising that example was just to\npoint out that the question of what constitutes an\naggravated felony is very contested.\nQUESTION: And isn't it the --\nQUESTION: Well, but not in this case.\nQUESTION: Not in this case. First degree\nburglary.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Oh, it -- it certainly is. It\nremains a question about whether this is an aggravated\nfelony --\nQUESTION: Well, but --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: -- because you need to look at\nthe precise --\nQUESTION: Justice Breyer's classification of\npeople who have really serious claims and people who have\nfrivolous claims -- surely a claim that first degree\nburglary is not deportable under the statute would verge\non the frivolous.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Mr. Chief Justice, I need to --\nto disagree with you. It's unclear. To decide whether\nthis is -- is an aggravated felony, the Court is going to\nneed to look at the specific language of the statute.\nThe -- the specific crime that our client committed was he\nbroke and entered into a tool shed and he was convicted\nunder California State law. This is a very complicated,\ntechnical area of the law.\nAnd all that I can tell you is that if you refer\nto our brief at page 5, note 6 -- oh, no. Excuse me.\nThat's not the place. To our brief at -- our brief at\npage 30, note 27, we note numerous examples where the\nquestion of whether something is an aggravated felony has\nbeen contested and decided --\nQUESTION: Do you -- you consider whether he\nbroke into an inhabited tool shed, I guess, to be not\nwithin the statute, and the other side thinks it is.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Right. Right. Right.\nQUESTION: In your opinion, would -- would --\nand this goes back to my initial question which I'm\nstill -- haven't heard you really answer. Look, on\nappeal, somebody who has been convicted of a crime, in\norder to get out on -- on appeal -- have bail on appeal,\nhe has to show not only he wouldn't run away, not only he\nisn't a danger, but also that he raises a substantial\nquestion.\nNow, suppose that we were to say at least those\npeople who show that they raise a substantial question --\na substantial question -- and it says not for purposes of\ndelay -- that as to those people, you have to have an\nindividualized hearing.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: In this case, if we're talking\nabout somebody who raises a non-frivolous challenge like\nour client, that would satisfy this case because this\nis --\nQUESTION: Well, I'm not saying if it'd satisfy\nthe case, though I take it from what you say it would\nsatisfy you and your position.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Your Honor, I misspoke. What I\nmeant is that in this case, this is an as-applied\nchallenge. It's a -- it's a challenge about whether this\nstatute as applied to our client who's a lawful permanent\nresident, who has bona fide challenges that he is not\ndeportable and is eligible for relief from deportation,\nthat in this case, applying the statute to him is\nunconstitutional.\nQUESTION: So to keep someone in prison without\nbail, after they've been convicted of something, pending a\ndeportation order is not constitutional without an\nindividualized hearing at least if -- or don't say at\nleast -- if, among other things, he shows there is a\nsubstantial question not for purposes of delay. Imagine\nan opinion that said that. Would you argue for or against\nthat opinion?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: I would argue for that opinion\nin this case because it would resolve this case. I\nbelieve that there also might be -- there would be a\nconstitutional issue that even somebody else -- due\nprocess requires that they have an opportunity to show\nthat they're not a danger and a flight risk because that\nis the purpose of regulatory detention. And as the --\nQUESTION: I -- I note that you have redefined\nsubstantial question as non-frivolous. Anything that's\nnot sanctionable raises a substantial question for\npurposes of -- of this new rule?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Yes, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Wow.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: -- and -- and it has to be that\nway because there are so many examples of circuit courts\nfinding that the board's decision about what constitutes a\ndeportable offense is wrong and yet, that those were cases\nwhere the individual could -- where their -- their claim\nmight have been considered bordering on the frivolous,\neven though it wasn't.\nAnd let give you a very --\nQUESTION: That -- that is true but all --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Let me give you an example.\nQUESTION: -- all of -- at least for people who\nhave committed their crimes after this statute was\nenacted, it seems to me that they are on notice. If you\nget convicted of a felony, your -- your welcome in this\ncountry is at an end if it's an aggravated felony, and you\nwill be held until it is -- it is finally determined\nwhether that is, indeed, an aggravated felony or not.\nI don't know that that's terribly unfair.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: But your question presupposes\nthe answer. You're saying --\nQUESTION: No, it doesn't.\nof the risks you take when you commit a felony. Your --\nit's -- it's part of -- of the condition of your\nadmittance to this country. Once this statute is passed,\nany lawful resident alien knows that if he commits a\nfelony and it's an aggravated felony, he will be deported.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Two points.\nQUESTION: And -- and until the question of\nwhether it is an aggravated felony, assuming it's at least\narguable, is decided, he will be held in custody and not\npermitted to be at large in this country.\nNow, that doesn't strike me as terribly\nunreasonable. Just don't do the felony.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Well, two points, Your Honor.\nFirst, in this case, the conviction that is now being\nconsidered as possibly an aggravated felony was committed\nbefore the statute took effect. So even under Your\nHonor's proposal, the statute could not apply to him.\nIn terms of what you're suggesting, though, if\nCongress was to say that anybody who -- there still is an\nissue of whether somebody is, in fact, deportable, and to\ncondition -- and -- and this Court has recognized that\nindividuals who are facing deportation, particularly\nlawful permanent residents, have a right to a fair\nhearing. To say that those individuals must give up their\nright to physical liberty --\nQUESTION: Well, but there's no question that\nthese people are going to get a fair hearing eventually.\nThe question you're challenging is whether they should\nbe -- be incarcerated pending that hearing. So we're not\ntalking about a fair hearing.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: You're right, Your Honor,\nMr. Chief Justice. But the -- the point is that if\nsomebody is locked up for a year-and-a-half, and they\ncan't get the evidence for their case, because being\nlocked up in jails also makes it much harder for people to\npresent their cases, there's no right to appointed\ncounsel. It means they can't work.\nThere are -- and this is, again, where I would\nlike to refer you, just in general, to the amicus brief by\nthe Citizens and Immigrants for Equal Justice which points\nout other cases where individuals gave up their claims\nbecause otherwise they were going to be in detention for\nso long.\nAnd let me just point out one other --\nQUESTION: Well, you -- you've got someone who\nis an alien here. The alien has committed a felony.\nI mean, it's difficult to -- for me to say that they\nshould have all these additional benefits so that somehow\nthey can avoid deportation.\nMS. RABINOVITZ:\nMr. Chief Justice, this -- it's not only for people who\nare convicted of felonies. Even the definition --\nQUESTION: Well, but that's with the case we're\ndealing of here.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Okay, but the -- the question\nis what -- what constitutes an aggravated felony.\nMisdemeanors constitute an aggravated felony as well.\nYou're right. In this case, the initial conviction --\nQUESTION: What -- what do you -- what do you\nmean, misdemeanors constitute an aggravated felony?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: I know it's somewhat shocking,\nMr. Chief Justice, but, in fact, the way that aggravated\nfelony has been defined so broadly --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: -- the courts have held that\neven misdemeanors can be aggravated felonies.\nQUESTION: But there's no question that first\ndegree burglary is not a misdemeanor. So, in our case,\nthat's not -- we don't have to worry about that, do we?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: But let me return to the point\nabout whether it's -- whether due process is satisfied by\nrequiring that somebody be mandatorily detained throughout\nthe process of their deportation proceeding, a process\nwhich, as I said, can be months, often years, without any\nindividualized determination of danger and flight risk.\nAnd the example that I wanted to give ties back\nwith this Court's decision in St. Cyr, which said that\n212(c) relief was available to individuals whose\nconvictions -- who had pled guilty prior to -- to the\nstatute having taken effect. All of those individuals\nwere subject to mandatory detention under the statute.\nTheir claim would have been considered close to frivolous\nuntil the Supreme Court ruled differently.\nQUESTION: Well, that's -- that's -- I mean,\nyour argument to me rings true for people who have real\nclaims, but if you're trying to apply it to a person who\nhas an insubstantial claim or a claim that is interposed\nfor purposes of delay, I'm tempted to say, well, there's a\nvery good reason to keep him locked up, namely, he doesn't\nhave any argument and he's about to be deported and -- and\nif he wants to be deported quickly, he can be.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Your Honor, that's --\nQUESTION: But if he has a substantial claim,\nit's different.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Your Honor, I think it's\nimportant to recognize that that's precisely the kind of\nfactors that the Immigration Service and the immigration\njudge looks at when they make a determination whether\nsomebody should be released on bond. They -- when they're\ndetermining flight risk, that's precisely what they look\nat. They say, oh, this is a frivolous -- this is a\nfrivolous claim. We're not going to release this person\non bond because they're not going to show up. And we're\nnot saying that individuals in that situation should be\nreleased from detention.\nAll that we're saying is that an individual\nneeds to be given some opportunity to demonstrate, look,\nI was convicted of this crime, but I have claims for\nrelief. I'm not a flight risk. I'm not a danger.\nQUESTION: Would you say that --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: And I think it's important to\nlook at --\nQUESTION: Would you agree that the alien has\nthe burden of showing that?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Your Honor, we have no --\nQUESTION: In your -- in your regime, you\nwould -- would there be any problem putting the burden on\nthe alien to show that?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: We have no problem with\nCongress creating a presumption that individuals who are\ncharged with these kinds of -- with being deportable for\nthese kinds of crimes are a danger and are a flight risk,\nand that they need to come forward to show that they're\nnot. And in fact --\nQUESTION:\nminute. But insofar as the substantiality or -- or the\nlikelihood of prevailing -- forget about flight risk for a\nmoment. Insofar as the likelihood of prevailing and the\nsubstantiality of the -- of the issue, that's almost what\nthe statute already provides for in a bail determination\nhearing, as set forth on page 26 of the Government's\nbrief. A person in INS custody is -- is entitled to a\nbond determination hearing. And the standard is whether\nor not the Government is -- he has to show the Government\nis substantially unlikely to prevail. That's very --\nforget flight risk for a moment. That is very close to\nthe regime that you propose. So I don't see what we're\narguing about here as to that.\nNow, if you want to say that you're entitled to\nrelease if you're not a flight risk, that's something\nquite different. And I would -- and I would doubt the\nlatter, but --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Let me try to clarify what I\nbelieve is some confusion about what that hearing does.\nThe hearing essentially just shows you need to show that\nthe Government has no frivolous claim. That's essentially\nwhat you need to show. I mean, you have to show that the\nGovernment had -- that the Government's charge is\nfrivolous. And I would assume that the Government is not\nputting people into proceedings if they have no possible\nargument. But to require that an individual be locked up\nthroughout the whole deportation process just because they\ncannot show that the Government has a -- has a frivolous\nclaim, that doesn't satisfy due process.\nIn terms of burden, Your Honor, what I was\nreferring to -- what I thought you were referring to is\nwhether an individual is going to have an obligation to\nshow that they're not a danger of flight risk. But\neven --\nQUESTION: Well, perhaps that's why I asked you\nthat question first. It -- it does seem to me that if you\nconcede that he has the burden, that that is really very,\nvery close to what the -- the statute already provides,\nforgetting about flight risk for the moment, or -- or --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Yes, Your Honor. I don't --\nI don't see it that way. I see that the question about if\nyou need -- if an individual has to prove that the\nGovernment's argument is frivolous, that's not the same\nthing as showing that you have a non-frivolous claim. And\nthat's all that we're saying. I think that they're\ncompletely different. One is showing that the\nGovernment's argument is frivolous.\nI don't -- most of the cases where individuals\nwere found not deportable, it wasn't that the Government's\nclaim was frivolous, but those individuals prevailed in\ntheir proceedings. And that's the issue here, whether --\nwhether an individual can be detained for a substantial\nperiod of time without any opportunity to show that --\nthat there's no purpose that's served by their detention.\nAnd I think that -- that this case is a perfect\nexample because in this case, once the district court --\nour client was detained for 6 months without any\nindividualized determination. The district court then\nsaid due process requires an individualized determination,\nand the INS, the Immigration Service, on its own decided\nhe poses no danger and he can be released on 5,000-dollar\nbond. And he's been out for the past 3-and-a-half years.\nHe's now getting his college degree. He's working.\nIf the Government prevails in this appeal, it\nwill have no choice but to re-incarcerate him throughout\nhis proceedings. It's not a question of discretion like\nCarlson, where they can make that determination.\nAnd going back to your question about burden, I\nthink it's important to recognize that the regime that was\nin place prior to this statute, and that is now in place\nin those circuits where they've said that the statute\nneeds to be interpreted to -- or that the statute -- due\nprocess requires an individualized determination, still\nrequires that an individual show that they are not a\ndanger of flight risk. They bear that burden. And so\nunder this system, no individual who's a danger of flight\nrisk is going to be released except for those cases where\nthere's, you know, obviously going to be error. But in\ngeneral, individuals who are a danger of flight risk\naren't going to be released.\nI think it -- there's one last point that I\nwould like to make because I realize my time is short,\nwhich is that this case poses a serious constitutional\nproblem, and we believe that there is a way that this\nCourt can avoid that problem by construing the statute to\nnot apply to individuals like our client who are, in fact,\nnot deportable.\nThe statute says that individuals shall be\nmandatorily detained. An individual who is deportable on\none of these grounds is subject to mandatory detention.\nAs we've been talking about here, in fact, the question of\nwhether he is deportable remains very much to be decided.\nHe doesn't have any order of deportation.\nQUESTION: Ms. Rabinovitz, why wasn't Judge\nFletcher absolutely right in rejecting that claim?\nBecause the language is when the alien is released from\ncriminal custody.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Because --\nQUESTION: The statute directs custody when the\nalien is released from criminal custody, and not at some\nlater time, not at the time of the issuance of a removal\norder.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Because I think that what Judge\nFletcher was not aware of is that the whole regime right\nnow that the Immigration Service has is to conduct\ndeportation proceedings while individuals are still\nserving their criminal sentence, which makes complete\nsense, because then you do not have this problem. People\nare already ordered deported, determined deportable while\nthey are still in jail. And so the --\nQUESTION: But still, if the statute says when\nreleased from criminal custody, even before release, but\nit doesn't say at the later time of the final removal\norder.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: There's two different issues,\nJustice Ginsburg. One is when -- is deportable. It says,\nwhen released. Our point is only that there are\nindividuals who have deportation proceedings while they're\nin prison, and there will be an immigration judge decision\nor a BIA decision that says they are deportable.\nNow, they may still be seeking review of that\ndecision in the Federal courts, in which case, that\ndecision is not final and they would not fit under the\nnext statute, the statute that you -- that this Court\nconstrued in -- in Zadvydas, which was 1241, but they\nwould -- or excuse me -- 1231. But they would still have\nan order of deportation, and then, that would be a way to\nsay that individual is deportable.\nWhereas, here you have a situation where anybody\nwho the Government charges with being deportable -- in\nthis case, our client, even though he may not actually be\ndeportable -- is subject to mandatory detention for\npossibly a year, 2 years, however long.\nI see my time is up.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Rabinovitz.\nMr. Olson, General Olson, you have 4 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nQUESTION: General Olson, I don't want to\nintrude upon your rebuttal time, but I have one question\nthat's very important for me and you can answer it yes or\nno. Assuming I disagree with you as to the reading of the\nstatute as to whether there is jurisdiction in this case,\nif there is no jurisdiction, is that provision of the\nstatute in the view of the Government unconstitutional?\nMR. OLSON: No. Now, we haven't briefed and\nstudied that and -- and I have to rely on the answer that\nI gave before. But I think that that would be a correct\nwith -- it would be within the power of Congress to do\nthat under certain circumstances.\nQUESTION: Well, you can rely on the presumption\nof constitutionality if you haven't briefed it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: Well, then I would've have to answer\nthe question differently.\nWell, if -- I guess no, I guess I would --\nthat -- that's a good answer.\nLet me -- let me --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: Let me just deal with a few things\nthat were raised during my colleague's argument.\nFirst of all, the date of the offense that's\ninvolved in this case was after the enactment of this\nstatute. On page 8 of the respondent's brief, it is\nasserted that he was convicted of petty theft with priors\nand sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment in 1997. That was\nwhen that conviction took place.\nSecondly -- and I think a lot of time has been\nexpended with respect to the question that focused in\nlarge part by Justice Breyer. What happens if it's not\nthe individual? What happens if he's really a citizen?\nWhat happens if he wants to challenge whether this crime\nwas one that should be covered?\nAs we said on page 26 -- and we cite the\nrelevant provision of the INS regulations -- those types\nof things can be challenged in an individualized bond\nhearing at which the -- which is what the Ninth Circuit\nwas talking about and which is what our opponents are\ntalking about here, and that those issues may be raised at\nthat point, which is precisely what the respondents are\ntalking about. So that's already built into the statute.\nNow, one might quarrel with whether -- what the\nburden of proof is, and where it should be and how it\nshould be written, but that's a -- this is a determination\nby the executive branch with respect to the statute. If\nthe alien can show that the INS is substantially unlikely\nto prevail on its underlying charge of removability, then\nthe individual may be released on bond. If the decision\ngoes against the individual, that can be taken to the\nBoard of Immigration Appeals. So there's a process that\ntakes care of precisely those -- that category 2, as you\nput it.\nNow, that does not deal with the question of\ndangerousness or risk of flight, but that's what Congress\nwas concerned about when it -- when it enacted the\nstatute. Congress was concerned about a situation in\nwhich large numbers of individuals who commit serious\ncrimes -- and Congress went to the effort of define what\nit thought -- defining what it thought was serious crimes.\nNow, if there is some question about that in an\nindividual case, or if there's some question about an\naberrational lengthy detention, that should be brought to\nthis Court or the courts below in an as-applied challenge.\nThe respondent is saying here today that this is an\nas-applied challenge, but that has never been the way this\ncase has been litigated from the petition, which I cited\nas a facial challenge, through the district court's\ndecision to the -- to the as -- the -- the facial\nchallenge in part of the decision of the Ninth Circuit.\nThis has been a challenge to the congressional\ndetermination that people who commit serious crimes are\nto -- to be deportable as rapidly as possible.\nThey -- and -- and to the -- in order for that\npolicy to be effectuated, for our borders to be protected,\nto avoid the acculturation of a criminal alien class in\nthe United States that's operating freely, for a limited\nperiod of time, that individual will be detained during\nthat process until the final order of deportation is\nentered.\n85 percent of the aliens that are brought into\nthese procedures don't even challenge the immigration\ndecision -- immigration judge decision, and more than half\nof those cases are resolved within 30 days. The\nstatistics are in the brief.\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Olson.\nMR. OLSON: Thank you.\n(Whereupon, at 11:14 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"

        "content": "(10:13 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in Number 01-1491, Charles DeMore versus Hyung Joon\nKim.\nGeneral Olson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nBased upon years of experience, study, hearings,\nand overwhelming persuasive evidence, Congress concluded\nthat the prompt removal of aliens convicted of committing\nserious felonies was essential to the Nation's ability to\ncontrol its borders.\nremoval proceedings was considered vital by Congress to\neffectuate that policy, to prevent flight, to evade\nremoval, and to prevent harm done by recidivist criminal\naliens.\nThis is a facial substantive due process\nchallenge which cannot succeed unless there are no sets\nof -- no set of circumstances under which the\ncongressional policy would be constitutional.\nAs this Court has repeatedly --\nQUESTION: General Olson, do -- do we have\nauthority to entertain this challenge? As you know, an\namicus has raised a jurisdictional question, and I think\ndid it maybe in the court of appeals stage as well. It\ncertainly did it early on here.\nThe problem is section 1126(e) which says, no\ncourt may set aside any action or decision by the Attorney\nGeneral under this section regarding the detention or\nrelease of any alien or the grant, revocation, or denial\nof bond or parole. Now, is that provision, number one,\ninapplicable or, number two, unconstitutional? And if\nneither of those, why doesn't it mean that we have no\nauthority to entertain this case?\nMR. OLSON: Justice Scalia, it's the\nGovernment's position, as held by three courts of appeals,\nthat that provision does not apply to a habeas corpus\nchallenge to the constitutionality of the statute itself,\nthat the language of that provision relates to challenges\nto an action by the Attorney General or administrative\naction and does not preclude a challenge.\nQUESTION: No. It doesn't -- doesn't say the\nchallenge -- no. It says, no court may set aside any\naction by the Attorney General. And -- and what is asked\nfor here is that we set aside the Attorney General's\naction in detailing -- in detaining this alien.\nMR. OLSON: It's -- it's our submission, after\ncareful examination -- the Government originally took that\nposition that you've suggested in court proceedings. It\nwas rejected by three courts of appeals. We studied it\nfurther. The Government studied it further and came to\nthe conclusion that those decisions were correct and it\nwould not preclude -- and we're not contending here\ntoday --\nQUESTION: And -- and you're relying on what\nlanguage to --\nMR. OLSON: Well, we're relying on the language\nthat it refers to, and a reasonable construction of the\nstatute refers to actions, administrative actions, by the\nAttorney General or immigration -- administrative action\nby administrative officials, and this Court's construction\nof statutes against precluding constitutional challenges\nto other statutes.\nQUESTION: Oh, but all of those other statutes\nhad some wiggle room I think, even St. Cyr, and there just\nis no wiggle room here. It doesn't refer to judicial\nreview. It simply says, no court may set aside any action\nby the Attorney General under this section.\nQUESTION: Even in the Quirin case where the --\nthe presidential order said that the people shall have no\naccess to the courts at all, this Court sat to hear\nwhether that sort of a provision was constitutional or\nnot.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand while it would be in the Government's interest to\npreclude this challenge at all, we think a fair reading of\nthe Court's decisions, including the -- the Court -- the\ndecision that the Chief Justice mentioned, would to --\nwould be to construe that statute as not to preclude this\naction in this case. Of course, that would lead -- your\nconstruction would lead to a -- a victory on behalf of the\nGovernment in this case, but we've carefully examined it,\nand we think that we're not advocating that position here\ntoday.\nQUESTION: Well, I appreciate your carefully\nexamining it, but I'd still like to know what language in\nit leads your careful examination to conclude that it does\nnot cover this case. I mean, if it's unconstitutional,\nthat's another matter.\nMR. OLSON: Well, we -- we may be --\nQUESTION: Maybe we'll strike it down for that\nreason. But my goodness --\nMR. OLSON: We -- we may be wrong, Justice\nScalia, but we're referring to and relying on the second\nsentence which says, no court may set aside any action or\ndecision by the Attorney General under this section. It\ndoes not state -- and -- and we think the Court would\nconstrue it as not precluding a challenge to the\nconstitutionality of the -- of the policy made by the\nCongress itself in enacting --\nQUESTION: It doesn't refer to the issue. It\ndoesn't refer to the basis on which the setting aside is\ndone. It doesn't say, may set aside, you know, on grounds\nother than -- it doesn't even refer to the basis. It\nsays, no court may set aside any action by the --\nMR. OLSON: I understand, Justice Scalia, and\nthe Government did, indeed, make that assertion, take that\nposition in early proceedings in this case. It was\nrejected by three courts of appeals. We came to a\ndifferent conclusion after reexamining it, and that's our\nposition here today.\nAs this Court has repeatedly stated, Congress\nhas exceedingly broad latitude in dealing with aliens,\nimmigration, and the Nation's borders.\nQUESTION: Can I have a quick answer just to --\nyou said a facial challenge. I've been assuming that it's\na challenge brought by a resident alien who himself has a\nplausible claim that the statute doesn't apply to him\nbecause he's saying two -- you know, petty theft with a --\npetty theft with a prior is not -- doesn't fall within the\ncategory of crimes. I don't know if that's right or\nwrong, but shouldn't I consider the case of a person who\nhas a -- an arguable claim that he's outside the system?\nMR. OLSON: Well, Justice Breyer, the -- the\ncase has not been litigated on that basis from its very\nbeginning. I refer the Court to page 9 of the joint\nappendix which is -- which, at the bottom of that section,\narticulates the requested relief by the -- by the\nrespondent in this case. Petitioner seeks a declaration\nthat this provision is unconstitutional on its face as\nviolative --\nQUESTION: It uses those words, I know. I just\ndon't know how to consider it that way. I mean, a person\nwho had no claim whatsoever -- am I supposed to consider\nit on the basis of a person who has -- well, he would get\nthe removal order entered in 24 hours if he had no claim\nwhatsoever.\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nQUESTION: Is that who I'm supposed to consider?\nMR. OLSON: Well, it --\nQUESTION: -- or somebody like the plaintiff\nhere?\nMR. OLSON: If this -- not only is it in the\npetition for habeas corpus that the individual was\nchallenging on its face, the district court considered it\non that basis, and the Ninth Circuit considered it on that\nbasis, and it's been litigated here all the way through by\nthe -- by the respondent on that basis. If there was to\nbe an as-applied challenge, there would be a great deal of\nother considerations.\nAnd -- and this -- as this Court has said, the\nfacial challenge must be rejected unless there are no set\nof circumstances under which the congressional policy\nwould be upheld.\nQUESTION: General Olson, didn't --\nMR. OLSON: There -- there's been no --\nQUESTION: -- didn't the Ninth Circuit narrow\nthe group somewhat? I thought that in the district court,\nthe district court said the whole thing falls. I thought\nthe Ninth Circuit said only as to lawfully admitted --\nwhat was it? Lawful permanent residents. And so that was\nnot taking the whole thing at its face, but only a part of\nthe total group.\nQUESTION: I had the same question. It's at 6a\nof the petition for the appendix. The court of appeals,\nin the paragraph at the bottom of 6a, says we stop short\nof affirming the holding that it's facially\nunconstitutional.\nQUESTION: Right.\nQUESTION: We affirm the grant of habeas corpus\non the ground the statute is unconstitutional as applied\nto him in his status as a lawful permanent resident of the\nUnited States.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, and the Ninth Circuit -- the\nNinth Circuit did say that both on page 6 -- 6a and -- and\non page 30a. But what -- what the Ninth Circuit did was\nissue a broad, sweeping declaration of unconstitutionality\nof the statute with respect to a broad class of\nindividuals, that is to say, all lawful permanent\nresidents. That's the equivalent of a facial decision as\nto unconstitutionality as to a broad spectrum of the\npeople covered. And -- and --\nQUESTION: So it's your position, in effect,\nthat although the Ninth Circuit said it was an applied\nchallenge, in fact the Ninth Circuit itself struck it\nfacially.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, Justice --\nQUESTION: It just narrowed the description of\nwhat it did. Is that right?\nMR. OLSON: That's -- that is correct, Justice\nO'Connor. That's --\nQUESTION: But it -- but it struck it facially\nonly with respect to the permanent resident aliens.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct.\nQUESTION: To permanent resident aliens.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Sort of half-facial.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: Mostly facial.\nQUESTION: Mostly facial.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: That's -- that is what the Ninth\nCircuit did, and it's our position that this -- this case\nmust be considered under those circumstances as a facial\nchallenge.\nAs I was saying, the Court has repeatedly said\nthat in connection with immigration and protecting the\nNation's borders, there is no power at which there is more\ndeference to congressional judgment, no authority under\nthe Constitution granted more to the political branches,\nparticularly to Congress. Congress regularly makes rules,\nthis Court has said, applicable to aliens that would be\nunacceptable if applied to citizens.\nQUESTION: Is there a regulation or -- or is\nthere a policy with -- in the Department of Justice or the\nINS which says that there has to be a conviction before\nyou utilize this section? Or if the Attorney General just\nhas information that a felony has been committed, is that\nsufficient to detain?\nMR. OLSON: Well, the statute --\nQUESTION: Here there was a conviction.\nMR. OLSON: Here there was a conviction, and\nthat is specifically what is said in the statute itself.\nIt's my understanding --\nQUESTION: Well, the statute itself talks about\na conviction.\nMR. OLSON: Absolutely. And -- and what happens\nin practice, Justice Kennedy, is that either the removal\nproceeding is brought, as Congress has suggested, if\npossible, during the period of incarceration of the\nindividual, or immediately upon release from\nincarceration.\nSo we were talking, to summarize, a -- this --\nthis provision under 1226(c) applies only to the period of\nthe removal proceeding itself, which was carefully\ndistinguished by this Court in its Zadvydas decision of\n2 years ago.\ndecision, not an unlimited, potentially permanent\ndetention period, what, as the Court suggested in -- in a\ndistinguishable situation a number of years -- years ago\nin the Carlson case involving members of the Communist\nParty, a temporary, limited detention for the purpose of\nkeeping the individual in custody, an individual who's had\na full panoply of due process, having been convicted\nbeyond a reasonable doubt with full due process of --\nQUESTION: Yes, but General, it is true, is it\nnot, that there are people in the class who might have\nbeen convicted even before the statute was passed. So\nyou're not just -- just continuing detention. You have to\ngo out and find them and -- and put them under detention.\nMR. OLSON: It's my understanding, Justice\nStevens, that it applies to convictions after the statute\nwas passed. I may be misunderstanding that, and if so,\nI'll try to correct that during -- during rebuttal. But\nthat to the vast -- that would all -- to the extent that\nthat might be true and I might be mistaken, that would\nonly illustrate why this is a facial challenge. The\nstatute itself should not be declared unconstitutional,\nparticularly in connection with individuals convicted\nafterwards.\nQUESTION: What -- what about this particular\nindividual?\nMR. OLSON: This was after the statute was\npassed, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: General Olson, you've -- you've put\nin statistics about the number of -- of aliens who don't\nshow up for the hearings and the -- the rather low\npercentage of those who are ultimately deported from the\nclass that don't show up and so on.\nOn your view of the Government's authority\nover -- over aliens and the deference that the Court owes,\nwould our -- in your judgment should our decision be the\nsame regardless of those statistics? If you had told us\nnothing about the -- the probabilities of catching people,\nshould we, on your view, or would we, on your view, be\nobligated to defer and simply say it's up to the\nGovernment?\nMR. OLSON: Well, I think Justice Souter, the\nanswer to that is that the test that the Court has\nconsistently applied in this area is there -- is there a\nrational basis, is the congressional objective rationally\nlikely to advance a legitimate governmental purpose.\nThose statistics that we set forth in our brief and which\nwere before Congress when Congress enacted this statute,\nprovide the purpose for which Congress acted.\nQUESTION: Well -- well, is that rational basis\nreview the one we would employ in reviewing legislation\npassed by Congress concerning immigration policy? And\nhave we applied a more circumscribed review over the means\nof effectuating those policies? Are -- are there separate\nquestions? I mean, the power of Congress to pass the law\nand to say what it does versus the implementation of it.\nMR. OLSON: Well, under certain circumstances,\nthe Court has used that language.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. OLSON: The -- the means to achieve the\nobjective --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: -- will be looked at possibly\nseparately.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: But it seems to me -- and it seems\nobvious particularly in this case -- that the means are\nwrapped up in the objective itself.\nWhat -- it is clear Congress is dealing with a\nvery difficult problem of a certain category or groups of\naliens that were committing serious crimes in this\ncountry.\nQUESTION: Well, does -- is -- does that -- do\nyour statistics define that category as the -- the legal\npermanent resident aliens or all aliens? I think it's the\nlatter.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it is -- yes, Justice Souter,\nit's all.\nQUESTION: But if it -- if it is the latter,\nthen I don't know that the statistics tell us anything one\nway or the other about the legitimacy of the ends, i.e.,\nthe -- the automatic detention, with -- with respect to\nthe class that we've got under consideration here.\nMR. OLSON: What the statistics tell us is that\nthere were large numbers of aliens committing serious\ncrimes and that those -- those individuals committing\nthose crimes were highly likely to be recidivists and that\nthey were -- that class of individuals or those groups of\nindividuals were cultivating a criminal class that was\nengaging in organized --\nQUESTION: But, General Olson, those statistics\ngo to the likelihood of entry of the order of deportation,\nnot of the likelihood of flight which this statute is\ndirected at.\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nQUESTION: As I understand the statistics --\ncorrect me if I'm wrong -- that as to the likelihood of\nshowing up at the hearing itself, which this statute\nprotects, 80 percent of the people do show up.\nMR. OLSON: Well, 80 percent --\nQUESTION: Is that correct?\nMR. OLSON: Well, the -- the statistics have to\nbe looked at very carefully because that 20 percent --\n20 percent of the --\nQUESTION: Eight out of 10 of these criminals\nshow up.\nMR. OLSON: Well, no.\nQUESTION: That's very comforting.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: In that -- that -- well, actually\nthe -- it's -- it's worse than that, Justice Scalia,\nbecause that figure of 20 percent who absconded were\npeople that had been, during this period of time, been\ngiven individualized hearings. They were the ones that,\nafter a hearing, the authorities thought were probably\nlikely not to flee and 20 percent of that group did. When\nyou look at --\nQUESTION: But -- but they include all aliens\nand not just the -- the permanent resident aliens.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Souter, but there's no\nquestion that there were large numbers of lawful permanent\nresident aliens that were evading the deportation\nproceeding itself. Once the deportation --\nQUESTION: Well, I presume there was some,\nbut --\nQUESTION:\nwould answer this question. It's very important to\nunderstand the -- the Government's position on it. We're\nfocusing on the percentage who show up for the hearing.\nAm I -- and that's correct. That's what this statute is\ndirected at. And am I not correct that 80 percent of the\naliens in the class did show up for the hearing without\nbeing detained?\nMR. OLSON: No. The figure jumped to 40 percent\nfor people who were never detained at all, Justice\nStevens, and that's explained in the brief. The\n20 percent to which you're referring are people to which\nan individualized hearing was -- was given. In 1992\nalone, we're talking about 11,000 aliens, criminal aliens,\nwho had absconded. And we're not talking just about\nshowing up for the hearing because if that alien isn't in\ncustody, he won't -- and -- and the figure jumps to\n90 percent of people that will escape the deportation\norder itself if there --\nQUESTION: But the statute doesn't -- the\nstatute is not directed at the consequences after the\ndeportation order has been entered. Am I not right on\nthat?\nMR. OLSON: I -- I respectfully disagree in this\nsense, that if you have the alien in custody during the --\nthe removal period itself, he will be in custody at the\ntime the order is issued.\nQUESTION: Oh, I'm sure.\nMR. OLSON: If he's not, it's very difficult for\nthe Government --\nQUESTION: But if he's at the hearing, at the\nconclusion of the hearing, you say, lock this guy up.\nMR. OLSON: Well, that -- that is not the way\nthe process works, Justice Stevens. There is a potential\nappeal that the individual can take --\nQUESTION: No, but this statute is not directed\nat the time during potential appeal. It's directed at\nthe -- as I understand it -- now, you correct me if I'm\nwrong.\nMR. OLSON: No.\nQUESTION: As I understand the statute, it's\ndirected at the time before the hearing starts.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, it is, and the Government --\nand the Congress --\nQUESTION: So why can't the immigration judge at\nthe end of the hearing say, A, you're going to be removed,\nand B, you -- you go in the clink until your -- you go\naway?\nMR. OLSON: Well, but this -- let me answer it\nthis way. That 20 to 40 percent -- and the statistics are\ndifficult in this area.\nindividuals. We're talking about 15,000 criminals\nconvicted of serious crimes per year that are -- go\nthrough this process. If -- if we're losing 20 -- even\n20 percent of those individuals that are absconding from\nthe process and not available for deportation or removal,\nthat is the -- that is what Congress regarded as a very\nserious problem.\nQUESTION: I grant that --\nQUESTION: But, General Olson, you don't\nnecessarily lose them. All you're being asked to do is to\nhave an individualized hearing as to each member of that\n20 percent.\nMR. OLSON: But that 20 percent, Justice\nStevens -- and it's explained in the brief. That\n20 percent were the individuals for which there had been\nan individualized hearing given during that period of time\nwhen that process was taking place. If you don't have an\nindividualized hearing, of course, the numbers go up\nhigher.\nQUESTION: But why can't you deal with that\nproblem with a standard that's tough, that's different\nfrom having the hearing? After all, we give bail pending\nappeal to criminals who have been convicted. We give bail\nto alien terrorists who are about to be deported. Why\ncouldn't you have a tough standard but, nonetheless --\nlike bail pending appeal, but, nonetheless, give the bail\nhearing to the person who's willing to come in and he'd\nhave to show, you know, he's not going to run away, he's\nnot a danger, and he has a good issue on the merits?\nMR. OLSON: One of the -- one of the problems\nthat Congress had is that it had experimented with that\nprocess. It was not being successful. The individuals\nwere absconding notwithstanding --\nQUESTION: I don't think there was a tough\nstandard.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it -- it appeared -- it\nappeared to Congress and it appeared to the immigration\nauthorities to be a reasonably tough standard.\nThe problem with criminal aliens is that once --\nonce they enter this process, once they've been convicted\nafter due process of having committed a serious crime and\nonce they're in that process, which is virtually certain\nto lead to removal -- I mean, this is -- removal is\nautomatic --\nQUESTION: What I -- what I'm worried -- I see\nthat, and what I'm worried about on the other side of\nit -- I'm -- I can see also how you could limit it like to\nbail pending appeal, a tough standard. The other side of\nit is the alien who's there and who's the wrong person or\nthe -- or the statute doesn't apply to him or there's a\ncrime that they say he committed which he didn't. I mean,\nthere could --\nQUESTION: Isn't he able to challenge those\npoints?\nMR. OLSON: Pardon me?\nQUESTION: I thought those points can be\nchallenged. I thought he can get a hearing as to those\npoints.\nMR. OLSON: That's -- that's correct, Justice --\nQUESTION: We're only talking about people as to\nwhom it's acknowledged that they committed the crime, it's\nacknowledged that they're deportable. And the only reason\nthey may not get deported is the Attorney General might\nexercise discretion to let them into the country.\nMR. OLSON: That's -- that's precisely correct.\nQUESTION: That is correct. So if, in fact, I\nhave a good claim, I'm let out on bail while they're\nconsidering it?\nMR. OLSON: If -- no. If you have a -- if you\nas --\nQUESTION: You can take it to court.\nMR. OLSON: -- and I think it's on page -- pages\n26 and 27 of the Government's brief sets forth the -- the\nregulations of the -- of the Immigration and\nNaturalization Service that provide that you may have an\nimmediate hearing if it is not you, if you are a citizen,\nif you contend that you didn't -- weren't convicted of a\ncrime --\nQUESTION: If you have a claim, you're let out\non bail while they consider the claim?\nMR. OLSON: It's my understanding that what\nhappens is that there's an immediate, or a relatively\nprompt individualized hearing. I'm not positive of the\nanswer to that question, but there is the hearing that the\nNinth Circuit talked about --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: -- an individualized hearing,\nwhich -- which would have applied all the way across the\nboard --\nQUESTION: Well, given --\nMR. OLSON: -- in those cases under those\nregulations.\nQUESTION: Given that, General Olson, that we're\nonly talking about people who have acknowledged -- you\nknow, who have no claim that they didn't commit the crime,\nwho have no claim that they are not deportable, why do we\nhave to rely upon whether 80 percent of them will flee or\n90 percent, or even -- you know, or none of them will\nflee? Why is it -- does the Government concede that it's\nunreasonable to say, look, somebody who has no right to be\nat large in this country -- he's here illegally, has no\nright to be at large. And besides that, on top of that,\nhe's already committed a crime in this country. He should\nleave the country, and we're going to hold him in custody\nuntil he leaves. If he wants to fight that -- that\ndeparture, that's fine, but he will be in custody until he\ndeparts. What is -- what is wrong with that?\nMR. OLSON: Well, we're -- I'm not quarrelling\nwith your characterization of what --\nQUESTION: No, but you're -- you're fighting it\non the -- on the ground that somehow we have to prove --\nMR. OLSON: No. No, Justice --\nQUESTION: -- that a large number of them will\nflee.\nMR. OLSON: No. I'm simply --\nQUESTION: It seems to me that even if none of\nthem would flee, if they have no right to be here, if\nthey've committed a crime, why cannot -- they cannot be\nheld in -- in custody until they leave?\nMR. OLSON: This -- we may well be here on\nanother occasion defending a broader policy. But let me\nemphasize the facts that distinguish what you're\nsuggesting and what the Court considered in the Zadvydas\ncase, an immense difference that exists between the\ncircumstances here, and the circumstances under those\ncircumstances.\nQUESTION: Before you get to -- to Zadvydas and\nthe distinction, you -- you make, I take it, no\ndistinction between lawful permanent residents and people\nwho are excludable. People who are lawful permanent\nresidents have many rights in common with citizens.\nIndeed, this Court once said that they were a suspect\nclassification. But as far as this case is concerned, it\nseems to me you're making no distinction at all.\nMR. OLSON: The statute makes no distinction.\nThe Ninth Circuit, of course, did with respect to\nexcludable aliens, said that with that category of aliens,\nthe statute -- even under the Ninth Circuit's reasoning,\nthe statute was constitutional.\nWhat we -- the statute doesn't make that\ndistinction, but what it does do is it provides for a\nbrief, limited detention, which is not unlimited and not\npotentially permanent, of aliens, an area of Congress'\nauthorities at its zenith, convicted beyond a reasonable\ndoubt with --\nQUESTION: But it might be of a crime that\nthey -- one of the claims here is that this is not a\nqualifying plot -- crime. I don't get into that box. Now\nthat may be wrong or right, but suppose -- on your\nreading, or under this statute, someone would not be able\nto get bail despite a good claim that they are counting a\ncrime that doesn't qualify as one of these serious\noffenses.\nMR. OLSON: That's the question that I believe I\naddressed earlier that's referred to, the regulations --\nand I hope I'm correct -- at pages 26 and 27 of the\nGovernment's brief. The -- the regulations provide for\nsomeone claiming who is claiming that they are a citizen\nas opposed to an alien, or claiming that the crime for\nwhich they've been convicted was not a covered crime,\nmay -- may have an accelerated hearing, which is -- which\nis --\nQUESTION: In other words, for the class that\nwe're talking about, it's rather artificial to talk about\nlawful resident aliens because they can get a hearing on\nwhether their continuing residence is lawful. They --\nthey are determined to be deportable. They are no longer\nlawful resident aliens.\nMR. OLSON: That -- that is correct.\nQUESTION: Well, General Olson, aren't they\nlawful resident aliens until an order is entered that they\nbe deported?\nMR. OLSON: What they are is what -- they are --\nthey are lawful resident aliens until there's an order of\ndeportation, but --\nQUESTION: All right. So at the -- at the point\nof the -- we'll call it the preliminary hearing, the\nJoseph hearing, when they can bring these challenges,\nthere is no order that they be deported, and they,\ntherefore, have got to be considered, as I understand it,\nas lawful resident aliens.\nMR. OLSON: They -- however, they have -- they\nhave been convicted after due process of a crime that\nCongress considers serious, and they're being held for a\nlimited period of time --\nQUESTION: And they can get a hearing on whether\nthey are lawful resident aliens.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Can they? In effect, they can get a\nhearing on whether they are lawful resident aliens.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, if -- if I may\nreserve the remainder --\nQUESTION: Very well, General Olson.\nMs. Rabinovitz, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDY RABINOVITZ\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question in this case is whether Congress\nauthorized and, if so, whether the Due Process Clause\npermits a statute that requires that lawful permanent\nresidents like our client be imprisoned throughout the\nduration of removal proceedings.\nQUESTION: Ms. Rabinovitz, do you have a\nresponse to the jurisdiction problem? I mean, it's\npossible that despite the Government's failure to raise\nit, that we could do so.\nAnd why doesn't section 1226 tell the courts to\nkeep hands off?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Yes, Your Honor. We agree with\nthe Solicitor General's explanation for why this Court did\nnot --\nQUESTION: I have to tell you I don't understand\nit. I thought maybe you'd enlighten me there.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. RABINOVITZ: This -- this statute contains\nno express language that repeals habeas jurisdiction.\nThat's one answer that I could give you, Your Honor, and\nbased on this Court's decision in St. Cyr and Calcano,\nabsent that -- that language, the habeas -- there's still\njurisdiction in --\nQUESTION: How could that language not repeal\nhabeas jurisdiction?\nthe Attorney General under this section. How can -- how\ncan that -- I mean, what can you do in habeas corpus\nunless you're setting aside action by the Attorney General\nunder this section? How can that possibly not set aside\nhabeas corpus?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: But this Court has said --\nQUESTION: I mean, now, maybe you want to argue\nit's unconstitutional, but gee, to say that it doesn't do\nthis is -- I mean, it's -- it's incredible.\nQUESTION: Well, the Court in St. Cyr, with\nwhich both Justice Scalia and I disagreed, said something\nvery much like that, didn't it, that you had to be very\nspecific if you were going to repeal habeas jurisdiction?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Yes.\nQUESTION: Try Johnson v. Robson too.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: The point is that this statute\nrequires the Government to detain individuals like our\nclient who are lawful permanent residents not because\ntheir detention is necessary to protect the public from\ndanger of flight risk, but merely because they were\nconvicted in the past for one of a broad range of crimes\nthat the Government believes may render them deportable.\nQUESTION: Can -- you say the Government\nbelieves it. The Congress believed it, did it not?\nMS. RABINOVITZ:\nthat remains to be determined in all these cases is\nwhether an individual is, in fact, deportable. Congress\ndid decide that certain kinds of crimes should render an\nindividual deportable and these individuals have been\nconvicted of crimes. But the fact --\nQUESTION: What more do we need?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: The fact that they've been\nconvicted of a crime, Mr. Chief Justice, doesn't mean that\nit's a crime that renders them deportable under the\nstatute. And I think that this addresses, in part,\nJustice Kennedy's question about have they been -- is this\njust that they're suspected of committing crimes or have\nthey been convicted of crimes.\nQUESTION: Well, but in -- in this case, your --\nyour client was convicted, was he not?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice --\nQUESTION: So --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: He was convicted, but there\nstill is a question about whether his conviction actually\nrenders him deportable.\nQUESTION: And what question is that? Does\nCongress in the statute set forth the crimes?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: No, Your Honor. Congress sets\nforth a -- a broad category of crimes that can render\nsomebody deportable, and one of those is -- is a broad\ncategory that are labeled aggravated felonies.\nThe question, though -- and this is a question\nthat has been very hotly litigated in the courts -- is\nwhether a conviction is an aggravated felony. And in this\ncase, that question is especially relevant because in our\nclient's case, the conviction that he was --\nQUESTION: Well, did -- did you -- but the Ninth\nCircuit didn't go off on that basis, did it?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: No, Your Honor. The Ninth\nCircuit --\nQUESTION: So are you going to -- are you going\nto defend the Ninth Circuit's basis here?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: We're defending the Ninth\nCircuit's ruling, Your Honor.\nI'm -- I'm just explaining that this issue about\nwhether somebody is deportable is an open issue, and\nthat's precisely what the -- that's precisely what a\ndeportation proceeding is to determine.\nQUESTION: Now, Ms. Rabinovitz, I had -- I had\nunderstood from General Olson -- and please, you know, if\nit's wrong, I -- I want to know it -- that -- that your\nclient could get a hearing on that particular issue,\nwhether the crime he's being -- he has been convicted of\nis one of the crimes that entails deportation. Is -- is\nnot true that he can -- that he gets a hearing on that?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: He gets a hearing --\nQUESTION: Individualized hearing.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: He gets a hearing, Your Honor,\nbut it's a very limited hearing to the extent that that\nhearing does not determine that he has, in fact, been\nconvicted of a crime that renders him deportable. All\nthat it --\nQUESTION: In other words, it's a hearing that\nsays you were convicted of X or you weren't convicted\nof X. It's not a hearing that says that X renders you\ndeportable. Is that the point?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Yes, although, Your Honor, it\ndoes say that the Government is not substantially unlikely\nto prevail on its charge, so -- that you are deportable.\nSo -- and essentially it --\nQUESTION: So it --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: -- it says that there is\nreason -- there's a possibility. It's not impossible that\nyou will be found deportable. You -- that it's not --\nsince the Government is not substantially unlikely to\nprevail on the charge.\nI think it's important to recognize that there\nare many individuals who are subjected to mandatory\ndetention under this statute who cannot satisfy that\nstandard.\nand the court has held the Government substantially -- you\nknow, we can't show that the Government is substantially\nunlikely to prevail.\nQUESTION: I mean, I have a reason. I mean, now\nI am -- I'm confused on this and I'd appreciate it. I --\nI assume there is someone in prison. He's detained like\nyour client. There's a class of people. There are two\nsubgroups. Group 1 is a group that has no non-frivolous\nargument that they shouldn't be deported. It's virtually\nconceded they're -- they should be deported. Their only\narguments against it are frivolous. Group 2 are people\nwho have a real non-frivolous argument -- a real non-\nfrivolous argument -- that they aren't -- it's the wrong\nperson, this crime doesn't fall within the statutory\ndefinition, I probably will get asylum, something like\nthat. They have a real non-frivolous argument.\nNow, I thought that what we were talking about,\nat least in part, was that people in this group 2 were\nbeing held without bail. Now, am I right? Because I\nthink what I heard the Solicitor General say is I'm wrong.\nWe're only talking about people in group 1.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: No --\nQUESTION: That was just, I think, what Justice\nScalia was concerned about. That's just what I'm\nconcerned about, and I'd appreciate some elaboration on\nit.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: No, Your Honor. You're\nabsolutely right. We are talking about the second\ncategory of cases.\nQUESTION: But aren't there one-and-a-half or --\nthere's this Joseph hearing. It's not just that either\nyou have a hearing or you don't have a hearing. You have\nthe hearing that Justice Souter was referring to where\nyour burden is enormous because you will not succeed at\nthat hearing if you show it's more likely than not that\nthis crime is -- doesn't qualify as serious. You have to\nshow overwhelmingly that the Government will win on that\nissue in it. So -- but there is something other than --\nThere's this Joseph hearing, which you say is not\nadequate, is it?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Yes, Your Honor.\nIt's exactly --\nQUESTION: You're -- you're not asking just for\nindividualized hearings on those items, are you?\nYou're -- you're not just asking for individualized\nhearings on whether you are the person that did the --\nthat -- that was convicted and whether the -- the crime of\nconviction causes you to be deportable. You want a\nhearing on whether, if you are let go, you will show up\nfor -- for a later hearing.\nAnd I don't see why -- why that is necessary --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Yes --\nQUESTION: -- so long -- so long as you get a\nhearing on those other substantive points, it seems to me\nthe Government ought to be able to hold you, an alien who\nhas no right to be at large in this country, until you\nleave.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Let me try -- let me try to\nexplain how the statute works and why we believe that it's\na problem. The -- the proceeding that you're asking for,\na determination about whether, in fact, an individual is\ndeportable, is precisely what a deportation hearing is\nfor, and that kind of decision is not made the first time\nyou come before an immigration judge. It's often a very\nprotracted process, and we have individuals who have --\nwho have been in jail for 17 months pending an immigration\njudge hearing to determine that exact question, Justice\nScalia, about whether they are, in fact, deportable, which\nis why we say that the relevant question is whether\npending those proceedings, there's a regulatory purpose in\ndetaining that individual. And we're not --\nQUESTION: Well, and the -- the Government\nanswers that there's a substantial number of people who\ndon't show up for these hearings, and that's the purpose\nof holding them.\npurpose.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that is\na regulatory purpose. But this Court looks to the\nregulatory purpose in an individual's case when you're\ntalking about depriving somebody of a significant liberty\ninterest, which is what's here. We don't allow people to\nbe locked up based on averages.\nQUESTION: Well, but you -- look -- look at the\nimmigration cases. Look at Carlson against Landon.\nI mean, that certainly was a class, not an individual.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: No, Your Honor, Mr. Chief\nJustice. I respectfully -- I read Carlson differently.\nIn Carlson, what this Court did is it upheld the Attorney\nGeneral's discretionary decision that five individuals\ncould be detained because there was -- that -- the\ndecision to detain them was with not -- was not without\nreasonable foundation. It was a discretionary decision.\nIt's wholly different from this case.\nWhat makes this statute so unique and so\nunprecedented is that the Government is prohibited.\nThere's no discretion here. The Attorney General is\nprohibited from releasing individuals like our client, a\nlawful permanent resident who has a legal right to be\nhere, even when --\nQUESTION:\nhere, although he's been convicted of a crime which makes\nhim deportable.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: No, Mr. Chief Justice. It's\nnot clear that this conviction makes him deportable. In\nfact --\nQUESTION: Well, it's clear he's been convicted.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: He's been convicted of a crime,\nbut it's not clear that this conviction renders him\ndeportable. That's precisely what a deportation\nproceeding is for.\nQUESTION: You mean the first degree burglary\nconviction --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Both --\nQUESTION: -- is not an aggravated felony?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Not necessarily, Your Honor.\nThat remains to be determined, but --\nQUESTION: Well, how could a first degree\nburglary not be an aggravated felony?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: That's a good question,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Well, it's a very good question.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. RABINOVITZ: But -- but -- yes. But let me\npoint out -- I refer you to the -- the amicus brief for --\nby Citizens and -- and Immigrants for Equal Justice. It's\none of these green briefs. And it's on page 12 of their\nbrief. They referred to a case, the Solorzano-Patlan\ncase, where an individual was convicted of entering an\nautomobile with intent to commit theft, and the Board of\nImmigration of Appeals said -- or the -- the -- excuse me.\nThe immigration judge said exactly what -- what you have\nsaid, which is that how could this crime not be an\naggravated felony? It's a burglary, entering an\nautomobile with intent to commit theft.\nOne-and-a-half years after our client -- after\nthis person -- excuse me -- he wasn't our client -- was\ndetained, the Seventh Circuit disagreed. Despite what the\nBoard of Immigration Appeals said that how could this\ncrime not be a burglary --\nQUESTION: Well, but -- it's not just a question\nof being a burglary. First degree burglary usually means\nwith -- with people present and on the premises.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Mr. Chief Justice --\nQUESTION: Of course, the Seventh -- Seventh\nCircuit might have been wrong.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. RABINOVITZ: That's a good point, Your\nHonor, but the Government did not petition for cert in\nthat case.\nAnd -- and the point that I want to make --\nQUESTION: Well, it sounds like you're -- you're\nstill seeking some kind of facial invalidation of the\nstatute rather than as applied to your client.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: No, Your Honor, we're not\nseeking --\nQUESTION: Because you're relying on a\nconviction of someone else for a different kind of a\ncrime.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: No.\nQUESTION: Are we talking about this person as\nan as-applied challenge, or do we have a facial challenge?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Your Honor, this is definitely\nan as-applied challenge, and I refer you to page --\nQUESTION: So we are talking about the first\ndegree burglary --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Yes, we are.\nQUESTION: -- not entering a car with intent to\ncommit theft.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Right, right.\nMy point with raising that example was just to\npoint out that the question of what constitutes an\naggravated felony is very contested.\nQUESTION: And isn't it the --\nQUESTION: Well, but not in this case.\nQUESTION: Not in this case. First degree\nburglary.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Oh, it -- it certainly is. It\nremains a question about whether this is an aggravated\nfelony --\nQUESTION: Well, but --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: -- because you need to look at\nthe precise --\nQUESTION: Justice Breyer's classification of\npeople who have really serious claims and people who have\nfrivolous claims -- surely a claim that first degree\nburglary is not deportable under the statute would verge\non the frivolous.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Mr. Chief Justice, I need to --\nto disagree with you. It's unclear. To decide whether\nthis is -- is an aggravated felony, the Court is going to\nneed to look at the specific language of the statute.\nThe -- the specific crime that our client committed was he\nbroke and entered into a tool shed and he was convicted\nunder California State law. This is a very complicated,\ntechnical area of the law.\nAnd all that I can tell you is that if you refer\nto our brief at page 5, note 6 -- oh, no. Excuse me.\nThat's not the place. To our brief at -- our brief at\npage 30, note 27, we note numerous examples where the\nquestion of whether something is an aggravated felony has\nbeen contested and decided --\nQUESTION: Do you -- you consider whether he\nbroke into an inhabited tool shed, I guess, to be not\nwithin the statute, and the other side thinks it is.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Right. Right. Right.\nQUESTION: In your opinion, would -- would --\nand this goes back to my initial question which I'm\nstill -- haven't heard you really answer. Look, on\nappeal, somebody who has been convicted of a crime, in\norder to get out on -- on appeal -- have bail on appeal,\nhe has to show not only he wouldn't run away, not only he\nisn't a danger, but also that he raises a substantial\nquestion.\nNow, suppose that we were to say at least those\npeople who show that they raise a substantial question --\na substantial question -- and it says not for purposes of\ndelay -- that as to those people, you have to have an\nindividualized hearing.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: In this case, if we're talking\nabout somebody who raises a non-frivolous challenge like\nour client, that would satisfy this case because this\nis --\nQUESTION: Well, I'm not saying if it'd satisfy\nthe case, though I take it from what you say it would\nsatisfy you and your position.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Your Honor, I misspoke. What I\nmeant is that in this case, this is an as-applied\nchallenge. It's a -- it's a challenge about whether this\nstatute as applied to our client who's a lawful permanent\nresident, who has bona fide challenges that he is not\ndeportable and is eligible for relief from deportation,\nthat in this case, applying the statute to him is\nunconstitutional.\nQUESTION: So to keep someone in prison without\nbail, after they've been convicted of something, pending a\ndeportation order is not constitutional without an\nindividualized hearing at least if -- or don't say at\nleast -- if, among other things, he shows there is a\nsubstantial question not for purposes of delay. Imagine\nan opinion that said that. Would you argue for or against\nthat opinion?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: I would argue for that opinion\nin this case because it would resolve this case. I\nbelieve that there also might be -- there would be a\nconstitutional issue that even somebody else -- due\nprocess requires that they have an opportunity to show\nthat they're not a danger and a flight risk because that\nis the purpose of regulatory detention. And as the --\nQUESTION: I -- I note that you have redefined\nsubstantial question as non-frivolous. Anything that's\nnot sanctionable raises a substantial question for\npurposes of -- of this new rule?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Yes, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Wow.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: -- and -- and it has to be that\nway because there are so many examples of circuit courts\nfinding that the board's decision about what constitutes a\ndeportable offense is wrong and yet, that those were cases\nwhere the individual could -- where their -- their claim\nmight have been considered bordering on the frivolous,\neven though it wasn't.\nAnd let give you a very --\nQUESTION: That -- that is true but all --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Let me give you an example.\nQUESTION: -- all of -- at least for people who\nhave committed their crimes after this statute was\nenacted, it seems to me that they are on notice. If you\nget convicted of a felony, your -- your welcome in this\ncountry is at an end if it's an aggravated felony, and you\nwill be held until it is -- it is finally determined\nwhether that is, indeed, an aggravated felony or not.\nI don't know that that's terribly unfair.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: But your question presupposes\nthe answer. You're saying --\nQUESTION: No, it doesn't.\nof the risks you take when you commit a felony. Your --\nit's -- it's part of -- of the condition of your\nadmittance to this country. Once this statute is passed,\nany lawful resident alien knows that if he commits a\nfelony and it's an aggravated felony, he will be deported.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Two points.\nQUESTION: And -- and until the question of\nwhether it is an aggravated felony, assuming it's at least\narguable, is decided, he will be held in custody and not\npermitted to be at large in this country.\nNow, that doesn't strike me as terribly\nunreasonable. Just don't do the felony.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Well, two points, Your Honor.\nFirst, in this case, the conviction that is now being\nconsidered as possibly an aggravated felony was committed\nbefore the statute took effect. So even under Your\nHonor's proposal, the statute could not apply to him.\nIn terms of what you're suggesting, though, if\nCongress was to say that anybody who -- there still is an\nissue of whether somebody is, in fact, deportable, and to\ncondition -- and -- and this Court has recognized that\nindividuals who are facing deportation, particularly\nlawful permanent residents, have a right to a fair\nhearing. To say that those individuals must give up their\nright to physical liberty --\nQUESTION: Well, but there's no question that\nthese people are going to get a fair hearing eventually.\nThe question you're challenging is whether they should\nbe -- be incarcerated pending that hearing. So we're not\ntalking about a fair hearing.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: You're right, Your Honor,\nMr. Chief Justice. But the -- the point is that if\nsomebody is locked up for a year-and-a-half, and they\ncan't get the evidence for their case, because being\nlocked up in jails also makes it much harder for people to\npresent their cases, there's no right to appointed\ncounsel. It means they can't work.\nThere are -- and this is, again, where I would\nlike to refer you, just in general, to the amicus brief by\nthe Citizens and Immigrants for Equal Justice which points\nout other cases where individuals gave up their claims\nbecause otherwise they were going to be in detention for\nso long.\nAnd let me just point out one other --\nQUESTION: Well, you -- you've got someone who\nis an alien here. The alien has committed a felony.\nI mean, it's difficult to -- for me to say that they\nshould have all these additional benefits so that somehow\nthey can avoid deportation.\nMS. RABINOVITZ:\nMr. Chief Justice, this -- it's not only for people who\nare convicted of felonies. Even the definition --\nQUESTION: Well, but that's with the case we're\ndealing of here.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Okay, but the -- the question\nis what -- what constitutes an aggravated felony.\nMisdemeanors constitute an aggravated felony as well.\nYou're right. In this case, the initial conviction --\nQUESTION: What -- what do you -- what do you\nmean, misdemeanors constitute an aggravated felony?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: I know it's somewhat shocking,\nMr. Chief Justice, but, in fact, the way that aggravated\nfelony has been defined so broadly --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: -- the courts have held that\neven misdemeanors can be aggravated felonies.\nQUESTION: But there's no question that first\ndegree burglary is not a misdemeanor. So, in our case,\nthat's not -- we don't have to worry about that, do we?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: But let me return to the point\nabout whether it's -- whether due process is satisfied by\nrequiring that somebody be mandatorily detained throughout\nthe process of their deportation proceeding, a process\nwhich, as I said, can be months, often years, without any\nindividualized determination of danger and flight risk.\nAnd the example that I wanted to give ties back\nwith this Court's decision in St. Cyr, which said that\n212(c) relief was available to individuals whose\nconvictions -- who had pled guilty prior to -- to the\nstatute having taken effect. All of those individuals\nwere subject to mandatory detention under the statute.\nTheir claim would have been considered close to frivolous\nuntil the Supreme Court ruled differently.\nQUESTION: Well, that's -- that's -- I mean,\nyour argument to me rings true for people who have real\nclaims, but if you're trying to apply it to a person who\nhas an insubstantial claim or a claim that is interposed\nfor purposes of delay, I'm tempted to say, well, there's a\nvery good reason to keep him locked up, namely, he doesn't\nhave any argument and he's about to be deported and -- and\nif he wants to be deported quickly, he can be.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Your Honor, that's --\nQUESTION: But if he has a substantial claim,\nit's different.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Your Honor, I think it's\nimportant to recognize that that's precisely the kind of\nfactors that the Immigration Service and the immigration\njudge looks at when they make a determination whether\nsomebody should be released on bond. They -- when they're\ndetermining flight risk, that's precisely what they look\nat. They say, oh, this is a frivolous -- this is a\nfrivolous claim. We're not going to release this person\non bond because they're not going to show up. And we're\nnot saying that individuals in that situation should be\nreleased from detention.\nAll that we're saying is that an individual\nneeds to be given some opportunity to demonstrate, look,\nI was convicted of this crime, but I have claims for\nrelief. I'm not a flight risk. I'm not a danger.\nQUESTION: Would you say that --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: And I think it's important to\nlook at --\nQUESTION: Would you agree that the alien has\nthe burden of showing that?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Your Honor, we have no --\nQUESTION: In your -- in your regime, you\nwould -- would there be any problem putting the burden on\nthe alien to show that?\nMS. RABINOVITZ: We have no problem with\nCongress creating a presumption that individuals who are\ncharged with these kinds of -- with being deportable for\nthese kinds of crimes are a danger and are a flight risk,\nand that they need to come forward to show that they're\nnot. And in fact --\nQUESTION:\nminute. But insofar as the substantiality or -- or the\nlikelihood of prevailing -- forget about flight risk for a\nmoment. Insofar as the likelihood of prevailing and the\nsubstantiality of the -- of the issue, that's almost what\nthe statute already provides for in a bail determination\nhearing, as set forth on page 26 of the Government's\nbrief. A person in INS custody is -- is entitled to a\nbond determination hearing. And the standard is whether\nor not the Government is -- he has to show the Government\nis substantially unlikely to prevail. That's very --\nforget flight risk for a moment. That is very close to\nthe regime that you propose. So I don't see what we're\narguing about here as to that.\nNow, if you want to say that you're entitled to\nrelease if you're not a flight risk, that's something\nquite different. And I would -- and I would doubt the\nlatter, but --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Let me try to clarify what I\nbelieve is some confusion about what that hearing does.\nThe hearing essentially just shows you need to show that\nthe Government has no frivolous claim. That's essentially\nwhat you need to show. I mean, you have to show that the\nGovernment had -- that the Government's charge is\nfrivolous. And I would assume that the Government is not\nputting people into proceedings if they have no possible\nargument. But to require that an individual be locked up\nthroughout the whole deportation process just because they\ncannot show that the Government has a -- has a frivolous\nclaim, that doesn't satisfy due process.\nIn terms of burden, Your Honor, what I was\nreferring to -- what I thought you were referring to is\nwhether an individual is going to have an obligation to\nshow that they're not a danger of flight risk. But\neven --\nQUESTION: Well, perhaps that's why I asked you\nthat question first. It -- it does seem to me that if you\nconcede that he has the burden, that that is really very,\nvery close to what the -- the statute already provides,\nforgetting about flight risk for the moment, or -- or --\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Yes, Your Honor. I don't --\nI don't see it that way. I see that the question about if\nyou need -- if an individual has to prove that the\nGovernment's argument is frivolous, that's not the same\nthing as showing that you have a non-frivolous claim. And\nthat's all that we're saying. I think that they're\ncompletely different. One is showing that the\nGovernment's argument is frivolous.\nI don't -- most of the cases where individuals\nwere found not deportable, it wasn't that the Government's\nclaim was frivolous, but those individuals prevailed in\ntheir proceedings. And that's the issue here, whether --\nwhether an individual can be detained for a substantial\nperiod of time without any opportunity to show that --\nthat there's no purpose that's served by their detention.\nAnd I think that -- that this case is a perfect\nexample because in this case, once the district court --\nour client was detained for 6 months without any\nindividualized determination. The district court then\nsaid due process requires an individualized determination,\nand the INS, the Immigration Service, on its own decided\nhe poses no danger and he can be released on 5,000-dollar\nbond. And he's been out for the past 3-and-a-half years.\nHe's now getting his college degree. He's working.\nIf the Government prevails in this appeal, it\nwill have no choice but to re-incarcerate him throughout\nhis proceedings. It's not a question of discretion like\nCarlson, where they can make that determination.\nAnd going back to your question about burden, I\nthink it's important to recognize that the regime that was\nin place prior to this statute, and that is now in place\nin those circuits where they've said that the statute\nneeds to be interpreted to -- or that the statute -- due\nprocess requires an individualized determination, still\nrequires that an individual show that they are not a\ndanger of flight risk. They bear that burden. And so\nunder this system, no individual who's a danger of flight\nrisk is going to be released except for those cases where\nthere's, you know, obviously going to be error. But in\ngeneral, individuals who are a danger of flight risk\naren't going to be released.\nI think it -- there's one last point that I\nwould like to make because I realize my time is short,\nwhich is that this case poses a serious constitutional\nproblem, and we believe that there is a way that this\nCourt can avoid that problem by construing the statute to\nnot apply to individuals like our client who are, in fact,\nnot deportable.\nThe statute says that individuals shall be\nmandatorily detained. An individual who is deportable on\none of these grounds is subject to mandatory detention.\nAs we've been talking about here, in fact, the question of\nwhether he is deportable remains very much to be decided.\nHe doesn't have any order of deportation.\nQUESTION: Ms. Rabinovitz, why wasn't Judge\nFletcher absolutely right in rejecting that claim?\nBecause the language is when the alien is released from\ncriminal custody.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Because --\nQUESTION: The statute directs custody when the\nalien is released from criminal custody, and not at some\nlater time, not at the time of the issuance of a removal\norder.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: Because I think that what Judge\nFletcher was not aware of is that the whole regime right\nnow that the Immigration Service has is to conduct\ndeportation proceedings while individuals are still\nserving their criminal sentence, which makes complete\nsense, because then you do not have this problem. People\nare already ordered deported, determined deportable while\nthey are still in jail. And so the --\nQUESTION: But still, if the statute says when\nreleased from criminal custody, even before release, but\nit doesn't say at the later time of the final removal\norder.\nMS. RABINOVITZ: There's two different issues,\nJustice Ginsburg. One is when -- is deportable. It says,\nwhen released. Our point is only that there are\nindividuals who have deportation proceedings while they're\nin prison, and there will be an immigration judge decision\nor a BIA decision that says they are deportable.\nNow, they may still be seeking review of that\ndecision in the Federal courts, in which case, that\ndecision is not final and they would not fit under the\nnext statute, the statute that you -- that this Court\nconstrued in -- in Zadvydas, which was 1241, but they\nwould -- or excuse me -- 1231. But they would still have\nan order of deportation, and then, that would be a way to\nsay that individual is deportable.\nWhereas, here you have a situation where anybody\nwho the Government charges with being deportable -- in\nthis case, our client, even though he may not actually be\ndeportable -- is subject to mandatory detention for\npossibly a year, 2 years, however long.\nI see my time is up.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Rabinovitz.\nMr. Olson, General Olson, you have 4 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nQUESTION: General Olson, I don't want to\nintrude upon your rebuttal time, but I have one question\nthat's very important for me and you can answer it yes or\nno. Assuming I disagree with you as to the reading of the\nstatute as to whether there is jurisdiction in this case,\nif there is no jurisdiction, is that provision of the\nstatute in the view of the Government unconstitutional?\nMR. OLSON: No. Now, we haven't briefed and\nstudied that and -- and I have to rely on the answer that\nI gave before. But I think that that would be a correct\nwith -- it would be within the power of Congress to do\nthat under certain circumstances.\nQUESTION: Well, you can rely on the presumption\nof constitutionality if you haven't briefed it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: Well, then I would've have to answer\nthe question differently.\nWell, if -- I guess no, I guess I would --\nthat -- that's a good answer.\nLet me -- let me --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: Let me just deal with a few things\nthat were raised during my colleague's argument.\nFirst of all, the date of the offense that's\ninvolved in this case was after the enactment of this\nstatute. On page 8 of the respondent's brief, it is\nasserted that he was convicted of petty theft with priors\nand sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment in 1997. That was\nwhen that conviction took place.\nSecondly -- and I think a lot of time has been\nexpended with respect to the question that focused in\nlarge part by Justice Breyer. What happens if it's not\nthe individual? What happens if he's really a citizen?\nWhat happens if he wants to challenge whether this crime\nwas one that should be covered?\nAs we said on page 26 -- and we cite the\nrelevant provision of the INS regulations -- those types\nof things can be challenged in an individualized bond\nhearing at which the -- which is what the Ninth Circuit\nwas talking about and which is what our opponents are\ntalking about here, and that those issues may be raised at\nthat point, which is precisely what the respondents are\ntalking about. So that's already built into the statute.\nNow, one might quarrel with whether -- what the\nburden of proof is, and where it should be and how it\nshould be written, but that's a -- this is a determination\nby the executive branch with respect to the statute. If\nthe alien can show that the INS is substantially unlikely\nto prevail on its underlying charge of removability, then\nthe individual may be released on bond. If the decision\ngoes against the individual, that can be taken to the\nBoard of Immigration Appeals. So there's a process that\ntakes care of precisely those -- that category 2, as you\nput it.\nNow, that does not deal with the question of\ndangerousness or risk of flight, but that's what Congress\nwas concerned about when it -- when it enacted the\nstatute. Congress was concerned about a situation in\nwhich large numbers of individuals who commit serious\ncrimes -- and Congress went to the effort of define what\nit thought -- defining what it thought was serious crimes.\nNow, if there is some question about that in an\nindividual case, or if there's some question about an\naberrational lengthy detention, that should be brought to\nthis Court or the courts below in an as-applied challenge.\nThe respondent is saying here today that this is an\nas-applied challenge, but that has never been the way this\ncase has been litigated from the petition, which I cited\nas a facial challenge, through the district court's\ndecision to the -- to the as -- the -- the facial\nchallenge in part of the decision of the Ninth Circuit.\nThis has been a challenge to the congressional\ndetermination that people who commit serious crimes are\nto -- to be deportable as rapidly as possible.\nThey -- and -- and to the -- in order for that\npolicy to be effectuated, for our borders to be protected,\nto avoid the acculturation of a criminal alien class in\nthe United States that's operating freely, for a limited\nperiod of time, that individual will be detained during\nthat process until the final order of deportation is\nentered.\n85 percent of the aliens that are brought into\nthese procedures don't even challenge the immigration\ndecision -- immigration judge decision, and more than half\nof those cases are resolved within 30 days. The\nstatistics are in the brief.\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Olson.\nMR. OLSON: Thank you.\n"

        "The point is that this statute requires the Government to detain individuals like our client who are lawful permanent residents not because their detention is necessary to protect the public from danger of flight risk, but merely because they were convicted in the past for one of a broad range of crimes that the Government believes may render them deportable.

You -- that it's not -- since the Government is not substantially unlikely to prevail on the charge. I think it's important to recognize that there are many individuals who are subjected to mandatory detention under this statute who cannot satisfy that standard. and the court has held the Government substantially -- you know, we can't show that the Government is substantially unlikely to prevail. QUESTION", 
        "I mean, I have a reason. I mean, now I am -- I'm confused on this and I'd appreciate it. I -- I assume there is someone in prison. He's detained like your client. There's a class of people. There are two subgroups. Group 1 is a group that has no non-frivolous argument that they shouldn't be deported. It's virtually conceded they're -- they should be deported. Their only arguments against it are frivolous. Group 2 are people who have a real non-frivolous argument -- a real non- frivolous argument -- that they aren't -- it's the wrong person, this crime doesn't fall within the statutory definition, I probably will get asylum, something like that. They have a real non-frivolous argument. Now, I thought that what we were talking about, at least in part, was that people in this group 2 were being held without bail. Now, am I right? Because I think what I heard the Solicitor General say is I'm wrong. We're only talking about people in group 1. MS. RABINOVITZ",

        "But aren't there one-and-a-half or -- there's this Joseph hearing. It's not just that either you have a hearing or you don't have a hearing. You have the hearing that Justice Souter was referring to where your burden is enormous because you will not succeed at that hearing if you show it's more likely than not that this crime is -- doesn't qualify as serious.

You're -- you're not just asking for individualized hearings on whether you are the person that did the -- that -- that was convicted and whether the -- the crime of conviction causes you to be deportable. You want a hearing on whether, if you are let go, you will show up for -- for a later hearing. And I don't see why -- why that is necessary -- MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "Yes -- QUESTION",

        "Let me try -- let me try to explain how the statute works and why we believe that it's a problem. The -- the proceeding that you're asking for, a determination about whether, in fact, an individual is deportable, is precisely what a deportation hearing is for, and that kind of decision is not made the first time you come before an immigration judge. It's often a very protracted process, and we have individuals who have -- who have been in jail for 17 months pending an immigration judge hearing to determine that exact question, Justice Scalia, about whether they are, in fact, deportable, which is why we say that the relevant question is whether pending those proceedings, there's a regulatory purpose in detaining that individual.

We don't allow people to be locked up based on averages. QUESTION",

In Carlson, what this Court did is it upheld the Attorney General's discretionary decision that five individuals could be detained because there was -- that -- the decision to detain them was with not -- was not without reasonable foundation. It was a discretionary decision. It's wholly different from this case. What makes this statute so unique and so unprecedented is that the Government is prohibited. There's no discretion here.

        "Justice Breyer's classification of people who have really serious claims and people who have frivolous claims -- surely a claim that first degree burglary is not deportable under the statute would verge on the frivolous. MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "Mr. Chief Justice, I need to -- to disagree with you. It's unclear. To decide whether this is -- is an aggravated felony, the Court is going to need to look at the specific language of the statute. The -- the specific crime that our client committed was he broke and entered into a tool shed and he was convicted under California State law. This is a very complicated, technical area of the law. And all that I can tell you is that if you refer to our brief at page 5, note 6 -- oh, no. Excuse me. That's not the place. To our brief at -- our brief at page 30, note 27, we note numerous examples where the question of whether something is an aggravated felony has been contested and decided -- QUESTION",

        "Right. Right. Right. QUESTION", 
        "In your opinion, would -- would -- and this goes back to my initial question which I'm still -- haven't heard you really answer. Look, on appeal, somebody who has been convicted of a crime, in order to get out on -- on appeal -- have bail on appeal, he has to show not only he wouldn't run away, not only he isn't a danger, but also that he raises a substantial question. Now, suppose that we were to say at least those people who show that they raise a substantial question -- a substantial question -- and it says not for purposes of delay -- that as to those people, you have to have an individualized hearing. MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "In this case, if we're talking about somebody who raises a non-frivolous challenge like our client, that would satisfy this case because this is -- QUESTION", 
        "Well, I'm not saying if it'd satisfy the case, though I take it from what you say it would satisfy you and your position. MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "Your Honor, I misspoke. What I meant is that in this case, this is an as-applied challenge. It's a -- it's a challenge about whether this statute as applied to our client who's a lawful permanent resident, who has bona fide challenges that he is not deportable and is eligible for relief from deportation, that in this case, applying the statute to him is unconstitutional. QUESTION", 
        "So to keep someone in prison without bail, after they've been convicted of something, pending a deportation order is not constitutional without an individualized hearing at least if -- or don't say at least -- if, among other things, he shows there is a substantial question not for purposes of delay. Imagine an opinion that said that. Would you argue for or against that opinion? MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "I would argue for that opinion in this case because it would resolve this case. I believe that there also might be -- there would be a constitutional issue that even somebody else -- due process requires that they have an opportunity to show that they're not a danger and a flight risk because that is the purpose of regulatory detention. And as the -- QUESTION", 
        "I -- I note that you have redefined substantial question as non-frivolous. Anything that's not sanctionable raises a substantial question for purposes of -- of this new rule? MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "Yes, Your Honor -- QUESTION", 
        "Wow. MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "-- and -- and it has to be that way because there are so many examples of circuit courts finding that the board's decision about what constitutes a deportable offense is wrong and yet, that those were cases where the individual could -- where their -- their claim might have been considered bordering on the frivolous, even though it wasn't. And let give you a very -- QUESTION", 
        "That -- that is true but all -- MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "Let me give you an example. QUESTION", 
        "-- all of -- at least for people who have committed their crimes after this statute was enacted, it seems to me that they are on notice. If you get convicted of a felony, your -- your welcome in this country is at an end if it's an aggravated felony, and you will be held until it is -- it is finally determined whether that is, indeed, an aggravated felony or not. I don't know that that's terribly unfair. MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "But your question presupposes the answer. You're saying -- QUESTION", 
        "No, it doesn't. of the risks you take when you commit a felony. Your -- it's -- it's part of -- of the condition of your admittance to this country. Once this statute is passed, any lawful resident alien knows that if he commits a felony and it's an aggravated felony, he will be deported. MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "Two points. QUESTION", 
        "And -- and until the question of whether it is an aggravated felony, assuming it's at least arguable, is decided, he will be held in custody and not permitted to be at large in this country. Now, that doesn't strike me as terribly unreasonable. Just don't do the felony. MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "Well, two points, Your Honor. First, in this case, the conviction that is now being considered as possibly an aggravated felony was committed before the statute took effect. So even under Your Honor's proposal, the statute could not apply to him. In terms of what you're suggesting, though, if Congress was to say that anybody who -- there still is an issue of whether somebody is, in fact, deportable, and to condition -- and -- and this Court has recognized that individuals who are facing deportation, particularly lawful permanent residents, have a right to a fair hearing. To say that those individuals must give up their right to physical liberty -- QUESTION", 
        "Well, but there's no question that these people are going to get a fair hearing eventually. The question you're challenging is whether they should be -- be incarcerated pending that hearing. So we're not talking about a fair hearing. MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "You're right, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice. But the -- the point is that if somebody is locked up for a year-and-a-half, and they can't get the evidence for their case, because being locked up in jails also makes it much harder for people to present their cases, there's no right to appointed counsel. It means they can't work. There are -- and this is, again, where I would like to refer you, just in general, to the amicus brief by the Citizens and Immigrants for Equal Justice which points out other cases where individuals gave up their claims because otherwise they were going to be in detention for so long. And let me just point out one other -- QUESTION", 
        "Well, you -- you've got someone who is an alien here. The alien has committed a felony. I mean, it's difficult to -- for me to say that they should have all these additional benefits so that somehow they can avoid deportation. MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "Mr. Chief Justice, this -- it's not only for people who are convicted of felonies. Even the definition -- QUESTION", 
        "Well, but that's with the case we're dealing of here. MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "Okay, but the -- the question is what -- what constitutes an aggravated felony. Misdemeanors constitute an aggravated felony as well. You're right. In this case, the initial conviction -- QUESTION", 
        "What -- what do you -- what do you mean, misdemeanors constitute an aggravated felony? MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "I know it's somewhat shocking, Mr. Chief Justice, but, in fact, the way that aggravated felony has been defined so broadly -- QUESTION", 
        "Well -- MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "-- the courts have held that even misdemeanors can be aggravated felonies. QUESTION", 
        "But there's no question that first degree burglary is not a misdemeanor. So, in our case, that's not -- we don't have to worry about that, do we? MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "But let me return to the point about whether it's -- whether due process is satisfied by requiring that somebody be mandatorily detained throughout the process of their deportation proceeding, a process which, as I said, can be months, often years, without any individualized determination of danger and flight risk. And the example that I wanted to give ties back with this Court's decision in St. Cyr, which said that 212(c) relief was available to individuals whose convictions -- who had pled guilty prior to -- to the statute having taken effect. All of those individuals were subject to mandatory detention under the statute. Their claim would have been considered close to frivolous until the Supreme Court ruled differently. QUESTION", 
        "Well, that's -- that's -- I mean, your argument to me rings true for people who have real claims, but if you're trying to apply it to a person who has an insubstantial claim or a claim that is interposed for purposes of delay, I'm tempted to say, well, there's a very good reason to keep him locked up, namely, he doesn't have any argument and he's about to be deported and -- and if he wants to be deported quickly, he can be. MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "Your Honor, that's -- QUESTION", 
        "But if he has a substantial claim, it's different. MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "Your Honor, I think it's important to recognize that that's precisely the kind of factors that the Immigration Service and the immigration judge looks at when they make a determination whether somebody should be released on bond. They -- when they're determining flight risk, that's precisely what they look at. They say, oh, this is a frivolous -- this is a frivolous claim. We're not going to release this person on bond because they're not going to show up. And we're not saying that individuals in that situation should be released from detention. All that we're saying is that an individual needs to be given some opportunity to demonstrate, look, I was convicted of this crime, but I have claims for relief. I'm not a flight risk. I'm not a danger. QUESTION", 
        "Would you say that -- MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "And I think it's important to look at -- QUESTION", 
        "Would you agree that the alien has the burden of showing that? MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "Your Honor, we have no -- QUESTION", 
        "In your -- in your regime, you would -- would there be any problem putting the burden on the alien to show that? MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "We have no problem with Congress creating a presumption that individuals who are charged with these kinds of -- with being deportable for these kinds of crimes are a danger and are a flight risk, and that they need to come forward to show that they're not. And in fact -- QUESTION", 
        "minute. But insofar as the substantiality or -- or the likelihood of prevailing -- forget about flight risk for a moment. Insofar as the likelihood of prevailing and the substantiality of the -- of the issue, that's almost what the statute already provides for in a bail determination hearing, as set forth on page 26 of the Government's brief. A person in INS custody is -- is entitled to a bond determination hearing. And the standard is whether or not the Government is -- he has to show the Government is substantially unlikely to prevail. That's very -- forget flight risk for a moment. That is very close to the regime that you propose. So I don't see what we're arguing about here as to that. Now, if you want to say that you're entitled to release if you're not a flight risk, that's something quite different. And I would -- and I would doubt the latter, but -- MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "Let me try to clarify what I believe is some confusion about what that hearing does. The hearing essentially just shows you need to show that the Government has no frivolous claim. That's essentially what you need to show. I mean, you have to show that the Government had -- that the Government's charge is frivolous. And I would assume that the Government is not putting people into proceedings if they have no possible argument. But to require that an individual be locked up throughout the whole deportation process just because they cannot show that the Government has a -- has a frivolous claim, that doesn't satisfy due process. In terms of burden, Your Honor, what I was referring to -- what I thought you were referring to is whether an individual is going to have an obligation to show that they're not a danger of flight risk. But even -- QUESTION", 
        "Well, perhaps that's why I asked you that question first. It -- it does seem to me that if you concede that he has the burden, that that is really very, very close to what the -- the statute already provides, forgetting about flight risk for the moment, or -- or -- MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "Yes, Your Honor. I don't -- I don't see it that way. I see that the question about if you need -- if an individual has to prove that the Government's argument is frivolous, that's not the same thing as showing that you have a non-frivolous claim. And that's all that we're saying. I think that they're completely different. One is showing that the Government's argument is frivolous. I don't -- most of the cases where individuals were found not deportable, it wasn't that the Government's claim was frivolous, but those individuals prevailed in their proceedings. And that's the issue here, whether -- whether an individual can be detained for a substantial period of time without any opportunity to show that -- that there's no purpose that's served by their detention. And I think that -- that this case is a perfect example because in this case, once the district court -- our client was detained for 6 months without any individualized determination. The district court then said due process requires an individualized determination, and the INS, the Immigration Service, on its own decided he poses no danger and he can be released on 5,000-dollar bond. And he's been out for the past 3-and-a-half years. He's now getting his college degree. He's working. If the Government prevails in this appeal, it will have no choice but to re-incarcerate him throughout his proceedings. It's not a question of discretion like Carlson, where they can make that determination. And going back to your question about burden, I think it's important to recognize that the regime that was in place prior to this statute, and that is now in place in those circuits where they've said that the statute needs to be interpreted to -- or that the statute -- due process requires an individualized determination, still requires that an individual show that they are not a danger of flight risk. They bear that burden. And so under this system, no individual who's a danger of flight risk is going to be released except for those cases where there's, you know, obviously going to be error. But in general, individuals who are a danger of flight risk aren't going to be released. I think it -- there's one last point that I would like to make because I realize my time is short, which is that this case poses a serious constitutional problem, and we believe that there is a way that this Court can avoid that problem by construing the statute to not apply to individuals like our client who are, in fact, not deportable. The statute says that individuals shall be mandatorily detained. An individual who is deportable on one of these grounds is subject to mandatory detention. As we've been talking about here, in fact, the question of whether he is deportable remains very much to be decided. He doesn't have any order of deportation. QUESTION", 
        "Ms. Rabinovitz, why wasn't Judge Fletcher absolutely right in rejecting that claim? Because the language is when the alien is released from criminal custody. MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "Because -- QUESTION", 
        "The statute directs custody when the alien is released from criminal custody, and not at some later time, not at the time of the issuance of a removal order. MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "Because I think that what Judge Fletcher was not aware of is that the whole regime right now that the Immigration Service has is to conduct deportation proceedings while individuals are still serving their criminal sentence, which makes complete sense, because then you do not have this problem. People are already ordered deported, determined deportable while they are still in jail. And so the -- QUESTION", 
        "But still, if the statute says when released from criminal custody, even before release, but it doesn't say at the later time of the final removal order. MS. RABINOVITZ", 
        "There's two different issues, Justice Ginsburg. One is when -- is deportable. It says, when released. Our point is only that there are individuals who have deportation proceedings while they're in prison, and there will be an immigration judge decision or a BIA decision that says they are deportable. Now, they may still be seeking review of that decision in the Federal courts, in which case, that decision is not final and they would not fit under the next statute, the statute that you -- that this Court construed in -- in Zadvydas, which was 1241, but they would -- or excuse me -- 1231. But they would still have an order of deportation, and then, that would be a way to say that individual is deportable. Whereas, here you have a situation where anybody who the Government charges with being deportable -- in this case, our client, even though he may not actually be deportable -- is subject to mandatory detention for possibly a year, 2 years, however long. I see my time is up. QUESTION", 
        "Thank you, Ms. Rabinovitz. Mr. Olson, General Olson, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS QUESTION", 
        "General Olson, I don't want to intrude upon your rebuttal time, but I have one question that's very important for me and you can answer it yes or no. Assuming I disagree with you as to the reading of the statute as to whether there is jurisdiction in this case, if there is no jurisdiction, is that provision of the statute in the view of the Government unconstitutional? MR. OLSON", 
        "No. Now, we haven't briefed and studied that and -- and I have to rely on the answer that I gave before. But I think that that would be a correct with -- it would be within the power of Congress to do that under certain circumstances. QUESTION", 
        "Well, you can rely on the presumption of constitutionality if you haven't briefed it. (Laughter.) MR. OLSON", 
        "Well, then I would've have to answer the question differently. Well, if -- I guess no, I guess I would -- that -- that's a good answer. Let me -- let me -- (Laughter.) MR. OLSON", 
        "Let me just deal with a few things that were raised during my colleague's argument. First of all, the date of the offense that's involved in this case was after the enactment of this statute. On page 8 of the respondent's brief, it is asserted that he was convicted of petty theft with priors and sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment in 1997. That was when that conviction took place. Secondly -- and I think a lot of time has been expended with respect to the question that focused in large part by Justice Breyer. What happens if it's not the individual? What happens if he's really a citizen? What happens if he wants to challenge whether this crime was one that should be covered? As we said on page 26 -- and we cite the relevant provision of the INS regulations -- those types of things can be challenged in an individualized bond hearing at which the -- which is what the Ninth Circuit was talking about and which is what our opponents are talking about here, and that those issues may be raised at that point, which is precisely what the respondents are talking about. So that's already built into the statute. Now, one might quarrel with whether -- what the burden of proof is, and where it should be and how it should be written, but that's a -- this is a determination by the executive branch with respect to the statute. If the alien can show that the INS is substantially unlikely to prevail on its underlying charge of removability, then the individual may be released on bond. If the decision goes against the individual, that can be taken to the Board of Immigration Appeals. So there's a process that takes care of precisely those -- that category 2, as you put it. Now, that does not deal with the question of dangerousness or risk of flight, but that's what Congress was concerned about when it -- when it enacted the statute. Congress was concerned about a situation in which large numbers of individuals who commit serious crimes -- and Congress went to the effort of define what it thought -- defining what it thought was serious crimes. Now, if there is some question about that in an individual case, or if there's some question about an aberrational lengthy detention, that should be brought to this Court or the courts below in an as-applied challenge. The respondent is saying here today that this is an as-applied challenge, but that has never been the way this case has been litigated from the petition, which I cited as a facial challenge, through the district court's decision to the -- to the as -- the -- the facial challenge in part of the decision of the Ninth Circuit. This has been a challenge to the congressional determination that people who commit serious crimes are to -- to be deportable as rapidly as possible. They -- and -- and to the -- in order for that policy to be effectuated, for our borders to be protected, to avoid the acculturation of a criminal alien class in the United States that's operating freely, for a limited period of time, that individual will be detained during that process until the final order of deportation is entered. 85 percent of the aliens that are brought into these procedures don't even challenge the immigration decision -- immigration judge decision, and more than half of those cases are resolved within 30 days. The statistics are in the brief. QUESTION",
