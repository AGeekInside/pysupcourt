        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear\nargument first this morning in Case 09-497,\nRent-A-Center West v. Jackson.\nMr. Friedman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT F. FRIEDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe agreement between Antonio Jackson and\nRent-A-Center should be enforced as written. There is\nno statutory impediment to the enforcement of the clear\nand unmistakable agreement that gives the arbitrator\nexclusive authority to decide Jackson's challenge to\nenforceability, nor is there any language in the Federal\nArbitration Act that would prohibit the court from\nmaking the determination -- prohibit the arbitrator from\nmaking the determination of Jackson's challenge to\nunconscionability.\nThrough frequent holdings of this Court\ngoing back 50 years to the Steelworkers trilogy, this\nCourt has plainly recognized that parties may delegate\nissues as to scope and validity to the arbitrator in the\nfirst instance. The district court and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But not to the\nquestion of which parties have agreed to arbitrate?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not the question of\nwhich parties have agreed to arbitrate?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Which parties can be\npotentially scope issues and which parties potentially\nas well. In this case, the issue is enforceability.\nAnd through the holdings of First Options, Howsam, and\nBazzle, going back to previous decisions, this Court has\nheld that parties through clear and unmistakable\ndelegation can give that to the arbitrator in the first\ninstance.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if -- if fraud in the\ninducement, I take it, is considered -- even if you have\na very broad arbitration clause, as we do here, fraud in\nthe inducement is considered a question for the court,\nnot the arbitrator; is that right?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So why should\nunconscionability be treated differently?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Ginsburg, fraud in\nthe inducement, pursuant to Prima Paint, goes to the\nmaking of the agreement, and under section 4, the court\nretains decisions over the making of the agreement.\nUnconscionability is a post-formation attack. It does\nnot go to the very limited inquiry that is anticipated\nunder section 4, of the making --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why is it post-formation?\nArguably, the -- one of the parties has such a strong\nhand that it forces the other party just to decide.\nIt's almost like -- duress would certainly be for the\ncourt, would it not, if it's a formation issue like\nJustice Ginsburg indicated?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: In some instances,\nJustice Kennedy, duress could be; for example, a gun to\nsomebody's head. But procedural unconscionability does\nnot go to the same issues of making. And, in fact, under\nNevada law and this State's laws --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure what\nprocedural unconscionability, but this is -- as Justice\nGinsburg indicates, it's not clear to me why this isn't\na formation issue.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Formation is a very basic\nexistential analysis. It goes to mutual assent. Did\nthe parties sign the agreement and indicate the desire\nto be bound by the agreement? Though --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess you could argue\nthat on its face the agreement is so one-sided, so\nunconscionable, that one of the parties must have been\ncoerced into signing it. I guess you could make that\nargument, can't -- couldn't you?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Scalia, you could\nmake that argument --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Has -- has that argument\nbeen made here?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: There was an argument made\nthat it was one-sided, but it was the same type of\nargument that pertains --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was the argument made that\nbecause it was so unconscionable, the employee must have\nbeen coerced into making it?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: No, Justice Scalia. That\nargument was not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't think it -- it had\nbeen made.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Getting back to\nJustice Ginsburg's question about making --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm a little puzzled.\nWhat was the argument that was made? Why was it\nunconscionable, if not for that reason?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Stevens, the argument\nwas that there was unequal bargaining power because\nMr. Jackson was the -- a putative employee and Rent-A-Center\nwas the employer. He also complained about a couple of\nthe provisions in the agreement, one pertaining to\ndiscovery, one pertaining to an alleged fee-splitting\nprovision in the agreement. He did not complain as to\nthe terms that Justice Scalia just referred to.\nWith respect to making, it is a very limited\ninquiry, and section 4 is the provision in the Federal\nArbitration Act that gives a court the power to\nenforce the arbitration agreement. Once the court is\nsatisfied that the making is not an issue and the making\nis a very basic issue, the court, pursuant to the plain\nlanguage of section 4, must submit the dispute to\narbitration.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You have --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Now, in some instances, the\ncourts will make decisions as to attacks such as\nunconscionability. But in this sense --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, is your problem\nwith unconscionability being -- as described by the Chief\nJustice or Justice Scalia, being forced to or coerced\ninto signing something -- that's okay for the courts, but\nthis type of argument that goes to the unfairness of the\nprocess, that's for the arbitrator; is that your\nposition?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: That's -- that's right, Justice\nSotomayor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why -- isn't that an\nunwieldy rule? Isn't your quarrel with what the court\ndefined as remissible unconscionability as a legal\nmatter, as opposed to trying to parse out what\nunconscionability means otherwise?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Well, Justice Sotomayor,\nunconscionability and fairness attacks go to\npost-formation issues that -- that are --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We just gave you one\nthat didn't: If someone was forced into signing the\nagreement in an unconscionable way.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: But, Justice Sotomayor, if\nfor example it's fraud in the inducement, such as in\nPrima Paint, that does go to the section 4. It does go\nto the making of the agreement because there would not\nbe mutual assent if somebody was forced to enter into\nthe agreement.\nIn contrast, unconscionability, and\ncertainly the allegations we've seen here against the\nagreement, go to post-formation complaints, complaints\nabout the fairness of the agreement. They do not go to\nthe actual, very limited making of the agreement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I suppose that\nthe substance of the agreement -- maybe this is just the\nsame question as Justice Scalia's. I suppose the\nsubstance of the agreement is evidence -- could be\nevidence on the unconscionability at formation.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that is for the\ncourt.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: If -- if there is something\nin the agreement that would indicate that there was not\nmutual assent, as in somebody put a gun to somebody's\nhead, somebody forced them to do it, that would be for\nthe court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, the point is --\nit's not that. It would be the -- the provisions are so\none-sided that you may assume from that that the\nformation was not voluntary.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: No, Mr. Chief Justice.\nAttacks on the fairness and simply pointing to\nprovisions and saying, well, these are very unfair; it\nmust be an indication of it being forced -- no, that would\nbe for the arbitrator to decide, because it's simply an\nattack on the fairness and there's speculation as to why\nsomebody entered. And in this agreement --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't agree with that. I\nmean, if -- if the argument is made -- I gather it\nwasn't made here, but if the argument is made that this\nagreement was not voluntary, and the evidence of that\ninvoluntariness is how outrageously unfair it is -- now,\nI'm not sure that that's enough evidence. You may need\nsome other stuff as well to -- to persuade a court.\nBut if that is the argument, that the\none-sidedness is evidence that the agreement was not\nvoluntary, I don't see how that's for the arbitrator.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Scalia, under the\nsection 4 analysis, in the making there needs to be some\nevidence that it was forced, the gun to the head\nexample. Simply pointing to the language in the\nagreement as evidence of that would not be enough. That\nis an attack on the language of the agreement after it's\nbeen formed.\nThe section 4 analysis is very, very limited,\nand it goes to these most basic elements. So the\nlanguage of the agreement, while certainly the party\nopposing it will have the opportunity to make the\nargument it's unconscionable, but that would be for the\narbitrator.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't think that could\nbe used along with other evidence? I think all you're\nsaying is that it is not in and of itself enough, that\nevery unfair agreement is not a coerced agreement.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: It certainly would not in and\nof itself be enough --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you could use it as\nevidence if there's other evidence supporting that.\nCouldn't you?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Your Honor, you would have to\nlook at the objective manifestation of mutual assent.\nFor example, in this agreement --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think you can answer that\nyes or no. Can you use that in addition to other\nevidence to show that the agreement was not voluntary?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Scalia, I don't think\nso. I think you would have to look to what transpired\nat the time the agreement was actually entered into and\nwas made.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And that's no matter how\none-sided? I mean, suppose the agreement provided that\nthe employee shall pay all the costs of arbitration no\nmatter who wins and also at the end of the arbitration\nshall pay a penalty if he fails to -- it seems to me you\ncould have a really one-sided -- that would not be\nadmissible on the issue?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Stevens, if there is\nan issue about arbitral access, as in there is a block\nat the door, you cannot get a ticket to the show,\nbecause of some impediment in getting to arbitration in\nthe first place, under the Court's principles announced\nin Randolph and in First Options, you must have access to\nthe arbitrator. So in your example, if there is\nsomething prohibiting access to the arbitrator, that\nwould be a different story.\nGetting back to Justice Scalia's question\nabout the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the specific\nexamples he gave, that the -- just take that the -- that\nthe employee must bear all the costs of the arbitration,\nwin or lose, that's the provision. Would that provision\nbe enough to make the issue one for the court rather\nthan the arbitrator?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Ginsburg, if it's\nsimply a complaint about the fairness, it would not be.\nIf the parties --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But is it? We don't need\nthe \"if.\" Tell me whether you think a provision saying\nthe employee under any and all circumstances pays all\ncosts -- would that provision make this question of\nunconscionability one for the court rather than the\narbitrator?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: It could, Justice Ginsburg.\nIt would not be a question of arbitrability if the party\nopposing arbitration can meet the very heavy burden\nestablished in Randolph to show that the fees would\nbe -- would prohibit them from actually getting to\narbitration. It would not be simply an attack as we saw\nhere, with no evidence, that we think a term is unfair.\nThe party opposing arbitration would have to\nmeet their burden. They would have to put evidence in.\nAnd, for example, in Randolph the Court stated that in\ncertain instances Mrs. Randolph could have put evidence\nin, and had she put evidence in, which she did not, much\nas in this case, if she had met her burden to show that\nshe could not have access to arbitration -- in other\nwords, if arbitration is an illusory remedy -- that\ncould be for the court to decide, because, after all,\neven in the First Options decision, the anticipation is\nyou have a clear and unmistakably delegation that the\narbitrator will make a decision, and implicit in that\nthat there is an arbitrator to make that decision.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's -- that's true.\nThe thing I was wondering in this case is there's a -- a\ndispute that's about racial discrimination and so forth.\nThere's a clause, and the clause says this is\narbitrable, but that is being disputed because the\nplaintiff in the case says that's an unconscionable\nprovision, so it doesn't really apply. And then you say\nbut now that dispute is referred to the arbitrator to\njust read the language. But the plaintiff says that\nthat language, too, is unconscionable, and as long as\nthat language is unconscionable, then how is it clear\nand unmistakable that they, he, agreed to do it, because\nan unconscionable provision is not a provision?\nSo if we apply First Options -- I mean, it's\ncomplicated because of the language; it's not\ncomplicated once you think it out, and -- I hope. But\njust applying it very literally, it would seem to say\nthat you do not have clear and unmistakable evidence\nthat they agreed to submit this kind of dispute to\narbitration for the reason that what you point to is\nitself according to them a product of unconscionability.\nHow do you -- how do you respond to that?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Breyer, under section\n4, which is the enforcement mechanism, the court is\nlimited to make decisions about the making. Once the\nmaking issue is not an issue -- and it has never been an\nissue in this case; there has never been an allegation\nthe making has been affected -- the court at that\npoint should enforce the agreement pursuant to its\nterms.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, making itself\ncould be, but I think that's a harder question,\nwhether a -- certainly if the person says you see my\nsignature there; that's not mine; that's Joe Banana's,\nwho tries to imitate me -- there is no contract, and no\nmatter what it says, it doesn't go to the arbitrator.\nAll right?\nNow, we can argue about whether it is or is\nnot analogous to that when he claims it's\nunconscionable. There's a very good argument it is\nanalogous. There's a very good argument it is like\nfraud in the inducement, and there are some arguments\nthe other way.\nBut First Options I think cuts through that,\nby saying whether that's true or not, unless it's clear\nand unmistakable that they wanted this matter, the\nmatter of whether the arbitration clause itself is\nunconscionable referred to the arbitrator, whether or\nnot they wanted that referred to the arbitrator has to\nbe clear and unmistakable. And they are claiming no,\nbecause the lack -- the provision that says that is\nitself a product of unconscionability. That's to repeat\nmy question. But, having repeated the question, why\nisn't that the simplest, most direct, and four-sentence\nground for deciding this case?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Breyer, Jackson, first\nand foremost, did not ever complain that the arbitrability\nprovision, the clear and unmistakable delegation provision,\nis unconscionable.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He's not saying that this\nwhole arbitration clause is unconscionable?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: He's complaining that\ngenerally it's unconscionable --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, all right. So he's\n-- he's complaining the whole clause is unconscionable,\nand that's part of the clause.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Breyer, this is really\nvery similar to First Options, in which the party said:\nI'm not party to the agreement; the scope does not\ncover --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and in First Options, we\nsaid it wasn't clear and unmistakable.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: The Court said it was not,\nbut in First Options the Court set out the rule --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the rules were what I\njust described.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: The rule is -- in this case,\nthere is language that has never been contested, and that\nlanguage clearly and unmistakably says that the\narbitrator has exclusive authority. That language has\nnever been attacked.\nAnd as to the issue of unconscionability,\npursuant to section 4, which gives the court the\nauthority to send the arbitration to the arbitrator, the\ncourt should do exactly that. It should send it to the\narbitrator once the making issue is satisfied, and then\nthe arbitrator can make that decision.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your position is\nthat the arbitrator gets to decide questions of\nunconscionability, but the court gets to decide whether\nthe arbitrator can do that?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: In some instances, Justice\nRoberts -- Mr. Chief Justice, that is correct. The court\nmust decide whether the agreement is made. The court\nmust also decide whether there was a clear and\nunmistakable delegation. So under First Options and the\ncases that interpret it and the cases before it, the\ncourt must make the initial determination of whether\nthere is a clear and unmistakable delegation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do you understand --\nand we can ask the Respondent. But, as you understand\nJackson's case, is he saying that part of the clause,\npart of the arbitration clause, is unconscionable, that\nthe whole clause is unconscionable or that the whole\ncontract is unconscionable?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: He has made generalized --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because the complaint is a\nbare-bones complaint, and I don't know if there's\nanything in the pleadings that reflects what his answer\nto that question would be.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Kennedy, he has\nattacked certain provisions specifically of the\nagreement. He is arguing about the discovery provision.\nHe is arguing about the fees provision. And he is arguing\nabout certain terms excluding claims, that bilaterally\nexclude claims. So he has attacked about three\nprovisions of the agreement specifically.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But all of the\narbitration agreement, not the employment contract as a\nwhole.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Ginsburg, it is a\nstand-alone four-page arbitration agreement. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So let's go back to that.\nMaybe the other way is simpler. You say you agree that\nif my defense to this contract, which you are trying to\nenforce against me or which gives me a right to sue you,\nlook at the argument, you put up this four-page\ndocument, and I say: Look, that is not my signature;\nthat is the signature of Joe Bananas. We agree that's\nfor the court.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: We agree, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, we agree it's\nfor the court if my defense is, what he did is he got me\ndrunk, told me a bunch of lies, and I signed it. I\ngrant it's my signature, but look at how squiggly it is.\nAnd my will was not a free one because I was under the\ninfluence of alcohol and lies.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: We agree --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Same. Okay.\nThat's Prima Paint.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: -- because that's part of\nthe fraud issue.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay? Now, he\nsays the reason that I did not sign this contract -- I\nagree it's my signature; I agree it is not squiggly -- but\nstill my will was overborne. What was it overborne by?\nIt was overborne by those very situations that lead\ncourts to label contracts unconscionable. The reason we\ndon't enforce unconscionable contract is because the\nperson who was the victim had no free will. He did not\nsign it of his own accord. And that doesn't -- there's\nno other reason, and that's the basic reason, and\ntherefore assimilate it to the other two. What's your\nresponse?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: No, Justice Breyer, that\nwould be a very different situation. That would be\nallegations of procedural unconscionability, unequal\nbargaining power, and in fact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you agree that a\ncontract cannot be unconscionable unless it was coerced,\nthat a finding of unconscionability is the same as a\nfinding of coercion? You don't agree with that, do you?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: No, there could be other\ntypes of unconscionability.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but that's what I want\nthe answer to. I know you don't agree with it. What I\nwant is a list of reasons why.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: With respect to procedural\nunconscionability, issues of unequal economic bargaining\npower, which is essentially what we have here -- those are\nnon-issues that cannot be addressed by the arbitrator.\nAnd, in fact, under Nevada law, Justice Breyer, an\nallegation of procedural unconscionability, no matter\nhow procedural --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I'm not interested in\narbitration law. I'm interested in contract law, and I\nwant to know why as a general matter of contract law an\nallegation of unconscionability, defense of\nunconscionability, is why is it not enough like the\ncoercion defense or the inducement defense or the \"I was\nin Alaska\" defense? Isn't it enough like that that they\nshould be treated alike? And now you're going to say no,\nand I want to know why not.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: It does not rise to the same\nlevel as something that's fraudulent or something that\nis forced with a gun to your head.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought\nthe answer to your -- the answer to your answer would be,\nwell then, the -- you're more likely to win on that\nquestion. Obviously, you are going to lose on the gun to\nthe head, but if it's simply the economic inequality or\nwhatever, under the State law you're probably going to\nprevail, and they will say there is a valid contract. I\nthought the -- your -- your whole point was simply it's\nall or nothing.\nThe courts get to decide is there a valid\ncontract or is there not. And once they decide there\nis, then everything else about unconscionability of\nparticular clauses is for the arbitrator.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, most\neverything is for the arbitrator, and I want to\ndistinguish between unconscionability, as Justice Breyer\nis referring to, and access issues and issues that go to\nthe making, because there is a very bright line. Making\nissues go to the actual formation, mutual assent, and\nthere is obviously no mutual assent if you have a gun to\nyour head.\nBut issues such as, well, this is unfair, I\nmay have to do this, speculation is simply not enough\nto -- to pertain to the making of the agreement, nor is\nan issue about an impossibly burdensome access to the\narbitration.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can you --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Friedman, this\ncontract is -- is unusual in that, as Judge Hall said,\nit was more employee-friendly than most. It had a\nclause -- it had a provision for back-end review with\nthe court. The review -- at the end of the line, there\nwas to be court review, and as the parties said, it\nshould be just like review of a district court decision,\na much -- much more focused review than would be in the\ncase of an arbitration agreement.\nNow, that clause comes out because of our\ndecision in Hall. That leaves the -- the arbitration\nagreement in -- in an imbalance. There was court review\nassured at the back end. So why isn't it reasonable to\nsay the parties contemplated vigorous court review; if\nit can't be had at the back end, it should be had at the\nfront end?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Ginsburg, there will\nbe court review at the end pursuant to section 10. As a\nresult of Hall Street, section 10 is now the exclusive\nbasis on the tail end --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was very limited\nreview. But the parties to this agreement put in a\nclause that provided for the standard review, not the\nvery limited review that the Arbitration Act calls for.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: That's correct,\nJustice Ginsburg. But by operation of law and because\nof this Court's decision in Hall Street, now the parties\nwill receive the section 10 review, much as they would\nin the First Options case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Once again, has this\nargument been made here? I thought that the only basis\nwas unconscionability. I suppose you could have made\nthe argument that the contract is void because one of\nits essential provisions has been rendered unlawful and,\ntherefore -- and is not severable, and, therefore, the\nwhole contract fails. I suppose you could make that\nargument. That hasn't been made, has it?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Scalia, that's\nabsolutely correct. There has been no argument, in\nfact, at no time -- and it would have -- the proper\nplace would have been the district court -- was any\nevidence ever put into the record --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How could it be in the\ndistrict court? We didn't decide Hall Street until\nafter the district court was finished in this case.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: But, Justice Ginsburg, at the\ndistrict court no evidence of any sort attacking any\nprovision. The only attacks here on the provisions are\nthe arguments that were made by my colleague in the\nbrief --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you were\nmaking, in answer to Justice Scalia, the question -- he\nsaid, well, they didn't raise it. They didn't raise\nthat with this provision out, it was an essential\nprovision, so the contract was void. They had no reason\nto make that in the district court because Hall Street\nwas not yet decided.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Ginsburg, my point\nsimply is they put in no evidence of any sort attacking\nanything. We're simply --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can they make it here now?\nCan they make -- I mean, even if they had -- you know,\neven if there was no reason to make it in the district\ncourt, is the law --\nMR. FRIEDMAN: I -- I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that since they didn't\nhave an opportunity to make it in the district court,\nthey can make it in the Supreme Court?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Scalia, they could\nmake that argument before the arbitrator, and the\narbitrator could make that decision. Under the clear\nand unmistakable delegation, that issue, like other\nissues, should be decided by the arbitrator.\nNobody is contesting -- at least certainly\nnobody contested prior to us getting to the Supreme\nCourt -- both the district court and the Ninth Circuit\nheld that the language was clear and unmistakable.\nThere was never any contest to that issue until we got\nhere. And because of the clear and unmistakable language\nand because the agreement does not implicate the making,\nwe asked the court to enforce the terms of the agreement\nas written and pursuant to Bazzle and Howsam. In\nparticular, in Bazzle the Court recognized that issues as\nto scope and issues as to validity can go to the\narbitrator in the first instance.\nHere, there can be no doubt -- and certainly\nthere was no doubt at the district court level and Ninth\nCircuit -- that the parties clearly and unmistakably gave\nthe arbitrator exclusive authority. And we're asking\nthe Court to give effect to that language.\nThe -- the -- the primary purpose of the\nFederal Arbitration Act is to enforce arbitration\nagreements pursuant to their terms. Here, there's no\nreal dispute about what the terms are. Under section 4,\na limited inquiry, once we have satisfied section 4 the\ncourt should proceed to send us to the arbitrator.\nNobody is arguing that Mr. Jackson can't\nmake these challenges once he gets to arbitration. In\nfact, he certainly can. And the arbitrator will make\nthat decision. And the arbitrator may decide that it is\nunconscionable, in which case he'll set it down. Or\nhe may decide -- or he or she may decide that it's not\nunconscionable, or he or she may decide that certain\nterms are problematic and to sever those.\nAt this point, if there's no other\nquestions, I'd like to reserve my remaining my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Silverberg.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN E. SILVERBERG\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SILVERBERG: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThe Petitioner would have the Court adopt a\nrule whereby agreements to arbitrate are presumed\nenforceable before their validity has been determined by\na court under section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act.\nThey would have people like Mr. Jackson waive their\nright to go to court through the use of a clause\ndelegating this judicial function to the arbitrator.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you describe for\nus what is unconscionable about this contract? What is\nyour claim of unconscionability? He says it's not\narbitration per se; it's just certain of the provisions\nhere; if you change the provisions, I'm happy with\narbitration.\nIs that your position?\nMR. SILVERBERG: Yes, Your Honor, that --\nthat what is unconscionable about this is it's unusually\none-sided in that the issues that are most important to\nMr. Jackson, such as his racial discrimination case, he\nis required to arbitrate, but those issues that might be\nmost important to the Petitioner, such as trade secrets\nand unfair competition, they are not bound to arbitrate.\nSo --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought\nthe issue would be -- it's odd to say, I think, that if\nyou have 10 provisions, some are unconscionable and\nsome are not. The issue would be whether there is\nunconscionability in the making of the whole contract.\nIn other words, it's the same question I asked your\nfriend: Why isn't it all or nothing? If it was -- if\nthere was no unconscionability in the making, then the\narbitrator decides. If there was unconscionability in\nthe making, then -- then the arbitrator doesn't decide\nanything. Questions 1 through 10, not simply, you know,\n1, 8, and 9.\nMR. SILVERBERG: If I understand Your\nHonor's question, the -- the threshold determination\nmust first be made by the court under section 2 as to\nwhether there is unconscionability either of the entire\nagreement or any of the provisions. It would then,\nassuming that were found, that some provisions were in\nfact unconscionable, it would be on State law to\ndetermine whether or not the entire agreement gets\nthrown out --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, my point is that\nonce you get past that gateway question of whether the\nformation of the contract was not unconscionable, then\nclaims that particular provisions were unconscionable\nare by definition for the arbitrator to decide.\nMR. SILVERBERG: No, we would disagree with\nthat, and here's why, Your Honor, and I think this goes\nto something that Justice Sotomayor asked, which is it\ncreates a very difficult rule to deal with. The\nPetitioners here, one, they have made a huge concession,\nwe believe, in their reply brief by saying that if there's\nan illusory remedy, that that is a section of\nunconscionability that the court can hear and must hear.\nBut all these other --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is that -- why is\nthat a big concession, because I thought, as the First\nCircuit said, if argument is the -- the contract is\nillusory, that goes to the court, but here the only\nclaim is unconscionability. That's a question of\nfairness. It doesn't go to the court.\nMR. SILVERBERG: The -- the reason it's a\nconcession is because that's not their original position\nand that's not the question that they presented to this\nCourt.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if they -- if they\nmade that concession, so what, under the First Circuit's\nreading?\nMR. SILVERBERG: The First Circuit, Your\nHonor, we believe did not interpret this correctly.\nThey have, we believe, carved out a section of\nunconscionability law at the exclusion of all other\nunconscionability law.\nWe know that States and Federal courts have\nroutinely applied State unconscionability law, and they\nwould have a rule whereby all this jurisprudence of the\nStates delineating unconscionability law would in\nessence be preempted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that -- is that right?\nIs the arbitrator free to decide unconscionability in a\nvacuum without taking into account State law at all?\nAnd doesn't he get reviewed afterwards by the State\ncourt on the basis of a much more lenient standard\nthan -- than if the court decided it de novo. But can\nhe really disregard State law regarding\nunconscionability?\nMR. SILVERBERG: Well, the problem is, Your\nHonor, and if I understand Your Honor's question\ncorrectly, that determination must of course be made by\nthe court, because the arbitrator doesn't have any\nauthority to do anything until the requirements of\nsection 2 are met. And I hope I'm understanding Your\nHonor's question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No -- I mean, you -- I\nthought you were saying that if we allow this to go to\nthe arbitrator, the arbitrator can simply disregard the\nquestion of unconscionability.\nMR. SILVERBERG: That -- in essence, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's not my\nunderstanding. My understanding is that he's -- he is\nobliged to take account of State law regarding\nunconscionability, but it's going to be his call, as it\nwould be the district judge's call if this had gone to\ncourt, whether in fact this is unconscionable.\nAfterwards, there will be court review. And if he has\ntotally disregarded all State law regarding\nunconscionability, wouldn't -- wouldn't you have a basis\nto set aside the -- the arbitration?\nMR. SILVERBERG: Respectfully, I -- I\ndisagree with that, and here's why, Your Honor: The\nback-end review -- presumably it would be, I believe,\nunder section 10(a)(4) that he exceeded his authority.\nAnd once the arbitrator is empanelled under the\nFederal -- under section 2, once he is authorized to\nmake any decisions at all, including the issue that the\nPetitioner would have him decide of unconscionability\nand arbitrability, it would be impossible for anyone to\nsay he has exceeded his authority.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't mean -- does\nthat mean he can disregard -- let's assume the contract\nis a contract to maim. I mean, it -- you know, it's --\nit's like -- it's a Shylock contract, okay? He's going\nto be able to exact a pound of flesh. Now, there are\nState laws which invalidate contracts to maim. Do you\nthink that the arbitrator can ignore that, and say,\nwell, you know, I don't really think it's so bad; a\npound of flesh sounds reasonable to me?\nMR. SILVERBERG: I think the concern is,\nYour Honor, and it's hard to draw the line --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can he ignore the State\nlaw?\nMR. SILVERBERG: I think there's no\nadequate review if he chooses to without the court's\nreview of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that right? You don't\nthink a State court would in the blink of an eye set\naside an arbitration that allowed a -- a pound of flesh?\nMR. SILVERBERG: Your Honor, I would hope\nthey would, but I -- in reading the narrow review of\nsection 9, 10, and 11, I don't think we have that\nguarantee.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think you have a\nmisunderstanding of the law, then, if that's what you\nbelieve. I -- I think there's no doubt what would\nhappen in that case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is -- what I'm not sure\nabout what you are arguing now is my -- as I came into\nthis, I thought there were three situations. Situation\n1 is common in labor arbitration. It's an arbitration\nagreement that says wages, hours, and working conditions\ndisputes will be arbitrated, and we have a question\nabout whether a particular dispute is or is not full\nwithin the definition.\nMR. SILVERBERG: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: As to that one, we assume\nthat the parties intended the question of arbitrability\nto be arbitrated; we assume it. Normally, that's the\nrule. It's the scope of the arbitration agreement.\nThat's a little hard to distinguish, but sometimes\nthat's not the argument. The argument could be: Well,\nthere are four different provisions in the arbitration\nsection, and we think one of them is void because it's,\nsay, unconscionable, but the others are okay. Now, that\none, I mean, normally, you could if it's clear enough\nsay I want that one to go to arbitration.\nAnd the third one is that you have a\ncontract, and it's an arbitration contract, and it's on\nfour separate pieces of paper, and what you're saying\nis, I was in Alaska, or the equivalent, and maybe\nunconscionability is the equivalent. On that one I'm\nwith you.\nI don't see how you can submit -- agree to\nsubmit that to the arbitrator, because there's no\nagreement, or at least no valid one, at least no valid\none under State law.\nBut what are you arguing? That this is that\ncase or this is the other case I just mentioned, that\nmiddle case where you have 10 provisions and you're\nsaying that this one over here is unconscionable but\nthat one isn't; and -- but I did sign a valid\narbitration agreement. I agree with that. It's just that\ncertain provisions of it are invalid because they're\nunfair. What are you arguing in this case?\nMR. SILVERBERG: That -- Your Honor, it\nwould be the second one. That there are issues --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the second one -- I\ndon't see how you get there, because if it's the second,\none you concede that there is an arbitration agreement\nthat's valid. And if you concede that there is a valid\narbitration agreement between you and your client, and\nyou're arguing over the scope of different provisions\nor whether certain provisions within it are valid or\ninvalid, why can't you submit that to an arbitrator if\nit's clear enough?\nMR. SILVERBERG: But we don't concede that,\nYour Honor. That's the whole point, is that the court\nmust make that threshold determination.\nJUSTICE BREYER: As to each provision? As\nto each bit of -- why?\nMR. SILVERBERG: Because that's the mandate\nof section 2. The arbitrator derives his authority --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But suppose you and your --\nyour client -- rather, your client and the other side have\nabsolutely agreed, clear as could be, under the\narbitration agreement: We want arbitrated too whether\nthe provision that these words are contained in is\nunconscionable. Can't they agree to that?\nMR. SILVERBERG: Your Honor, the parties are\n-- don't necessarily have to take every issue to court,\nbut should a party challenge that issue as\nunconscionable, that door should remain open.\nThis case is not so much -- it is about our\ncase here, but there's a bigger picture here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Let me say it more\neasily. We have agreement number one, four pages, and\nwithin it is a question of -- which just looks like this\none. Agreement number two: The two parties agree that\nif any dispute should arise as to whether any words in\nagreement number one are unconscionable, they will go to\nthe arbitrator. Agreement number two is concededly\nvalid. Now do you want to say that agreement number\none -- those words have to be decided by the court?\nMR. SILVERBERG: Your Honor, it is our\nposition that -- that the threshold determination as to\nthe validity of the contract --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right, but if you're going\nto say yes --\nMR. SILVERBERG: -- would go the court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- then I think if you're going\nto say yes to that, then it's contrary to First Options, I think.\nI'm not sure, but I don't see why not.\nMR. SILVERBERG: Well, Your Honor, I think\nthat what Your Honor is describing is the first part of\nFirst Options that looked -- and that's what the\nPetitioner would like to rely on, is objective contract\nlanguage. But then the Court adds the entire other\nsection which says we don't presume that parties intend\nto arbitrate certain matters and -- because we're not\nyet at that scope -- but we want clear and unmistakable\nlanguage, not just objective language in the contract.\nAnd there's an important reason for that,\nbecause it's impossible to draw the line. You're\ncarving out certain issues of unconscionability --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: After this --\nMR. SILVERBERG: -- saying both --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: After this suit was filed\nand both parties are going up the steps to the court,\ncould the attorneys and the parties stop and say let's\narbitrate this issue of unconscionability and pick an\narbitrator? Could they do that?\nMR. SILVERBERG: They -- I think the answer\nthere would be yes, but the door needs to be open in\ncase there is a challenge, Your Honor. Certainly,\nnobody is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, then -- then the --\nMR. SILVERBERG: -- required to go to court.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then the employee loses.\nHe says: Oh, you have to have an open door; this was --\nthis was not properly before the arbitrator.\nMR. SILVERBERG: I think if Your Honor is\nasking --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because, you see, if\nyou say yes, that they can arbitrate this, then the\nquestion is why can't they do it when the contract's\nsigned?\nMR. SILVERBERG: Again, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume that the\nanswer to my question is yes, they can put that to an\narbitrator. If that's so, how can you prevail in this\ncase if the agreement clearly comprehends submission of\nthis issue to the arbitrator?\nMR. SILVERBERG: Well, we don't concede that\nit clearly does that. We -- what our position is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm -- I'm asking, assume\nyou do?\nMR. SILVERBERG: I don't think that gets us\naround the requirements of section 2, Your Honor, that\nsays the court and the doors to the court must always\nremain open for that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your --\nMR. SILVERBERG: I hope I'm understanding your\nquestion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Silverberg, the\nsection 2 on which you place much emphasis just says\nthat agreements are enforceable save on such grounds as\nexist in law or equity for revocation of a contract.\nBut the section 2 doesn't say any -- anything about who\ndecides that question.\nMR. SILVERBERG: That's true, Your Honor,\nthe -- but the logical reading of that statute would\nindicate that these three elements -- a writing, in\ninterstate commerce, and not revocable at law and\nequity -- would have to be met before the arbitrator has\nany authority to do anything.\nAnd as Your Honor mentioned in the -- in the\nDoctor's Associates case, there are certain issues that\nare certainly involved, and unconscionability is one of\nthose issues that can be presented to the court without\nviolating section 2, as well as fraud and duress, I\nbelieve, were the other ones that the Court had -- had\ndelineated in that case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I read your -- I promise\nyou I'll go back to First Options, which I thought was\nof gem-like clarity --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I am apparently the\nonly one in the world --\nMR. SILVERBERG: That's because it was well\nargued.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the only one in the\nworld who thinks that. And I'll go back to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You wrote that, didn't you?\nDidn't you write that opinion?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'll go back to that and\nlook at it. But the -- the --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Looking at your response to\ntheir motion to arbitrate --\nMR. SILVERBERG: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- it seemed to me you\nsaid here that -- that because of your -- your position,\nyour client's position, that the whole thing is\nunconscionable. You didn't say that?\nMR. SILVERBERG: Well, we said that -- it\nwas certainly my position that the entire agreement was\nunconscionable based on Nevada law --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. SILVERBERG: And that it was so\nincredibly one-sided, and also the limited discovery\nprovisions, and also because, frankly, we are not\nlooking to treat this anything other than like we would\nordinary contract law that also strikes one-sided\nprovisions in -- for example, in Nevada, the Fick case,\nwhich would strike down a one-sided prenuptial\nagreement, or lease agreements that have one-sided\nattorney fee provisions are routinely struck down as\none-sided. So their position --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But which is the stronger\ncase for arbitration? Case one, you attack the\narbitration clause only, part of the arbitration\ncontract only, as being unconscionable. Case two, you\nattack the whole agreement as being unconscionable. Do\nthose both stand on the same footing, or is one a\nstronger case for submission to the court than the\nother?\nMR. SILVERBERG: I think this Court has made\nclear in the severability cases that challenges to the\ncontract as a whole would go to the arbitrator to\ndecide. We have here, as Petitioner admits to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I find that somewhat\nparadoxical, but I -- I agree that that -- that that's\nthe law.\nMR. SILVERBERG: So the stronger one would\nbe an -- as this case, which we believe is very\nstrong, an attack --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So if you do go to the\nState court, suppose the State court says: I can't\nreally decide this question about the one clause unless\nI determine the conscionability or the unconscionability\nof the entire contract, and I now proceed to do that.\nDo you have to wait and say: Stop, you\ncan't do that?\nMR. SILVERBERG: I think that's what\nsections 3 and 4 contemplate, is for -- and they have\nbeen in existence since the passage of the Act -- for\nparties to come in and make their case as to whether or\nnot the FAA would apply or not apply.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose the State\ncourt judge says that he has to look at the whole\ncontract. Do you say: Oh, I'm sorry to bother you; we\nhave to go back to the arbitrator now?\nMR. SILVERBERG: That's not the situation in\nthis case, but assuming it were --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your -- no, it's a\nhypothetical case.\nMR. SILVERBERG: I understand.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What would your position\nbe in the hypothetical case, representing your client?\nMR. SILVERBERG: Representing my client, who\nis Mr. Jackson, I would want the court to look at the\nwhole thing, but if I were in the Petitioner's shoes I\nthink I would have an argument that, based on this\nCourt's precedent --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what do you think the\njudge should decide as between those two possibilities?\nMR. SILVERBERG: If it's an attack on the\ncontract as a whole, it should go to the arbitrator. I\nthink that's clear from many of the Court's cases;\nwhereas, if the attack is to the arbitration clause\nitself, that is something for the court to decide and\ndetermine.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I think I heard\nJustice Kennedy's question to be -- let's not confuse\nthe contract as a whole. There's only one contract\nhere.\nMR. SILVERBERG: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's an agreement to\narbitrate.\nMR. SILVERBERG: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So an attack on the --\nas I think Justice Breyer noted, you -- an argument that\nit's one-sided goes to the entire arbitration agreement.\nI don't want to arbitrate because that's not what I\nchose to do freely. Correct?\nMR. SILVERBERG: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That, you say, is for\nthe court.\nMR. SILVERBERG: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The difference here is\nthat there are provisions within how the arbitration is\ngoing to be held that, standing alone, you think are\nunconscionable, even though the agreement to arbitrate\nis not. Am I correct in understanding your allegation?\nMR. SILVERBERG: No, Your Honor.\nRespectfully, it's our position that both are present.\nThere are certain elements of the arbitration agreement\nthat are unconscionable and, under Nevada law, which\nwould render the entire arbitration agreement\nunconscionable.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You see, that's what I'm\nconfused by, because when I first asked you this\nquestion, you said: I would be happy to arbitrate if\nthe court struck the discovery provision and, I guess,\nthe fees provision. Which answer are you giving me?\nMR. SILVERBERG: I'm giving you the one I\njust gave you, I think, Your Honor, which is we've got\nboth certain provisions that are unconscionable, that\nunder Nevada law render the entire agreement\nunconscionable --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay. Let's assume --\nMR. SILVERBERG: -- and that's what the Court\nis to rely on.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay. That -- now I\nunderstand that part of your argument. But let's assume\nthat that wasn't Nevada law, that Nevada law would say\nseverability works, and there is an agreement to arbitrate,\nand all we have to or could do is strike the unfair provisions.\nLet's assume that situation. Who decides\nwhether to strike the unfair provisions?\nMR. SILVERBERG: That would be the court\nunder our position, Your Honor, and that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that can't be\nright. The -- how can you say there's no problem\nagreeing to arbitrate, no imbalance in bargaining\nauthority whatever, but then say, oh, but these\nprocedures are unconscionable?\nIt seems to me that the procedures are\nthere, and the party, the employee, whatever, can look\nat those. And if he says, well, that's unconscionable,\nyou don't sign the agreement as a whole. But once you\nare -- in for a penny, in for a pound. If you agree to\narbitrate, then it's at least for the arbitrator to\ndecide particular provisions, whether they're\nunconscionable.\nMR. SILVERBERG: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know you're\narguing in the alternative. But the one argument that\nwe get to pick out the provisions we don't like and say\nthose are unconscionable, but the agreement as a whole\nis not -- that seems to me illogical.\nMR. SILVERBERG: Your Honor, that is our\nposition. I hope I am understanding your question. But\nthis is a matter of State law as to which provisions\nwould render the entire agreement unconscionable. And I\nthink that body of unconscionability law is not so\nvaried that we would have unwieldy results. I think\nState --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's a matter\n-- it may be a matter of State law, but the open\nquestion is who gets to decide it.\nMR. SILVERBERG: Right, and our --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Arbitrators decide\nmatters of State law all the time.\nMR. SILVERBERG: Certainly, they do.\nCertainly, they do. But before they have that authority\nto even do that, the requirements, again, of section 2\nhave to be met. And that is our position in this\nmatter. That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's assume Nevada law\nsays you cannot -- you cannot fire somebody for coming\nin late to work any fewer than 10 times, all right?\nAnd an individual is fired. He goes to arbitration, or\nat least the company tries to take him to arbitration on\nit. And he says, no, because I was fired in violation\nof Nevada law.\nNow, is it your position that that -- that\nthat case would have to go immediately to court and\ncould not submit to the arbitrator the issue of whether\nindeed he was fired for coming less than 10 times, and\nindeed whether if he was coming in less than 10 times,\nthat would be an invalid basis for a dismissal?\nMR. SILVERBERG: No, Your Honor, and here's\nwhy: I think Your Honor has described a situation\nsimilar to -- I believe that was the Green Tree\nsituation, where there was an allegation that the entire\ncontract was illegal, the usurious contract. But there\nwas no question as to the making of the agreement to\narbitrate.\nSo, in Your Honor's hypothetical, if there is\nno dispute as to the arbitration agreement being subject\nto a ground of revocation at law or at equity as\ndefined in section 2, then I would -- I would concede\nthat that was something that would go to the arbitrator,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, your -- your position\nseems to be that unconscionability is the same as\ncoercion in the making of the agreement. And I don't\nknow that that's true.\nMR. SILVERBERG: Well, Your Honor,\nrespectfully, in Doctor's Associates, I think the Court\nspoke very clearly that fraud, duress, and\nunconscionability are there and are part of something\nthat can be raised under section 2. And also the\nCourt's hold in Prima Paint --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I don't care what we --\nMR. SILVERBERG: -- where fraud --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care what we said in\ndictum. It doesn't seem to me that unconscionability is\nthe same as duress or the same as fraud --\nMR. SILVERBERG: To -- oh, I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that you can -- you can\nbe a stupid person who voluntarily signs an unconscionable\ncontract. Now, the courts may protect you because you're\nstupid, but you haven't been coerced. Is there no\ndistinction between unconscionability and coercion?\nMR. SILVERBERG: Not under section 2, Your\nHonor. I think the -- the definition that the\nPetitioner would have this Court adopt, that narrow view\nof making -- again, something Justice Sotomayor\nbrought up -- would create a rule where certain\nunconscionability challenges went to the court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that?\nMR. SILVERBERG: -- and other\nunconscionability challenges didn't go to the court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that? I would say\nall unconscionability challenges, if you have an agreement\nthat's as clear as this one, would go to the arbitrator.\nWhich ones would have to go to the court?\nMR. SILVERBERG: All of them should go to\nthe court, Your Honor, based on this Court's holding\nboth in Doctor's Associates and Prima Paint, in that\nboth fraud in the inducement, like in Prima Paint, and\nunconscionability envision a situation where you've\ngot a formed contract that people can choose to opt out\nof. I may be subject to a contract that was induced by\nfraud, but I may like the benefit of that bargain. So I\nmay be able to go ahead with that.\nAnd same with an unconscionability challenge.\nWe've got an agreement that was made that -- that the\ninnocent party can decide to opt out of. And I think\nthat's very consistent with this Court's holding and\nwith what the various State courts have been doing in\nreliance on those holdings.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But not every contract. I\nmean, I'll take that argument. I'd like to know\nabout that argument. I'd like to know what really\nis the underlying, which I've never looked up.\nWhat is the underlying rationale in contract\nlaw of setting aside contracts as unconscionable? Why\ndo courts do it? What's the theory? I'd like to\nknow that.\nMR. SILVERBERG: My understanding is that\nit's so unfair that it couldn't really be said that a\nparty assented to -- to that. And I think that's what --\nJUSTICE BREYER: See, that's what I wonder,\nthat last part -- is it that the basic theory is we want to\nprotect a group of people by -- who voluntarily entered\ninto contracts by giving them the right to opt out, or is\nis that we don't think that they really meant to do it?\nMR. SILVERBERG: It's the latter, Your\nHonor. I think if they really chose to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. On that\nquestion, or any other question, is, I would imagine,\nwhere we have agreement one, and the argument is maybe\nagreement one was unconscionable. And then we enter\ninto agreement two, and the parties in agreement two\nagree to -- to arbitrate their unconscionability dispute\nin agreement one, and there's nothing wrong with\nagreement two, I would think that's then the question of\nunconscionability is for the arbitrator.\nMR. SILVERBERG: If I understand your\nquestion --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You said \"all,\" and I just\ndon't think you meant all. But maybe you did. That's\nwhy I asked the question.\nMR. SILVERBERG: I -- I think that the safe\nthing to do is to keep the door open to people,\nespecially in situations like this, where there is such\nunequal bargaining power, where people are presented\nwith a nonnegotiable term of their employment --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this kind of\nelementary question?\nMR. SILVERBERG: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are there cases out there\nthat hold that an agreement can be partially\nunconscionable, that it's unconscionable for some\nclauses but not in its -- in its entirety?\nMR. SILVERBERG: Certainly. And I think\nthat would be matter of State law, again, to determine\nwhen there --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But there are cases\nthat -- that draw that distinction?\nMR. SILVERBERG: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There are cases drawing\nthat very elementary distinction?\nMR. SILVERBERG: I believe so, Your Honor.\nI think in Nevada you would -- if we had maybe just one\nunconscionable clause, that the court might sever and\nsend the rest to the -- and validate the rest of the\narbitration agreement. But then when -- certain -- any\nnumber of clauses, depending on State law, would make\nthe entire agreement to arbitrate unconscionable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it make a\ndifference in response to Justice Stevens's hypothetical\nthat there is a provision saying the arbitrator will\ndecide the conscionability of all clauses? The\narbitrator may decide that clauses 2 and 8 are\nunconscionable, but if there's an agreement and it's\nnot unconscionable that the arbitrator will decide, then\nthe arbitrator decides all of them, right?\nMR. SILVERBERG: If the agreement -- I think\nI understand your question. If the agreement to\narbitrate itself is not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. SILVERBERG: -- there's no\nunconscionability challenge to that, and there's no\nother fraud in the inducement or any other thing that\nthe court has mentioned it would go to the broader view\nof making the grounds for revocation, if those grounds\nfor revocation are not present, then I believe the\narbitrator would be empowered to make those decisions,\nYour Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask you just a\nfollow-up on Justice Breyer's hypothetical to you where\nhe had the first agreement and then the issue to the\nsecond? You said you've got to leave the door open.\nThe door open on the second agreement or on the first\nagreement?\nMR. SILVERBERG: I think the door should be\nopen on all the agreements, because until that door is\nopen under section 2 -- as long as that door is open\nunder section 2, then we don't have the concern about\nparties making the terms of arbitration so onerous or\nburdensome that they would not be able to even access the\narbitral forum. And that's really a huge concern in --\nin not just in this case, but in the bigger picture.\nCourts must remain open to protect people.\nI would venture to say that there are many\npeople in this room who are subject to arbitration\nagreements, and they don't even know, through --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Silverberg --\nMR. SILVERBERG: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBERG: -- on that, underlying\nyour whole case I think is the notion that this is an\nadhesion contract; it's a take-it-or-leave-it contract,\nvery common in consumer, credit card agreements, in\nemployment contracts, that one party has no say except\nto sign or not to sign. Are all those contracts subject\nto the unconscionability argument that you're making or\nonly some of them? And if only some, which ones?\nMR. SILVERBERG: I would suggest, Your\nHonor, that they all are subject to that. And then we\nlook to State law to determine, whether, for example, in\nNevada if you've great procedural unconscionability\nthey have the sliding scale approach based on the D.R.\nHorton case, which we have briefed, where you would\nrequire less of a showing of substantive\nunconscionability.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not much use signing an\narbitration agreement then, not much use for the employer.\nHe's going to end up in court anyway. Every one of them\nwill be acknowledge as unconscionable. So what's the\nuse?\nMR. SILVERBERG: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, kiss good-bye to\narbitration.\nMR. SILVERBERG: Not at all, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No?\nMR. SILVERBERG: That door's been open under\nsection 3 and 4 since the inception of the Act. We are\nadvocating the status quo be maintained here, Your Honor,\nand there is no reason to suggest that there will be some\nrush to court on this. Courts are quite capable to do this\nin a summary fashion.\nIf a party comes before the court with a\nbaseless unconscionability challenge, I would imagine\nnot only will the court dispose of it quickly, but if an\nattorney makes a routine practice of bringing baseless\nmotions to the court, he'll have his own issues to\ndeal with. So, I don't -- I -- I disagree that there\nwill be some floodgates or that this will in any way --\nto the contrary --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The amici certainly claim\nthe contrary. The Chamber of Commerce claims that this\nis what's happening and that it has been a snowballing\neffect.\nMR. SILVERBERG: We disagree with them and\nYour Honor, and I would cite that we have some of the\nmost prestigious arbitrators in this country that have\njoined our position and recognized the courts' vital role\nin maintaining the fairness of the arbitration process\nso the public can trust it and so the weaker parties to\nthese agreements can be protected, because should that\ndisappear, there will be nothing to stop stronger\nparties from again sending Mr. Jackson, who lives in\nReno, to Minnesota to arbitrate his claim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This clause is not of that\nkind, and you've singled out three things that made it\nunconscionable. One, the fee provision, the splitting\nfees, that the court rejected. So the only two left is\nthe one-sided aspect of it and the limited discovery.\nIt seemed to me that the limited discovery\nclause, that that was quite common to say we're not --\nwe don't want to get involved in the massive discovery\nyou can get in a -- in a civil proceeding. Is there\nsomething unusual about limiting discovery to documents?\nMR. SILVERBERG: There -- there is something\nunusual. They've gone well beyond the AAA and limited\ndiscovery to one deposition and one expert, which in an\nemployment case is very difficult.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Friedman, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT T. FRIEDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI'm hearing terms like \"safe thing to do.\"\nAnd in response to -- I think it was a question from\nJustice Scalia, I'm hearing my colleague state that\nthere is concern that the arbitrator is not going to\napply State law.\nThis is merely distrust of arbitrators.\nThis Court has rejected this bias that arbitrators cannot\nmake these decisions. And, in fact, this Court and many\nothers have sent very, very complicated issues to the\narbitrator to decide. There is no reason to believe that\nan arbitrator, as well as a judge, cannot decide State\nlaw issues of unconscionability, and the arbitrator will\nhave the discretion and the ability to either strike the\nentire arbitration agreement or strike certain clauses\nas he or she sees fit.\nFurthermore, this type of speculation, this\nfear as to what the arbitrator may do, that was rejected\nin this Court's decisions in Vimar and PacifiCare, where\nthe Court stated we are going to enforce this, and the\narbitrator may do something wrong, may do something\nright, but at the tail end there will be an ability\nunder section 10 to address it. There is no difference\nthere.\nAdditionally, this -- this analysis of\nunconscionability -- I want to reiterate\nunconscionability is based on a policy decision that --\nthat attacks an agreement that unquestionably has\nalready been made.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. What is the\none-sentence answer, one sentence, to the thing, this is\na very interesting case, lots of stuff in it that we\nneedn't reach because irrespective of everything else,\nthey in their reply, the district court, and the court\nof appeals all said these whole four pages, the whole\nfour pages were unconscionable, so none of it's\nenforceable, and all we have to decide is whether that's\nan issue for the court. And the answer to that\nbeing not an issue for the court is what, in a sentence or\ntwo?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Justice Breyer, I'm sorry.\nI'm going to ask you to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They said, look, there's a\nfour-page document. They said this four-page document\nis unconscionable, the product of unconscionability, and,\ntherefore, don't enforce it. That's their claim. That\nissue is at least is for the court, because there is no\nvalid agreement here at all, if that's right.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: No, Justice Breyer, the\ndetermination of unconscionability is for the\narbitrator. The -- the limited role of the court goes\nonly to the making, not to the issue of\nunconscionability. So the court --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem -- I -- I\nkeep going back to my initial question to you, is you\nwant to parse out what making is from unconscionability,\nand you want us to say, well, if it's too onerous a fee\nfor arbitration, that goes to the making, because you're\ndepriving the party of -- of an arbitration forum.\nIf it's discovery, that doesn't go to depriving them\nof anything because the arbitrator could give them more\ndiscovery if he or she chose. Am I correct, this is\nyour argument?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: No, Justice Sotomayor, our\nargument about the onerous fee -- and it would have to\nbe evidence put in by the party opposing counsel -- by\nthe party opposing arbitration, that there was an actual\nbarrier, an impossibly burdensome barrier. So it does not\ncome under making; it would be under a -- a Randolph\nstandard or under a First Options standard.\nThere's two areas that we agree are for the\ncourt. One is to determine whether or not there's an\nissue with the making of the agreement. The other one,\nif it's challenged, is to determine whether or not there\nis indeed access to arbitration.\nThe First Circuit in Awuah applied this test\nvery neatly in a very reasonable manner and applied both\nFirst Options and Randolph, harmonized those cases, and\nmade a determination that unconscionability is for the\narbitrator based on a clear and unmistakable delegation.\nBut issues as to whether or not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If there's no access to\narbitration, there's no way that you can leave that\nissue to the arbitrator, is there?\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Exactly, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because you never get to\nthe arbitrator.\nMR. FRIEDMAN: Exactly, Justice Scalia. It\nfails the First Options test. There can't be an ability\nunder First Options for the arbitrator to make a\ndecision if there's no access to the arbitrator. So\nthose are the two tests. In -- in this case, what I\nthink I'm hearing is my colleague is saying that the\narbitrator can decide nothing; the arbitrator should\ndecide nothing, notwithstanding this Court's regular\nholdings sending very, very complicated matters to the\narbitrator. In this case, the arbitrator can absolutely\ndecide these issues of unconscionability as well as a\njudge can.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Friedman, Mr. Silverberg.\n"
