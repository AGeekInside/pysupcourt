        "content": "(12:59 p.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument next in Case 08-728, Bloate v. United States.\nMr. Stancil.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK K. STANCIL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. STANCIL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPretrial motion preparation time is not\nautomatically excluded under Section 3161(h)(1) of the\nSpeedy Trial Act. Such delays are subject to exclusion\nonly on a case-by-case basis under (h)(7).\nI would like to focus today on three\nfeatures of the statutory text that make that abundantly\nclear. First and foremost, when crafting (h)(1)\nCongress specifically addressed pretrial motion delays\nand precisely defined that exclusion. Subparagraph (D)\ndeclares that the exclusion shall begin with the filing\nof the motion and end with the hearing on or other\nprompt disposition of the motion.\nReading the general language in (h)(1) to\nencompass preparation time would circumvent the\ndeliberate legislative choice to limit the pretrial\nmotion exclusion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That would allow the\nprosecutor's time to be excluded, right? On your theory\nthat it starts -- the trigger is the filing of the\nmotion, and it ends when the motion is disposed of. So\nthe prosecutor might say, I need additional time, and\nthat would be included in the suspension period, right?\nMR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor. The\ngovernment's motions and the defense motions are treated\nequally under (h)(1), which is why the government's rule\nto treat defense motions, or defense requests for\nadditional time differently --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I'm --\nMR. STANCIL: The exclusion -- I'm sorry,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. STANCIL: The exclusion begins with the\nfiling of the motion, be it the defense motion or the\ngovernment's motion. That is clear on the text, the\nface of the text of the statute, which --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the clock -- the\nclock would run, on your theory, during the preparation\ntime of the defendant. It would not run during the\npreparation time of the prosecutor. So I don't think\nthey are being treated the same.\nMR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor, that is not\nour position. The clock runs up until the moment of\nfiling.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.\nMR. STANCIL: Whether it is a defense motion\nor a government motion. So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, no. I'm talking\nabout the prosecutor's answer to the defense motion.\nMR. STANCIL: Oh, yes, Your Honor. Their\nresponse to the motion, it is tolled -- or the clock\nstops during the preparation of the response by either\nside. And that was a deliberate legislative choice by\nCongress. It says -- on the face of (h)(1), it says the\nclock stops at filing and remains stopped through the\nconclusion of the hearing or other prompt disposition of\nthe motion.\nThat was an express choice by Congress. It\nwas not lost on them that a response time would be\ntreated differently. And the government's suggestion\nthat that, therefore, means we should factor back in\npreparation time is --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Shouldn't we be\nlooking --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One point that I would\nlike you to clarify. I -- I understand you to take the\nposition that the interest of justice would be the route\nto take, where the judge would have to stop and make a\nfinding. In your view, would it be appropriate,\nassuming your interpretation of (B)(i) holds, for us to\nsend the case back, or is it too late, because the\ninterest of justice finding was never made?\nMR. STANCIL: It is too late because this\nCourt answered that question -- that very question in\nZedner and held that an (h)(7) ends of justice finding\ncannot be supplied retrospectively on remand. That was\nthe precise question put to this Court and it was\nrejected by the Court unanimously.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you think it could be\nfound. If it doesn't have to be found on the spot by\nthe judge, when is the latest time the judge could make\nthe interest of justice filing?\nMR. STANCIL: Zedner says that as long as it\nis made -- or the latest it could be made is the time by\nwhich the district court rules on the motion to dismiss\non speedy trial -- on speedy trial grounds. So it can\nbe made in the district court up until the time the\ndistrict court decides the speedy trial motion. It does\nnot -- at least it is left open in Zedner.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So the result in your\ncase would be that the case is dismissed, period.\nMR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor. It would be\n-- it would be remanded with instructions to dismiss.\nHowever, the district court -- it remains for the\ndistrict court to determine whether to dismiss with or\nwithout prejudice according to the factors specified in\nthe act.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is it clear that a period of\ntime attributable to a defense request for time to\nprepare pretrial motions can fall within (h)(7)?\nBecause (h)(7) speaks of a continuance. Isn't that a\nvery -- wouldn't that be a very odd use of the word\n\"continuance\"?\nIf you make an application to a judge for\ntime, additional time to prepare pretrial motions, do\nyou say, \"I want a continuance of the date on which my\npretrial motions are due\"?\nMR. STANCIL: I think that's not an unusual\nreading of the term \"continuance,\" yes, Your Honor. I\nthink they frequently -- trial counsel will frequently\nask for a continuance of the date. But what I think\nboth parties agree is that that is how the courts almost\nuniversally interpret (h)(7), that any time that is\nexcluded, even if it doesn't result in the moving of the\ntrial date per se, is treated as an (h)(7) exclusion.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, there's -- but the\ncourts of appeals have almost universally read\n(h)(1)(D), or overwhelmingly read (h)(1)(D) to apply in\nthis situation as well.\nI'm sorry. Not (h)(1)(D), but the\nintroductory phrase.\nMR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor, but this rule\nwasn't confined to pretrial motions. So even in those\njurisdictions that follow the majority position at issue\nhere, also to my understanding use (h)(7) to exclude\nintermediate delays before trial. In fact, in the\ngovernment's brief, the government acknowledges that\ncourts treat pretrial motion delays under either (h)(1)\nor (h)(7), and more specifically (h)7)(B)(iv), which\nspecifically speaks in terms of preparation. And in\nfact, that's still further evidence that Congress\nspecifically contemplated that preparation time would go\nunder (h)(7). Both (h)(7)(B)(ii) and (h)(7)(B)(iv)\nspecifically direct district courts to consider the need\nfor additional time for adequate or effective\npreparation.\nAnd Justice Alito, back to your concern\nspecifically with motions. (B)(ii) specifically refers\nto pretrial proceedings. So I think there, in that\nsense, there is evidence that Congress didn't think that\na continuance under (h)(7) would refer only to a\ncontinuance of the trial date. At least, that's --\nthat's my understanding.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, at the time\nthat (h)(1)(C) -- or (D) was being looked at, wasn't it\na fact that some circuits had reviewed the prior\nexclusion as applying only to the date in which there\nwere actual hearings before the court?\nMR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So isn't it -- shouldn't\nwe be looking at what you did with respect to this time\nperiod in light of the need that it was addressing?\nMR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor. And the\nCourt -- and Congress did decide to expand or clarify\nthe end point and beginning point of the (h)(1)(D)\nexclusion.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, what's wrong with\nthe logic of district courts who have ruled in this --\nin the government's favor, that say Congress was only\nlooking at that particular part of the proceeding --\nwhat related to the hearing, the filing of the motion,\nits actual adjudication -- but they weren't considering\na motion by the defendant for time to investigate, and\nthat can be another proceeding?\nCan you imagine a situation in which a court\ngrants that adjournment to a defense attorney where we\nwould reverse that finding by the court?\nMR. STANCIL: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nReverse --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- it would seem to\nme that if a defense attorney comes to a court and says,\nI need an adjournment, and the Court says, you can have\nit, isn't that implicitly a proceeding in which the\ncourt is saying there is a need for this?\nMR. STANCIL: Not in a speedy trial context,\nYour Honor, for two reasons. First, it is not a\nproceeding. There is no pretrial proceeding until the\nmotion is filed. That is -- that is the definition of a\npretrial motion proceeding. It is a formal initiation\nbefore the district court.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: \"Proceeding\" doesn't\nmean an act -- it is an act before the court. The\nentire action is before the court. But it is a\nproceeding in which the defense attorney is looking at\nwhether there's anything to file motions about.\nMR. STANCIL: If that were correct, Your\nHonor, then preparing your witnesses is a proceeding\nrespecting trial. I think that takes \"proceeding\" and\nexpands it so that everything would be excludable delay.\nBut if -- if I may return to your original\nquestion, Congress did look at preparation time when\ndrafting (h)(1) and (h)(1)B) specifically --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, the Senate did.\nMR. STANCIL: Pardon me. Yes, the Senate\nJudiciary Committee specifically considered a proposal\nby the government no less to include preparation time,\nand the committee rejected that proposal as\nunreasonable. I think this is simply not a case in\nwhich we are left to guess whether preparation time was\non the table. It was on the table and it was declared\nunreasonable to suggest that it would be within the\nautomatic exclusion.\nMoreover, I think that makes abundant sense.\nIt is not the case that simply asking for more time\nnecessarily means that you have some prejudice in the\nspeedy trial context, or even that the trial date\nnecessarily would move. In this case, the counsel\nrequested the extension for pretrial motions. That\nextension was granted. The trial date held. It wasn't\nmoved until much later, under an (h)(7) exclusion on\nunrelated grounds. So I think it's a -- I think it's a\nfalse -- a red herring, if you will, for the government\nto suggest that when the defendant asks for something,\nit's necessarily -- it ought to be granted, fair enough,\nbut that it's necessarily going to prejudice the speedy\ntrial calculation.\nWith respect, I don't think that's the case.\nI think ordinarily, these things will come very early in\nthe speedy trial -- speedy trial clock, and there will\nbe relatively brief delays. And so I think it's quite\nreasonable to think that district courts could be\nallowed to give more flexible preparation time to decide\nwhether to file, what to file, and then the exclusion\nstarts with the filing. And I think Congress has made\nthat abundantly clear in -- on the text of the statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That would certainly\nencourage judges who don't want to get involved with\nmaking findings, which you have to do to satisfy\ninterest of justice, to just say: Motion denied; I'm\nsorry, I'm not going to let you have the clock run while\nyou -- you are asking me for a favor. You want time to\nprepare, and the clock is going to run in the meantime.\nForget it. You are not going to get the extension.\nMR. STANCIL: I disagree, Your Honor.\nFirst, I think courts will granted them when\nnecessary. Again because it is early in the clock,\nthere won't necessarily be speedy trial -- some sort of\nspeedy prejudice to the government. But moreover, all\nthis means is that the court needs to put findings on\nthe record to say this is preparation time that is\nlegitimately needed, the defendant's interests here\noutweigh the public's interest, and so I'm going to\ngrant that and I'm going to put those findings on the\nrecord. And I think it's clear from the statute that\nthat's how Congress anticipated this would work. But\nI --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What must the judge --\nthe judge must make a finding orally or in writing. Can\nit just say, okay, I'm giving it to you in the interest\nof justice?\nMR. STANCIL: I think -- I don't believe\nthat precise question has come to the Court. But courts\nare very permissive in terms of how much needs to be put\non the record, and it's my understanding that this\nhappens quite literally every day in scores of contexts\nwhere courts, as long as they make the finding, it is\nreviewed for an abuse of discretion only and that's\nsufficient.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So the rule that you are\narguing for really will accomplish nothing, other than\nto benefit a small set of defendants who -- who got\npretrial preparation time in reliance on court of\nappeals decisions saying that those could be done\nwithout making explicit ends of justice findings on the\nrecord?\nMR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. If we are\ncorrect, the decision will have significant effect on\nthe public's interest. In fact, an individual defendant\nhas very little to gain from such gamesmanship as the\ngovernment suggests would be at issue. What you get is\na dismissal of your indictment with or without\nprejudice, and there are no statute of limitations\nproblems --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, how is the public\ngoing to benefit if all the judge needs -- presumably,\ndistrict judges are not granting these extensions of\ntime in situations in which they do not think that the\nends of justice are served by granting the extension of\ntime.\nSo what is going to be served by requiring\nthem to recite this -- to make this rote recitation on\nthe record?\nMR. STANCIL: First, Your Honor, it's not\nrote. It specifies four factors that they have to\nconsider, including and before, it says, whether its\ntime -- the time is necessary for effective preparation,\ntaking into account the exercise of due diligence.\nWhat this -- what putting this under (h)(7)\nand making that process required will do is weed out the\nvery worst sorts of delays where counsel, even for the\ndefendant or the government, comes in and asks for the\ndelay without the exercise of due diligence and without\nany showing that this is actually necessary. And I\nthink that's exactly what Congress was doing by not\nputting this under the automatic exclusion in (h)(1).\nIf it's automatically excluded, and there is\nadditional time granted for no reason whatsoever or for\nsomething that wouldn't meet the due diligence standard\nin (B)(iv), the speedy trial clock is effectively\nlengthened automatically.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you tell me how it\nworks in district courts? This district court set\nSeptember 13 originally for the -- for the motion. Do\nthe district courts generally have a custom schedule for\nevery case where they set times or do they have local\nrules on the subject?\nMR. STANCIL: With respect to pretrial\nmotions specifically?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. STANCIL: It varies widely from district\nto district. For example, in some districts the default\nis 21 days. So, if you try a case in Chicago, you go to\narraignment, your pretrial motions, unless set by a\ndifferent rule, are due in 21 --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's -- that's part\nof -- that there in the local rule of court?\nMR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor. In D.C., it\nis 11 days. In many other jurisdictions and here, there\nis no set time limit.\nAnd one of the problems -- one of the\nfundamental problems with the government's rule that a\nrequest -- a defense request for additional time must be\ntreated differently and does stop the clock, is that\ngives speedy trial consequences to those variations in\nlocal rules. So, in districts where you have a very\nshort standard timeframe, the defendant has to run in,\nif he wants to file pretrial motions, and stop the clock\nalmost automatically. If you have -- say, your motions\nare due automatically in seven days; you have got to run\nin there and stop the clock.\nAs a practical matter, the speedy trial, the\n70 days, it's that much longer in those districts\nbecause you have got to stop the clock compared to\ndistricts where, say, 21 days are ordinarily allotted.\nWell, they may not have to stop the clock. It's clear\nthat Congress did not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm -- I'm not sure\nthat that isn't -- that that argument doesn't cut both\nways.\nMR. STANCIL: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure if that -- if\nyou have a district where you have five days, a very\nshort period and almost nobody can comply with it, then\nmaybe that's an argument for the government's rule.\nMR. STANCIL: I disagree, Your Honor. I\nthink that illustrates the problem, because if there is\na -- call it an unreasonably short time period in this\ndistrict, the speedy trial clock only burns for four or\nfive days or a week, and then someone is going to have\nto run in and stop it. So those trials are just going\nto take longer.\nLet's assume that it takes two weeks on\naverage or three weeks on average to prepare a\nreasonable pretrial motion. Well, in those\njurisdictions that have that local rule, the short local\nrule, you get two extra weeks on the speedy trial clock,\nbecause you have to run in and hit stop on the clock by\nasking for additional time.\nIn those districts that give you 21 days by\ndefault, by contrast, that whole 21 days counts against\nthe 70 days. And that is, I think -- I think that is an\nessential judgment that Congress made. It decided on 70\ndays --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think an\nassumption in your mathematical analysis is that there\nwill be a difference in the time that it takes to\ndispose of the motion. If the time to dispose of the\nmotion is the same, then you are wrong, I think. I will\nwork it out.\nMR. STANCIL: I don't believe so, Your\nHonor. If you assume hypothetically 21 days to prepare\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.\nMR. STANCIL: -- 21 days to respond and call\nit 21 days to rule --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.\nMR. STANCIL: -- in a district that allows\n21 days of preparation time by default rule, 21 days\nwill burn and then 42 days with response and ruling.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.\nMR. STANCIL: In a district that allows only\nfive days, five days burn, and then you have to stop the\nclock for the additional 16 days of preparation, plus\n21, plus 21. You end up effectively, if the difference\nis 5 days or 21 days, there is an 86-day speedy trial\nclock in the district with the short rule and a 70-day\nspeedy trial clock in the district with the local\nrule -- with the 21-day rule.\nAnd so I think it's -- and it's clear that\nwhat Congress did not want in the Speedy Trial Act was\nthese time periods to be amended by local rule\neffectively. And that's what would happen. I think\nmore fundamentally --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where does that show,\nbecause the disposition time isn't going to be the same\nfrom district to district? Districts vary.\nMR. STANCIL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Congress could have\nrequired, as they have in some instances, to have a\njudge decide a matter within a certain period of time.\nThey didn't do that, did they?\nMR. STANCIL: That's not correct, Your\nHonor. In subparagraph (H), 3161(h)(1)(H) allows only\n30 days during which a matter is actively under --\nactually under advisement by the district court. So\nhere they actual did set a 30-day clock on which to\nrule.\nThere is an exception to that. If there is\na hearing subparagraph (D) says, well, you know, we are\nnot going to govern the time in the hearing, and this\nCourt's in Henderson gives district courts flexibility\nin that regard, when there is a hearing. But Congress\nwas pretty clear in trying to put a book end at either\nend. It starts on filing and it ends with disposition,\nand we only give you 30 days without a hearing or after\nthe hearing to dispose of it.\nAnd I think more fundamentally this is a\nquintessentially legislative judgment. Congress said,\nthis is a system of rules that we need in place to move\ncases more expeditiously toward trial. We are going to\ngive you 70 days. We are going to exclude certain\nthings automatically, and we are going to give district\ncourts flexibility under (h)(7).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could a district\njudge, as part of his normal pretrial order, say that I\nam inclined to grant normal motions for extensions, but\nI think so we don't run into these problems that it's in\nthe best interest of justice that whatever time I grant,\nI issue an order covered by (h)(7)(A)? That avoids all\nthis problem. I don't have to worry about the Speedy\nTrial Act when I grant you a motion, because whatever I\ngrant you is going to be excluded under (h)(7)(A).\nMR. STANCIL: I don't -- that sounds a lot\nlike a prospective waiver of speedy trial, which is --\nthis court rejected in Zedner. If I understand the\nhypothetical correctly, if the district court says if I\ngive you extra time, we are not going to complain about\nit later. I don't think that the court could do that,\nand I don't think that would be consistent --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But presumably, a\njudge can do it in every case. You are saying they\ncan't tell you in advance this is what they are going to\ndo, but they can do it automatically in every case?\nMR. STANCIL: I don't believe so, Your\nHonor. I think, if I understand the hypothetical\ncorrectly, if a -- if we appear before the district\njudge and the judge says exclusions or extensions for\npretrial motions will qualify for (h)(7), that sounds\nlike to me in an individual case a prospective waiver of\nthat defendant's Speedy Trial Act --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wait a minute. If a\ndefense attorney comes in to you and says -- I'm a\ndistrict court judge -- I need time to prepare; granted,\nI am excluding time under (7)(A). You are saying that\nis insufficient?\nMR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. If it's done\non a case-by-case basis, where the time is requested and\nthe continuance or the delay is granted with the (h)(7)\nfindings made either then or later, that would be\nperfectly appropriate. That's how Congress --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's not okay for a\ndistrict court to say, you tell me how much or you have\n21 days to prepare motions and I'm excluding time\nbecause of that?\nMR. STANCIL: No. I'm not sure I -- I\napologize. I'm not sure I under --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Local rule from a\ndistrict court judge: Defendant is arraigned; you have\n21 days to file motions.\nMR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor. That is --\nthat time is not excluded if it is just set by local\nrule.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you finish\nanswering one earlier question. You said that there is\nno statute of limitations problems if we rule in your\nfavor. Could you explain why?\nMR. STANCIL: Yes. Under 18 U.S.C., I\nbelieve it's 3288 and 3289, essentially gives the\ngovernment six months after the dismissal of an\nindictment to reindict a defendant. And courts have\nalmost universally held that that applies -- or I\nbelieve it's universally held that that applies where\nthe dismissal is based on Speedy Trial Act grounds. I\nthink we are in agreement with the government that there\nis not a statute of limitations problem.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could under that retrial\nprovision the court begin excluding time?\nMR. STANCIL: The speedy trial clock starts\nanew after a new --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what I mean.\nMR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor. That is\nclear under the statute.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have any idea how\nmany convictions would be at risk for reversal under\nthis rule, that would be currently pending and subject\nto a ruling in your favor now?\nMR. STANCIL: I don't know. My supposition\nis that it's not very many. The government certainly\nhasn't suggested that there are a lot. It would have to\nbe cases within those eight districts or -- pardon me --\nI guess it would be nine or ten, that have either not\ntaken a position or take the government's position, in\nwhich the defendant raised this argument in the trial\ncourt --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In a timely manner.\nMR. STANCIL: -- in a timely manner. So I\nthink if that is the case, it's an exceedingly small\nnumber, and for that matter, that would be a problem in\nany case in which this Court reverses an incorrect\nruling.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is -- is there any\nindication in the circuits that follow what seems to be\nthe majority rule -- that is that the clock is stopped\nduring preparation time -- that there have been\nexcessive delays, in comparison to the -- what is it,\ntwo circuits who go the other way?\nMR. STANCIL: Not that I am aware of, Your\nHonor, but nor has there been any indication that\ndistrict courts in the two jurisdiction where they get\nthe rule right in our view deny defense requests for\nadditional time.\nI think -- I think this rule will matter if\nyou assume that the average pretrial motion extension is\nrelatively modest and that the lawyers are fairly\nreasonable in what they request. We are talking about,\nyou know, additional delays of a week or two weeks, but\nthat is -- again, that backs right up into the\ncongressional judgment, the legislative judgment that\nCongress made.\nAnd so those trials will on average in the\nmajority of jurisdictions, I think, just take that much\nlonger to get to trial.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what is your\nsystemic concern with the -- with the government's rule?\nThe judge has to grant the continuance under either --\nunder either of your rules, and you say he has to make a\nfinding that it's good. But are you concerned the\ncontinuance would be because the attorney wants to play\ngolf or take a vacation with his kids, and that that's\nnot the cause?\nMR. STANCIL: Well, that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that's what's driving\nyour concern?\nMR. STANCIL: Well, that would be -- that is\nthe most important function of (h)(7), to screen out the\ntruly unmeritorious delays. That's what Congress wanted\nto get at most of all.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But wouldn't judges in\nmany cases do that anyway just in the course of deciding\nwhether to grant a continuance?\nMR. STANCIL: The court may --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Give -- give me the\nconsequences of ruling for the government that you see\nthat are adverse in your view.\nMR. STANCIL: The consequence -- ruling for\nthe government would mean that any time a defendant\nneeds any extra time, or -- or we would say either side\nneeds any extra time, the clock stops. And so any time\nyou need additional time for pretrial motions there is\nno balancing.\nSo in the routine case that is not complex,\nwhere the -- where the defendant's counsel may be just\nsimply not exercising due diligence, you could ask for\ntwo weeks and there is no -- there is no balancing. The\ndistrict court doesn't even have to ask, what's the\ndelay, you know, why the extra delay? And that time is\nautomatically excluded.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's my point.\nMR. STANCIL: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I assume the district\njudge will ask. Or is --\nMR. STANCIL: In the absence --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or do you doubt that?\nMR. STANCIL: I am sure it will vary from\ncourt to court. But in the absence of (h)(7) and\nputting it on the record, the district court is\ncertainly not required to ask and may not -- certainly\nwon't put those findings on the record. And I think\nthis Court made that point very clear in Zedner, that\n(h)(7) balances substantive open-endedness with\nprocedural strictness, and the procedure is what\nmatters, and Congress made that explicitly clear in\ndrafting (h)(7).\nIf I may, I would like to reserve the\nremainder of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Roberts.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAdditional time granted for preparation of\npretrial motions is automatically excluded from the\nSpeedy Trial Act deadline for commencing trial. For\nthree reasons, that time falls under section 3161(h)(1)\nwhich excludes delay resulting from other proceedings\nconcerning the defendant.\nFirst, Section (h)(1) excludes delay\nresulting from various listed proceedings and other\nproceedings that are analogous or ancillary to those\nproceedings. A court's grant of additional motions\npreparation time is ancillary to pretrial motions\nthemselves, which are a listed proceeding. It\nfacilitates the motions because adequate time to prepare\nthem is critical to their fair and accurate resolution.\nThe exclusion is similar to other excludable delays that\nresult from proceedings ancillary to listed proceedings.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I ask a\nspecific date question? Am I right that you would\nexclude the time from September 7th to October 4th?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, the time from\nSeptember 7th to October 4th.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that\ndoesn't -- I'm not sure that makes much sense. Before\nthe motion for extension was filed, the hearing date for\npretrial motions was September 20. After the extension\nwas filed and granted, the hearing date was October 4th.\nSo the only period of delay that you could say resulted\nfrom the extension was from September 20 to October 4,\nor 13 days.\nWell, how can you possibly count the time as\na delay after he filed his extension up to the point\nwhen things would have been due anyway?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, the delay is just the\ntime that's being used for preparation, which was\npresumably the time all the way up to the period at\nwhich the waiver of the intent to file motions was\nfiled.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but how is\nthat a -- how is the time being spent for preparation a\ndelay, when some of that time was going to be allowed\nanyway?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, I think the act --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, the\nmotions were not due until September 25th. So I don't\nsee how the time he spent before then can be regarded as\na delay.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, that's -- that's a\nresult of the fact that the act doesn't exclude the time\nbefore a routine deadline for filing the motion, because\nit only excludes the time -- the delay resulting from an\nindividualized proceeding. But it makes sense not to\nexclude the -- the time before the routine deadline as a\ngeneral matter, because if you excluded all that time,\nthen you -- the result would be that the basic deadline\nof the act would be extended and time would be excluded\nin cases where no time was being used for consideration\nor preparation of pretrial motions. But once you\nknow --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the -- what\nis the proceeding from which you count in determining\nwhat should be excluded?\nMR. ROBERTS: The time running from the\norder of the district court granting additional time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay, that order --\nthat proceeding was initiated and ruled on the same day.\nThe person comes in and says: I would like time. The\njudge that same day says yes.\nMR. ROBERTS: There were --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That proceeding\ntakes a day.\nMR. ROBERTS: The request -- the request for\ntime, that proceeding was done. But the order -- the\norder granting additional time is a proceeding, and the\nadditional time that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The additional time\nflowing from the order is a proceeding?\nMR. ROBERTS: The order -- an order is a\nstep in the case, an act of the court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. ROBERTS: -- and it's a proceeding.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. ROBERTS: And it's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's one day.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, but it's the delay\nresulting from the order that we are talking about.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ah. Now that -- now\n-- now I don't see how that's consistent with the other\nprovisions of the act. If you take (h)(1)(A), that\nexcludes delay resulting from any proceeding to\ndetermine mental competency. Okay?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And under your\ntheory that would include the time from the filing of\nthat motion to the end of the determination of mental\ncompetency, right?\nMR. ROBERTS: I think courts have excluded\nfrom the filing of a motion seeking an examination, yes.\nYou could also, that would probably be excluded under\n(h)(1)(D) --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ah. Well -- yes.\nWell, or -- yes ---no, I'm looking at (h)(4). Now\n(h)(4) excludes any period of delay resulting from the\nfact that the defendant is -- is mentally incompetent.\nMR. ROBERTS: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me\nredundant if you exclude the delay from the examination\nand then also exclude mental incompetence.\nMR. ROBERTS: I don't think so, Your Honor,\nbecause the delay resulting from the examination would\n-- would be excluded from the order granting the\nexamination until the examination was complete. And\nthen there would be a determination of competence or\nincompetence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. Well,\nlet's look at (h)(1)(G). That excludes delay resulting\nfrom consideration by the court of a proposed plea\nagreement. But then (h)(2) says any period of delay in\nwhich prosecution is deferred pursuant to a written --\nwritten agreement with the defendant, for the purpose of\nallowing the defendant to demonstrate his good conduct,\nwhich sounds an awful lot like a plea agreement to me.\nMR. ROBERTS: I don't -- I think that\nthat's -- that that's a different -- a different\ndeferral, Your Honor. It's not for the court's\nconsideration of a plea agreement or even for\nnegotiations. It's saying we're going to take time out\nso that the defendant can demonstrate his -- his good\nconduct.\nI think that the plea agreement provision is\nonce the parties have proposed an agreement to the\ncourt, the court has time to consider whether it should\napprove that and that time's excluded. And in fact\ncourts have excluded the time that the parties are\nengaged in plea negotiations as ancillary to that\nprovision of consideration of the proposed plea\nagreement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I disagree with\nyou that, when the time that is extended before a\nhearing on the pretrial motions and the acceptance of a\nwaiver, which runs from 13 days, September 20, the\noriginal date, and the date that it actually took place,\nwhich is 13 days, and if I think, contrary to your\nsubmission, which is that the whole time from the filing\nof the extension to the final hearing is delay, even\nthough it was only 13 days that was pushed back, then\nyou lose, right?\nMR. ROBERTS: I'm not sure. If you think\nthat the -- that there's delay that results from the\ngrant of the extension, I don't think that the\nPetitioners ever challenged the length of the delay that\nwas excluded, so the only issue that's before the Court\nis whether that delay is excluded.\nI don't know that the Petitioners preserved\nany argument about the length of the delay, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Putting aside what\nPetitioners may or may not have argued, if I think that\nthe delay is only how far the date for consideration of\na motion and acting on the motion has been moved -- in\nthis case, from September 20 to October 4; in other\nwords, it's 13 days, not 28 days -- then you lose,\nright?\nMR. ROBERTS: I'm not sure that we lose. I\nhave to confess that I haven't calculated the -- the\nexact amount of time that that results. In any case,\nthere are other periods of delays --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess it\nwould be, take 15 days from what time you have\ncalculated, and that's -- that's under the wire -- or is\nit above the wire?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yeah. I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, I am\ncontesting 15 of your days, and you figured out how much\ndays you think can be excluded or not excluded.\nMR. ROBERTS: Right. I guess I would say,\nif there was some question about the length of delay,\nthe appropriate thing would be to -- to rule for us on\nthe issue that's before the Court, remand to the courts\nbelow, allow them to decide whether the Petitioners\npreserved the question about the length of delay and\nwhat the effect is on a rule that would only limit the\nadditional delay.\nYou know, we also have other arguments for\nthe fact that we think that, even if this time isn't\nexcluded, that, based on -- based on the additional\npreparation time, that there's still no Speedy Trial Act\nhere, that we raised in the -- in the brief of -- in\nopposition, and we would think that that should be taken\ninto account on any remand like that as well.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was -- what was the\nsecond point you just made, Mr. Roberts? That, even if\nthe clock is running, you would still have an argument\nthat you come within the 70 days because?\nMR. ROBERTS: Because the -- on\nSeptember 25th, Petitioner filed a notice of intent to\nwaive pretrial motions, and then there was a hearing on\nthat on the 4th, and so that filing would be analogous\nto a motion or a motion that would trigger it's own\ndelay, that it would trigger it's own exclusion of time\neven if the time starting on September 7th was not\nexcluded.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just for my -- just for my\ninformation, what's a motion to -- to waive? I mean,\nwhy does he need permission to waive?\nMR. ROBERTS: The -- the court had\noriginally said -- the court had originally provided in\nits order that on the deadline for filing motions the --\nthe Petitioner should either file the motions or\nindicate whether he wanted to waive the motions and then\nset a hearing on either one, on the 4th, and that's what\nhappened.\nAfter he filed that paper on the 4th, the\ncourt held a hearing, and the defendant -- discussed\nwith the defendant personally whether he wanted to waive\nhis right to file motions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I see.\nMR. ROBERTS: And the defendant waived his\nright to file motions, which had a consequence, you\nknow, in the case.\nThe second reason that the additional time\ngranted for preparation of pretrial motions is\nautomatically excluded is that the exclusion in Section\n(h)(1)(D) for delay resulting from pretrial motions\nthemselves excludes the time that a court grants the\nnon-moving party to prepare a response.\nAnd, as Justice Ginsburg, in her questions\nsuggested, it would make little sense automatically to\nexclude time granted to respond to motions, but not the\ntime granted for the specific purpose of preparing them.\nIn fact, this Court employed similar\nreasoning to that in the Henderson case when it held\nthat the Act excludes the time after a court has held a\nhearing on a motion while the court's awaiting further\nwritten submissions.\nThe Court reasoned that it would make no\nsense not to exclude that time because the act excludes\nall the time before the hearing, as well as 30 days\nafter a motion's taken under advisement; and likewise it\nwould make no sense not to exclude time that is\nspecifically granted to prepare motions when the Court\nexcludes the time granted to respond to them.\nThird --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except for the -- for the\nlanguage, which -- which says that you -- you time it\nfrom the beginning of the time granted.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, section -- Section\n(h)(1), Your Honor, expressly states that it excludes\ndelays, including, but not limited, to the listed\ndelays, so no negative inference arises from the fact\nthat the listed examples don't specifically address\ndelays resulting from the grant of additional motions\npreparation time.\nSection (h)(1)(D) is addressing a related,\nbut different delay, the delay from the pretrial motion\nitself.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what's the effect of\nthat language then? Why didn't (D) just read \"delay\nresulting from any pretrial motion\"?\nMR. ROBERTS: Because Congress specifically\namended it in 1979, in response to previous\ninterpretations by some courts that had excluded only\nthe time that was spent in actual court hearings, and\nthe language makes clear that all the time from the\nfiling of the motion through the hearings, including\nthe -- not just the Court hearing time -- is excluded,\nand it -- the language continues to -- to make that\nclear, even if preparation time is also sometimes\nexcluded.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do you disagree\nwith your adversary, that there is no statute of\nlimitations problem if we rule against you?\nMR. ROBERTS: No. I don't think that there\nare statute of limitations problems, Your Honor, but\nrequiring judges to make superfluous ends of justice\nfindings --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But is it superfluous?\nBecause what your adversary is saying is that Congress\nwanted district courts to think about why some things\nwere being -- additional time was being requested. Not\nall motions by defendants would a district court\nactually feel were warranted and might say to that\nindividual if they came in: Look; that shouldn't take\nyou three weeks; that should only take you a week.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, a court should always be\ndoing that in considering whether to grant additional\ntime that's requested, Your Honor. Neither the\ndefendant nor the public is going to have an interest in\nrushing to trial without adequate time to prepare --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that doesn't answer\nmy point. Without a requirement that the judge actually\nhas to make a finding in the interest of justice, once\nthe defense attorney comes in and says, I want a month,\nand isn't the judge required to give him the month\nbecause it's automatically excludable?\nWhat, otherwise, forces the judge to look at\nthe request and say, no; is it really in the interest of\njustice for me to give you that month?\"\nMR. ROBERTS: The -- the judge doesn't have\nto give him the additional time. Presumably, the judge\nshould only give him the -- the additional time if more\ntime is needed to prepare the -- the motions, based on\nthe justification that the defendant --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what -- so what\nadditional requirements are we imposing on the judge\nthat the statute itself doesn't command?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, what --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If the judge always has\nto listen to the reason, weigh it, determine whether or\nnot it is in fact in the interest of justice or not, how\nmuch more burden are we putting on a judge than to say,\nlook, you are right, you need a month; I will exclude it\nunder (7)(H).\nMR. ROBERTS: The judge has to specifically\nconsider all of the specified factors that are in (b)(1)\nthrough (4).\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We have never required\nthe judge to give a litany of each of the factors under\n(h)(7). We have never required him or her to do a\ndetailed finding. We've just required them to say\nthere's some reason for it.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, the court -- the statute\nsays that the judge shall consider the specific factors,\nand some courts at least have -- have reversed -- if\na -- situations where the court hasn't considered the\nfactors.\nIn addition, there have to be specific ends\nof justice findings, which I would respectfully disagree\nwith counsel on the other side: The findings have to be\nmade before the continuance is granted. What --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what Zedner seems\nto suggest.\nMR. ROBERTS: What Zedner says is the\nfindings have to be made before the continuance is\ngranted. They can be recorded later, but they have to\nbe made, because otherwise the continuance isn't made on\nthe basis of the findings. So if the judge didn't go\nthrough, consider the factors, and make the findings, if\nonly in the judge's mind, then the judge shouldn't be\nrecording them later on.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Roberts --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And counsel wouldn't know\nuntil -- wouldn't know whether the time was excluded or\nnot until -- until a later finding is either made or not\nmade.\nMR. ROBERTS: Is recorded. I guess -- I\nguess not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you,\nMr. Roberts, to comment on your opponent's argument that\nyou are creating a rule that if a particular district\nhas a standing order that motions be filed after seven\ndays and then another district has a standing order that\nit be 21 days, the effect of your rule would be to make\nthe seven-day district an 86-day -- give them 86 days\nunder the Speedy Trial Act?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the\nact just doesn't operate so that -- so that all the\ndistricts' excludable delays are even across districts.\nThe exclusion in Section (h)(1)(D), the exclusion for\npretrial motions, excludes the time that's allotted to\nprepare responses. And there is wide variation among\nthe different districts in the time that's allotted to\nprepare responses.\nSo, for example, the Northern District of\nFlorida gives 14 days after the motion. The Northern\nDistrict of Illinois gives ten days after the motion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's for response time.\nMR. ROBERTS: For response time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And that's automatically\nexcluded, so that won't affect the -- well, like you\nsaid, it's --\nMR. ROBERTS: It's going to be different.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. ROBERTS: So it's the same -- it's the\nsame issue. They're just -- it isn't in lockstep.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if the difference is\nspecifically authorized by Congress?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, this is specifically\nauthorized by Congress, too, because section (h)(1) is\n-- is a general exclusion for delay resulting from\nproceedings concerning the defendant.\nAnd, you know, these are -- the list of\nthings are examples only. And this covers those\nproceedings and other proceedings, including those that\nlike this one that are ancillary to the listed ones.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But doesn't it seem fairly\nclear that the district which has a 21-day rule, they\nwon't have to -- normally, they won't need extra time in\nthe routine case for an extra motion, whereas the\ndistricts with a seven-day rule would pretty\nautomatically need another 10 days or so.\nMR. ROBERTS: I think it depends on the\nparticular case and what motions are in -- or what\nmotions are involved, Your Honor.\nBut the -- the rule is going to operate\ndifferentially, too. Under Petitioner's theory, people\ncome in asking for different extensions of time to get\n(h)(7) continuances, which Petitioner says are not going\nto be very difficult to get granted. So I think, both\nin terms of the response time varying and in terms of\nthe rule having the same effect, whether it's excluded\nunder (h)(1) or (h)(7), I'm not sure that you are going\nto ever get a complete parity. That's really not what\nCongress was intending.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, this may be\nthe same question I was asking earlier, but I want to\nmake sure I've got your answer. Let's say the original\ndate for filing motions is, as it was here,\nSeptember 13th, right? On September 7th, Mr. Bloate\nasks for additional time. So the judge's, you know,\nruns a tight ship, and he says, I will give you one day.\nOne more day, so now it's due on September 14th.\nYou would say the delay resulting from that\nextension was seven days, from September 7th, when he\nfiled it, to September 14th, and not one day.\nMR. ROBERTS: That's the way the courts have\ninterpreted it, because once the -- once the\ndetermination has been made that there should be time to\nprepare a response, then you know that you're outside of\nthe case where you don't know whether any of this time\nin the routine deadline is being used for response --\nfor consideration of motions or preparation of motions.\nYou know that counsel is using time for that purpose.\nBut I would say, you know, the same answer\nback to you, that -- that the issue here is whether\nadditional time should -- is excluded when it's granted.\nThe issue isn't how much time should have been excluded.\nAnd if -- if the court thinks that an incorrect amount\nof time has been -- was calculated as excluded, I think\nthat the appropriate thing to do in that circumstance\nwould be for the Court to leave that open on remand,\nassuming that it's -- that it's preserved. But, you\nknow, I think that -- that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you would argue it\nwasn't reserved because both sides thought the period\nwas from September 7th until October 4th, and one\nthought that that whole period should be excluded? That\nwas your position, and then the other side said none of\nit --\nMR. ROBERTS: That's right, Your Honor. I\n-- Petitioner never argued, at least as far as I am\naware, that the error was a miscalculation of the amount\nof time, rather than the exclusion of the time under the\nwrong statutory provision.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How -- how do you think it\nshould work? It seems to me they are two separate\nthings. On September 7th, the defendant comes in and\nsays, \"Judge, you've told me I have to have everything\nready by the 13th. I would like additional time to\nprepare.\" And what he said was, \"until September 25th.\"\nHe said that on the 13th: \"I want until\nSeptember 25th.\" This is what I think the Chief Justice\nis asking, in part.\nNow, what the judge did is excluded\neverything from September 7th all the way to\nOctober 4th. And if I understand your argument -- I'm\nnot sure I agree with it, but on the 7th to the 13th,\nthat really wasn't additional time, but nonetheless,\nmaybe there's something there.\nWhat about the period from the 25th to the\n4th? I don't know what the theory could be on excluding\nthat one, because what the defendant said on the 7th --\non September 13th, he said, \"Judge, I don't want any\nmore time. I don't even want to file any motions.\"\nMR. ROBERTS: On the 25th.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. On the 25th, he said\nthat. So what is the basis of excluding the 25th to the\n4th?\nMR. ROBERTS: As I was saying before, what\n-- he did make a filing on the 25th, and the Court took\naction in response to that filing on the 4th, by holding\na hearing at which he waived the motions as he indicated\nthat he was doing on the -- on the 25th. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the delay -- so\nsaying I'm not going to file any pretrial motions\nresults in a delay from a pretrial motion?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, in this particular\ninstance, Your Honor, he made a filing and then the\nCourt -- the Court held a hearing in response to that,\nand actually engaged in a colloquy with the defendant,\nasked the -- asked the defendant, \"Do you understand\nwhat you are giving up? Do you want to waive these\nmotions?\" He said, \"Yes, I want to do that,\" and the\nCourt ruled, then, on that on the 4th.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that a normal course\nof practice? I've never quite heard of other --\nMR. ROBERTS: I don't think it's a general\npractice, Your Honor. It does seem to be typical in\nthis -- in this district, but I think that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But then the Court's\nview a decision or statement that no motions are going\nto be filed as a request for a waiver of that\nobligation?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, it was in fact a waiver\nnotice, a notice of intent to waive, that the defendant\nfiled. Not just --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Intent to waive.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, I mean, it was framed as\na waiver, a waiver of pretrial motions. It's Docket\nEntry 21. But I don't think it's -- you know, it's in\nthe record, but not in the -- in the JA.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I didn't see it as\na motion. It didn't move to waive. It said, \"I waive.\"\nMR. ROBERTS: That -- that's true, but the\nCourt didn't -- the Court held the hearing on the 4th.\nAnd it engaged in this conversation with the defendant\nand then made a decision on the 4th that the time was\nwaived, that the -- the waiver, not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So it's --\nMR. ROBERTS: Not at the time it was filed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what I understand.\nYou get the period from the -- the 25th to the 4th comes\nunder (D) or (H). It's a motion that is filed, and it's\nunder advisement.\nMR. ROBERTS: I think that the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So it comes under (D) or\n(H). Is that right?\nMR. ROBERTS: It comes under -- it probably\ncomes under (h)(1), Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I don't mean little\n(h)(1). I mean big (H). It's attributed to a period\nduring which any proceedings actually under any\nadvisement -- or maybe it comes under (D) -- a motion\nnot to file a motion is a motion.\nMR. ROBERTS: I mean, it could come under\n(D), Your Honor. It could come under (h)(1). I would\nsay it really comes under both -- best fits under (h)(1)\nas analogous to a motion that's not exactly a motion.\nBut, you know, either way, the point is that\nit was something that the Court required the Court\naction, or at least as the Court had set the rules in\nthis proceeding required Court action, and then it did\nultimately did have Court action on the Court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you repeat that just\nso I have you: It comes under (h)(1) -- what sub?\nMR. ROBERTS: I think just under -- I would\nsay, Your Honor, just under the general language of\n(h)(1), because it's not strictly a pretrial motion, but\nit's the equivalent of a pretrial motion.\nBut you could say that it falls under --\nunder (h)(1)(D), and think of it as a motion itself.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Did --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have any idea of\nhow many, if we rule against you, until we -- speaking\nhypothetically, how many convictions would be at risk\nfor --\nMR. ROBERTS: I couldn't say precisely, Your\nHonor, but it is the rule that's been followed in eight\ncourts of appeals.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's -- it's not\neverybody who invokes a Speedy Trial Act violation\nobjection.\nMR. ROBERTS: No. That's true. That's\ntrue. I mean, I can't say that they are going to be --\nand I would have to agree with -- with Petitioner's\ncounsel that, you know, that there are consequences in\nwhatever ruling that the Court -- that the Court makes\nin a case.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I would have been -- I\nwould have been interested in knowing the effects of\nZedner.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yeah.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And how -- what kind of\nburden it placed.\nMR. ROBERTS: I'm sorry, I don't have any\nprecise -- precise information on that. But I think\nthat, you know, even apart from the transitional effects\nthat there are going to be on a going-forward basis,\nsometimes judges are going -- would -- would grant\nadditional preparation time and neglect to make the\nrequired finding.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's true of all\nSpeedy Trial Act actions by the district court. They\nalways run the risk of forgetting to make a finding.\nThat's why you have two attorneys, presumably --\nMR. ROBERTS: That's right --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to remind them.\nMR. ROBERTS: And that would be perfectly\nappropriate if findings under (h)(7) were necessary.\nBut section (h)(1) is designed to address frequently\nrecurring situations in which the ends of justice are\nvirtually always going to be served by delaying the\ntrial for the purpose. And that's exactly what we have\nhere.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you about the\nlanguage of (h)(1)? Do you think it's -- do you think\nit's proper to consider a period of delay that precedes\nthe filing of the motion? That is, a period of delay in\norder to prepare the motion, as a delay resulting from a\nproceeding that has not yet occurred?\nMR. ROBERTS: No, we -- we agree with that,\nYour Honor. That's why Petitioner is wrong in saying\nthat (D) addresses the delay we are talking about here\nand precludes its recognition under -- under (h)(1).\nThe delay we are talking about here is not resulting\nfrom the pretrial motion, it's resulting from the grant\nof -- the order granting additional time to prepare for\nthe motion. And that, that is the related but different\nproceeding and a different kind of delay related to\nmotions practice. So I would agree with Your Honor\nthat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The grant of the motion is\nthe proceeding?\nMR. ROBERTS: That the order granting the\nadditional time of the proceeding --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is the proceeding.\nMR. ROBERTS: -- and if the delay results\nfrom that order and the order is ancillary to a listed\nproceeding, which is the pretrial motions because it\nfacilitates that proceeding, because it provides for\nadequate preparation, which enabled the motions to be\nresolved favorably and accurately.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But what -- what\nsubsection does all this? I really -- I got lost in --\nMR. ROBERTS: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because you agree, as I\nunderstand it, it is not covered by (D).\nMR. ROBERTS: Right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And what subsection does\ncover it?\nMR. ROBERTS: It's (h)(1), the general\nprovision, which courts have used to exclude numerous --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it's not governed by\nany lettered subsection?\nMR. ROBERTS: No. It's a -- another\nproceeding that -- that is covered by the including but\nnot limited to language on --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But there is no period --\nMR. ROBERTS: -- (h)(1).\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- no subsection talks\nabout another proceeding? That's just your gloss on the\nstatute; is that right?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, I think (h)(1) says any\nperiod of delay resulting from other proceedings\nconcerning the defendant. That could be a period, and\nit covers a whole range of proceedings that generate\ndelay. And then --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I see.\nMR. ROBERTS: Then there is a list of\nexamples. And the examples are intended only to be\nillustrative. And what's -- what's covered is in\naddition to those examples, other proceedings that are\nanalogous or ancillary to them.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you say the order is a\nproceeding for that purpose, the order granting the\nextension of time?\nMR. ROBERTS: That is the proceedings\nbeforehand, Your Honor. Yes. But the -- that's not\nthe -- you know, first of all, as I said, a proceeding\nis a -- is an act done by the court or under the court's\nauthority, so in order to fit squarely within that.\nPlus I would direct you to (h)(1)(F), which indicates\nthat orders can be proceedings here because it excludes\ndelay following an order of removal or an order\ndirecting the transportation of the defendant.\nAnd, so, I think that there's indication in\nthe examples themselves when orders are sometimes\nproceedings.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But just one quick\nquestion. It seems to me that everything described in\n(7)(A) would fit your description of proceedings.\nMR. ROBERTS: It -- there -- there would be\nan order, so there would be a proceeding. But it\nwouldn't be a proceeding that would be covered under\n(h)(1) because it -- to be covered it has to be a\nproceeding of the type that is listed here. It has to\nbe analogous to these proceedings or ancillary to them,\nfacilitating these proceedings in some way, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's a tough argument.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Stancil, five minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCIL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. STANCIL: I would like to quickly\naddress what I hope to be just four points. The first\nis the government's fundamental principle. The\nfundamental tenet is that the specific treatment of\npretrial motions in subparagraph (D) suggests no\nnegative inference or limiting inference on the general\nstandard of (h)(1).\nThe fall on that is evident by looking at\nsubparagraph (h), which automatically excludes up to\n30 days during which a matter is under advisement by the\ndistrict court. If the government's reasoning is\ncorrect, subparagraph (h) just does not address or\ncontains -- or suggests no negative inference on whether\nthe 31st day of a matter being under advisement is\nautomatically excludable under (h)(1). That's why there\nare settle -- in the statutory interpretation.\nWe take the general standard, first of all,\nis it a proceeding? There is no pretrial motion\nproceeding until the motion is filed.\nSecond, if you think there is any\nuncertainty as to what a proceeding is, well, look at\nhow the enumerated subparagraphs that follow, what do\nthey describe. One specifically addresses pretrial\nmotions. It has a starting point and it has an end\npoint. That's the end of this case.\nBut even if you think you want to look\nfurther. Well, is there any support in these enumerated\nsubparagraphs for the government's rule that you would\ntreat a defense request for additional time differently?\nNo. None of the enumerated subparagraphs distinguishes\nbetween defense requests and government requests. None\ndistinguishes between routinely granted time or\nspecifically alloted time.\nIn fact, with respect to defense requests\nspecifically, it was not lost on Congress how to -- how\nto treat government counsel and defense counsel\ndifferently. In (h)(7)(C), which is about the end of\njustice exclusion, it specifies that the government\ncannot get an end of justice exclusion based on its\ninability to exercise due diligence in obtaining a\nwitness or preparing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand -- I\ndon't understand the government to be argue -- to be\narguing that they are treated differently.\nMR. STANCIL: Well, the government's rule I\nthink is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They are saying whoever --\nwhoever asked for the extension of time in order to\nprepare the motion gets it. And -- and it's the time\nlimit's suspended.\nMR. STANCIL: That's not their position in\ntheir brief, Your Honor. They say the defense requests\nfor additional time --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nMR. STANCIL: They don't say anything about\ngovernment request.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- they made it very clear\nhere that they think it applies to both the defendant\nand the government.\nMR. STANCIL: If that's their position, it's\nmore unmoored from the text of subparagraph (D), because\nthen both types of requests -- so subparagraph -- pardon\nme -- so (h)(1)'s general standard is expanded even\nfarther --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You are right, (D) has a\nspecial time limit built into it -- I mean, (h) or\nwhatever the number is now. It says not to exclude\n30 days. Okay?\nMR. STANCIL: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: None of the others do. So\nI would say right there, Congress doesn't want the judge\nto have it for more than 30 days. Congress doesn't say\na word in any of the others that says anything about\npreparation time.\nMR. STANCIL: Well, I disagree about\nsubparagraph (D) Your Honor. (D) says from point B\nto --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I know. But there is\nnot an indication about preparation time. Their\nargument is a literal argument under the statute. Is it\nfrom other proceedings? Yes, we know that because of\n(D), okay? Does it result from other proceedings? Yes,\nbecause, in fact, the preparation time is a direct\nresult of the other proceedings as defined in (D).\nTherefore, it is an ancillary matter related to other\nproceedings that was caused by the other proceedings.\nQED, their argument is literal and there is no policy\nagainst it. That's what they said.\nNow, as soon as you get to the last (h), you\nwould find a big policy against it. Called not\nexceeding 30 days. Now, I take it that's roughly their\nargument.\nMR. STANCIL: But there is no --\nJUSTICE BREYER: At least my interpretation\nof it.\nMR. STANCIL: There is no difference, Your\nHonor, between not exceeding 30 days and from and to.\nAnd I think this is -- this case -- it comes to that and\nthat alone, which is Congress specifically addressed\npretrial motions, any delay resulting from a pretrial\nmotion and it said from point A to point B. And even if\nyou had to look behind that, you would look at the\nlegislative history and the Senate Judiciary Committee\nwas asked a specific question by the government no less,\ncan we include preparation time, and they said no.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, is your\nfriend correct that the issue of the proper calculation\nis not before us? So that the time I spent figuring\nthat out should be excluded from something?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STANCIL: As the question was presented,\nYour Honor, it was specific to preparation time and the\nperiod -- and the period from -- I don't want to get the\ndates wrong but, September 7th to October 4th. But I\nwould add that the government didn't raise this argument\nbelow, either. Nor did the government suggest, as I\nunderstand it, that the delay that's at issue here\nresults from the grant on September 7th of additional\ntime. Rather their argument as I have understood it and\nunderstood it when reading their briefs is that the\ndelay -- the ancillary delay stems from the pretrial\nmotion, the time allotted for pretrial motions itself.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought\nthat whether or not you think that type of delay is\nexcludable depends on what that type of delay is, which\nrequires some sense of how it's going to be calculated.\nMR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does six days make a\ndifference to your case? If they lose six days, do you\nwin?\nMR. STANCIL: I'm not sure, Your Honor, I\nwould have to plead ignorance the same.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel,\nthis case is submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 2:01 p.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n59:6 50:19 51:2 19:11 23:11 26:21 avoids 20:12\n50:2 53:22 43:25 44:14 56:25 57:7,12 awful 31:20\n57:19 52:15 53:14 arises 36:22 b 6:3 8:12,16,16\n54:18
