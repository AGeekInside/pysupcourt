        "content": "(10:57 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 02-749, the Raytheon Company v. Joel\nHernandez.\nMr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nPetitioner, like thousands of other employers\nthroughout this country, has a policy that if an employee\nis discharged for violating a workplace rule -- usually\nthat involves serious misconduct in the -- in the\nworkplace -- then he becomes permanently ineligible to be\nrehired by that particular employer.\nThe court of appeals in this case correctly held\nat Fed.App. 12a, note 17, that there is no question that\npetitioner applied this policy in rejecting respondent's\napplication. And the court of appeals also held that\nthere's no question that this policy on its face is not\nunlawful.\nNonetheless, the Ninth Circuit declared that\neven in a case alleging only disparate treatment, the,\nquote, policy violates the ADA as applied to former drug\naddicts whose only work-related offense was testing\npositive because of their addiction.\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips, it -- the Ninth Circuit\nin its opinion on about page 8a in the appendix said,\nHernandez raises a genuine issue of material fact as to\nwhether he was denied reemployment because of his past\nrecord of drug addiction. And I'm concerned that the\ncourt may have said there is a genuine issue of fact here,\nthat it wasn't clear whether there was a no-hire policy\nthat was either adopted or if it was used in this case,\nthat there's something else at stake due to the different\nresponses of the man who wrote the letter versus the woman\nwho actually made the decision, and that there's some\nissue of fact here.\nNow, if that's the case, maybe the rest of the\nopinion is just dicta. I don't know.\nMR. PHILLIPS: It's pretty clear that the rest\nof the opinion is not dicta, Justice O'Connor. The --\nthat portion of the analysis is -- is directed solely at\nthe question of whether or not the plaintiff had made out\na prima facie case, and what the court said was, you know,\nis there any evidence from which anyone could draw the\ninference that there was discrimination because of a\ndisability. And it recognized frankly that that was a\nvery close question, that if you read even the -- the\nstatement made to the EEOC, you can read that in different\nways. Maybe you should look at Bockmiller.\nBut the truth is in making the prima facie\nshowing, all that you really needed to look at was the\npolicy statement -- or the -- the response to the EEOC,\nand that would be enough, I think, to get you past the\nprima facie showing.\nIt -- it is at page 10a where the court then\nturns its complete attention, and it says, you know, so in\nsum we hold that -- that Hernandez's prima facie case of\ndiscrimination has been made out, and now we turn to the\nnext stage in the process, which is to look and see\nwhether or not there is a -- a non-pretextual\njustification.\nQUESTION: I might agree with you that a no-hire\npolicy, if that's what was used, is certainly not\nunlawful. But if there is a genuine issue of fact here,\nwhat -- what do we do?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, if there were a genuine\nissue of fact, you -- you would -- you know, you'd remand\nto allow the case to go forward. There's clearly not a\ngenuine issue of fact because if you -- once you get past\njust looking at the EEOC statement that was made by the\nemployer and -- and you're in the district court and\nyou're looking at summary judgment and the question is\nwhether or not the action of the employer is pretextual,\nwe only have the burden to come forward and say we had a\n-- a perfectly lawful reason for doing what we did.\nQUESTION: Well, aren't the two questions really\nseverable, whether the Ninth Circuit's treatment of the\nno-rehire policy was correct under ADA law, and second,\nwhether the employer was entitled to summary judgment? I\n-- I think those are two different questions.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- yes, they are two\ndifferent questions, Mr. Chief Justice. I think the\nanswer is that I think we probably would have been\nentitled to summary judgment even on the prima facie\nshowing.\nThe only way the court of appeals got to its\nanalysis -- the only way it could have gotten there under\nHazen Paper -- is to say that the pretextual basis -- the\npretextual argument that was put forward by the employer\n-- we have to take that off the table because if that --\nif that policy is in this case, there is not a shred of\nevidence that that policy was not applied in this\nparticular case. And that's exactly what the court of\nappeals said in -- in the footnote in its opinion. It\nsaid that's unquestioned.\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips, I'm having the same\nproblem that Justice O'Connor and the Chief expressed.\nOne thing is if we take this case, there's a no-hire rule.\nCan an employer have such a rule and apply it with even\nhand? That's a question of law.\nBut this case seems to be underneath messier.\nFor example, this no-hire policy was unwritten. This is a\ncompany that had a lot of written rules. That's an\nimportant rule. Why was it unwritten? Why does Medina\ntestify we had a right, not that we'd apply it every case,\nbut we had a right not to rehire someone who was\ndischarged for cause?\nThe -- the record is suspicious on, one, whether\nthere was a policy; two, whether it was applied with an\neven hand. That one can't tell. So why should a judge\ntake this as given that there was indeed such a policy and\nthat it -- it was applied with an even hand? Don't those\nquestions remain in the case? Even if you prevail on if\nthey had such a policy and if they applied it with an even\nhand, they would not be offending --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean, there's no question that\nrespondent has asserted arguments that the -- that -- that\nthere's a question as to whether the policy exists. The\nNinth Circuit expressly held that the policy exists and\nwas applied in this particular case --\nQUESTION: Well, they held it in a footnote, and\nI'm --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't take footnotes seriously\nin all court's opinions, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, but I mean, it could not\nhave been more explicit in terms of dealing with this\nparticular issue. Was the policy presented and was it --\nwas -- did the policy exist and was it applied in this\nparticular case? There's no question about that.\nAnd there's no testimony that raises any doubt.\nIt may be that it's an unwritten policy, but the testimony\nin the joint appendix at 22a, 57a, 59a, 71a, 72a, and 73a,\nwhich is the affidavit and deposition testimony of\nBockmiller who was the decision maker in this case and\nMedina who signed the -- the statement, is consistent,\nthat -- that there is an absolute policy and practice that\nthis employer uniformly uses.\nQUESTION: We don't know from this record, for\nexample, whether someone who had sexually harassed a\nfellow worker and for that reason was fired, whether such\na policy would apply -- has, in fact, been applied to such\na person, whether someone who assaulted a co-worker would\nalso be barred permanently from re-hire. If there is the\nfirm policy, then it's unquestionably legal, but -- but\nthere isn't in this anything except two employees who gave\ntestimony, no other examples, other than this very case,\nto show that this has been applied across the board.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But Justice Ginsburg, the\nrespondent had a full opportunity for discovery in this\ncase. He was an employee for 25 years. If he had known\nof any instances in which this rule hadn't been applied,\nhe could presumably have brought that forward. If he\ncould have discovered any instance in which this rule had\nnot been applied consistently --\nQUESTION: I thought he said that he didn't even\nknow the rule existed.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Actually he's not specific in --\nin regard to that. I mean, he's made that argument at\nthis stage in the proceedings, but there's nothing in the\nrecord, certainly nothing during the deposition testimony,\nin which he says -- there's nothing in his affidavit.\nBut -- but, Justice O'Connor, it's worth reading\nthe joint appendix -- I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg. I\napologize.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: But, Justice Ginsburg, it's worth\nreading on joint appendix 70a. You know, this -- his\napplication would have been rejected had he been fired for\nstealing or fighting or anything like that. It's\nunequivocal, absolutely uncontradicted testimony in this\nrecord. There is no question --\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips, can I ask you a\nquestion that makes the assumption that you want to make\nfor the whole case, that the policy was just applied in\nthis case? Suppose a person, aware of the policy, right\n-- and has the history of this person, and say you would\nadmit he's qualified. I know there's some doubt about\nthat in this case. A qualified applicant, who has a\nhistory of drug or alcohol use and was fired for that\nyears ago, writes a letter to the company and says I'm\ntotally aware of your policy of not hiring -- rehiring\npeople who were previously discharged for cause, but I\nwant you to know I am a rehabilitated person and therefore\nI'm handicapped and I come within the statute. And I\nthink the -- the rule against discriminating against\nhandicaps requires you to make a special accommodation for\nme. Please do so.\nNow, why could you turn him down?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, you could -- you could\ncontinue to assert that the -- that our policy is our\npolicy and we're entitled to assert that policy.\nNow, you know, there are alternative theories\nthat could be brought forward. One -- one could be that\nthe policy has a disparate impact, which wasn't litigated\nin this case --\nQUESTION: And if --\n10\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- and also --\nQUESTION: -- a whole bunch of people. He says\n-- he admits he's the only person who fits. So he can't\nmake a disparate impact argument. He just says you have a\nduty to accommodate under this statute and your failure to\naccommodate is discrimination when you know that the\nreason for the policy doesn't apply --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there are sort of three\nanswers to that in terms of the reasonable accommodation\nrationale. First of all, remember that this is not an\nemployee any longer who is in fact disabled. This is one\nwho's merely regarded as or has a record of. And the\nstatute specifically talks about accommodating the\nlimitations of the employee. So there -- there are no\nlimitations here. So I think (b)(5) by its terms doesn't\napply.\nQUESTION: Is it your view there's no duty to\naccommodate for applicants? I'm just trying to -- is it\nyour view that the statute does not require any\naccommodation for applicants as opposed to actually\nemployed persons?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't -- I don't know that\nthat doesn't require any -- anything with respect to\napplicants or any accommodation with respect to\napplicants. I don't -- I -- I think what it doesn't do is\nallow you to look beyond whether there are limitations\nthat need to be accommodated. And I don't think it -- and\nI don't think it is a reasonable accommodation within the\nmeaning of (b)(5) to say that you're entitled to a second\nbite of the apple. If you have violated a misconduct rule\nand been discharged for that reason, whether it's drug-\nrelated or not, it seems to me clear under the statute --\ncertainly it's clear under -- under 114(c)(4) -- that that\nis precisely the situation in which the employer is\nallowed to discharge you and to impose on you a permanent\nban.\nQUESTION:\nquestion. The question is whether a person who is now\nhandicapped within the meaning of the statute and who was\npreviously discharged for a reason that clearly does not\njustify rehiring now, other than the fact you want to have\na rule with no exceptions to it. I don't really -- I'm a\nlittle unclear as to if you don't say the duty to\naccommodate has no application to applicants as opposed to\nemployees, I'm a little unclear as to why this isn't like\na rule in the gender discrimination cases, you can't lift\nover 100 pounds or something like that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, because I think the reason\nis is that in order to allow this employee to come back\nunder these circumstances, you have to -- you have to\ndiscriminate in his favor because if -- if this were a\nperson who --\nQUESTION: That's right, and that's always the\ncase of -- of accommodation.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nQUESTION: It's always a discrimination in favor\nof the applicant.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but that's why you have to\nlook at 114(c)(4), which says specifically that you are\nentitled to treat former drug addicts precisely the way\nyou would treat any other employee.\nI think is if this employee had been discharged originally\nbecause he was a sex offender or a sexual harasser and --\nand had a psychological reason for it, and he came back in\nand he said, I'm -- I'm cured, I'm fixed, I want to come\nback to work now, the answer there might be one thing. I\ndon't know the -- you know, there may be a reasonable\naccommodation issue there.\nBut with respect to 114(c)(4), which very\nspecifically says that you're allowed to impose\nqualification standards that are the same where you're not\ngoing to allow that other employee to come in -- that's\nthe way your policy operates -- applying that rule fairly\nto this situation means that this employee is not entitled\nto come in.\nI don't think it's a flat rule against\napplicants versus non-applicants. I think it's a (c)(4)\n-- 114(c)(4) rule that says that you are always entitled\nto treat the rehabilitated drug addict exactly the same\nway you would treat anyone else who engaged in misconduct.\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips, I guess the Ninth\nCircuit did not address at all the reasonable\naccommodation question, did it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't think it did address the\nreasonable accommodation issue.\nQUESTION: No. So I guess we'd have a hard time\nin getting into it, but it --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Any more than it --\nQUESTION: -- may be a serious question.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it might be and -- and I\ndon't think it would be in this case. As I say, I think\n114(c)(4) is a complete answer to the reasonable\naccommodation argument, and I think frankly 114(c)(4) is a\ncomplete answer to the disparate impact argument, which\nthe court of appeals also not only didn't get into, but\nfound had been expressly waived.\nThat's why I think, Justice O'Connor, at the end\nof the day, what this case is about is Hazen Paper. We\nhave a rule here that was unquestionably applied. There\nis not a shred of evidence that it wasn't applied.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Phillips, one of the things\nis -- doesn't quite fit is in the case of this very\nemployee. He was given a test despite this firm no-hire\n-- no-rehire rule. They did give him a test in 1999, and\nit turned out he flunked it badly. But everyone\nrecognizes that flunking in 1999, when you're a little\nrusty, doesn't mean you would have flunked in 1994, which\nis the critical time here. But why did the company, if it\nhas this firm -- firm, no-exception policy, no rehires,\nwhy did it give him the test to see if he was qualified?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, because any employers who's\nin the middle of litigation would be irrational not to try\nto find some kind of a non-litigated solution to the\nproblem. And so we were looking for a non-litigated\nsolution to the problem. Since he wasn't qualified in\n1999, it wasn't available to us to bring him back or to\ntry to come up with some other kind of a settlement. I\nthink it completely inappropriate to hold it against us to\ntry to come up with a solution to this case that wouldn't\nhave required us to take the time of the court at that\npoint.\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips, looking at 114(c)(4), I\nthink that speaks to the -- what the company may do to\nemployees, not -- it doesn't speak to former employees --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nQUESTION: -- or applicants for employment.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But -- but, of course, Mr.\nHernandez was an employee in 1991.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. PHILLIPS: And we discharged him and then we\nimposed on him the same qualification standards that we\nwould impose to anyone that we discharged under those\nexact same circumstances. He is dismissed.\nQUESTION: I understand.\nMR. PHILLIPS: And he is permanently barred on\n-- on a going-forward basis.\nQUESTION: But I don't think (c) --\nMR. PHILLIPS: That language clearly covers\nthis.\nQUESTION: I don't think (c)(4) explains why you\ndidn't have a duty to accommodate him when he -- when he\nsought re-employment.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the answer to that\nis (c)(4) would -- would trump the reasonable\naccommodation argument, if -- if it had been properly\nraised and it were before the court. I think at the end\nof the day, we'd win that, but Justice O'Connor -- I got\nthe name right there -- is clearly right that that issue\nwasn't resolved by the Ninth Circuit, and therefore\nremains open. I mean, it is not an issue for this Court\nat this point.\nI just want to make it absolutely clear that the\nrule was applied -- I don't think there is any way that\nyou can question that there is an issue of fact to be\nresolved as to how this rule was applied in this\ncircumstance. In order to discount the applicability of\nthe rule as the basis for Mr. Hernandez's rejection, you\nhave to declare that Ms. Bockmiller flat-out lied, and she\ndidn't. Everything in the record in this case is\nconsistent with the idea that she looked at the summary\nseparation, she concluded that there was no basis to go\nforward with this case, and she acted accordingly. An\nemployee -- obviously, employers are allowed to use their\nown employee's testimony. It cannot be that that's an\ninterested witness whose testimony is not entitled to\ncredit when it is absolutely uncontradicted.\nSo we are not only entitled to have this rule\nset aside, we're also entitled to judgment at the end of\nthe day.\nThank you, Your Honors. I'd reserve the balance\nof my time.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Phillips.\nMr. Clement, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nA policy -- a mutual policy of refusing to\nrehire individuals previously terminated for serious\nmisconduct does not constitute disparate treatment for\npurposes of the Americans with Disabilities Act even as\napplied to an individual previously discharged for drug-\nrelated misconduct. The policy does not single out people\nwho are addicted or those who test positive for drugs for\ndisfavorable treatment. The policy treats all serious\nmisconduct, whether drug-related or not, the same.\nAs a result, an individual who is refused re-\nemployment pursuant to that policy is simply not subject\nto disparate treatment because of their disability.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, does the Government take\na position on whether there's an issue of fact hidden in\nthis case about whether there is a neutral no-hire policy?\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice O'Connor, in our brief we\nsuggested that it would be possible to grant summary\njudgment for the employer here on this record. I have to\nconfess, though, that that issue is of considerable less\nimportance to the Government than the broader validity of\nthis rule. One thing I -- I'll address why we think\nsummary judgment might be appropriate, but I want to\nemphasize, though, that even if the Court thinks that\nsummary judgment is not appropriate here, the proper\ndisposition would be to vacate and remand.\nBut it's very important to vacate the opinion\nbecause the theory of the Ninth Circuit, if you can divine\none here, is that, all right, there's a pretextual case\nfor discrimination and the employer comes in and says, we\ndidn't discriminate on the basis of disability. We\napplied a neutral, across-the-board rule. And as I read\nthe Ninth Circuit opinion, what they say is that neutral\nrule is not a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for your\nemployment action. And they -- they do that as a matter\nof law, and that is a profoundly wrong decision as a\nmatter of law, especially in a disparate treatment case\nbecause Justice Stevens suggested that maybe you could\nhave a reasonable accommodation theory but that's not in\nthis case. It is possible that the language of 42 U.S.C.\n12112(b)(6), which embodies the Americans with\nDisabilities Act disparate impact principles, could be\nused to challenge the neutral policy. But whatever else\nis true, when an employer applies a neutral policy, it has\nnot engaged in disparate treatment on the basis of\ndisability.\nNow, if I can get back to the summary judgment\nquestion. I think there's two reasons why we thought\nsummary judgment was -- would be appropriate for the\nemployer.\nOne is as suggested by Mr. Phillips. In\nfootnote 17, after the court of appeals finishes with its\npretext analysis, it seems to suggest that there's really\nno dispute that both sides agree that this policy was\ninvoked. And I think in -- in looking through the lower\ncourt record, it doesn't seem like the gravamen of the\nrespondent's case was that the policy doesn't exist. It\nwas more a -- a suggestion that whether or not you have a\npolicy, as to me in particular that's not the reason for\nthe discharge, and the best evidence of that, of course,\nis the letter that George Medina sent to the EEOC.\nQUESTION: You mean the best evidence supporting\nthe plaintiff.\nMR. CLEMENT: Yes, the best evidence that the\nplaintiff has is that letter to the EEOC from Mr. Medina.\nAnd, of course, that letter suggests that it was more\ncomplicated than simply application of a neutral policy,\nand it's for that reason that the EEOC issued a -- a cause\nto sue letter.\nUnfortunately, though, Mr. -- Mr. Medina was not\nthe ultimate decision maker in this case. That was Joanne\nBockmiller. And the record is clear -- and this is at\njoint appendix 51a and then 64a. It's clear that Ms.\nBockmiller did not participate in the preparation of that\nMedina letter.\nQUESTION:\nQUESTION: I don't know that -- I don't know\nthat that's enough, though, to defeat summary judgment. A\njury is entitled to disbelieve any witness I believe, even\nthough perhaps the -- you don't show any bias on the part\nof the witness.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that's\nnot the way I read this Court's decision in Anderson\nagainst Liberty Lobby, which seems to suggest that simply\nthe possibility that the jury will not disbelieve\ntestimony even if there's no other evidence that draws\nthat testimony into question --\nQUESTION: But there is.\nMR. CLEMENT: -- it's not enough.\nQUESTION: You mentioned Medina, Medina's\nletter, which says, look, we -- we refused to hire this\nperson because he didn't show -- he didn't show that he\nwas no longer an addict.\nMR. CLEMENT: And I think that if the Medina --\ncertainly if Medina were the decision maker or even one of\nthe decision makers in this case --\nQUESTION: But didn't the company designate him\nto put in the response to EEOC?\nMR. CLEMENT: They certainly did, but the -- the\nfacts of this case are that Bockmiller was the ultimate\ndecision maker. And in Hazen Paper, this Court suggested\nthat in these kind of disparate treatment cases, what\nyou're looking for is if --\nQUESTION: What is the relative position in the\ncompany? I had the impression that Medina was a higher\nlevel employee than Bockmiller.\nMR. CLEMENT: I think that's correct, Justice\nGinsburg, but at the end of the day, he just wasn't the\ndecision maker.\nI think, though, I -- I've made our position\nclear, which is when you have a case where there's an\nultimate decision maker who suggests a neutral policy was\ninvolved, our position would be a -- a straight statement\nby somebody who was not involved in -- directly in the\ndecision making process shouldn't preclude summary\njudgment.\nI do want to be clear, though, that that really\nis the less important issue for the -- from the\nGovernment's perspective because the Ninth Circuit's\ndecision in this case does embody the position that this\nkind of neutral policy, assuming it exists for a moment,\nis somehow per se unlawful as applied to drug addicts.\nAnd I think, again as Justice Stevens suggested, there may\nbe ways that a plaintiff could try to go after such a\nneutral policy. They could suggest that it -- that under\na reasonable accommodation theory, a reasonable\naccommodation must be given. But if that were brought\nforward, I think an employer would have an opportunity to\nsay, no, that reasonable accommodation imposes an undue\nhardship.\nIn similar fashion -- and I would say this. I\nthink if you look at the statute as a whole, the provision\nof the statute that most specifically speaks to a neutral\nqualification criteria that is alleged to have a disparate\nimpact on individuals with a disability is -- is 42 U.S.C.\n12112(b)(6).\nQUESTION: Well, there's no disparate impact\ncase here. That was not raised, was it?\nMR. CLEMENT: No, that was not raised.\nQUESTION: I don't know what about the\nreasonable accommodation theory. The Ninth Circuit didn't\naddress that.\nMR. CLEMENT: They --\nQUESTION: Was that a claim?\nMR. CLEMENT: No, that was never addressed in\nthe lower courts.\nQUESTION: No. That's what I thought. So we\ndon't have to get into that.\nMR. CLEMENT: You don't have to get in, and we\nwould suggest that you not definitively resolve the\nreasonable accommodation issue or the disparate impact\ntheory.\nBut that doesn't mean that it's sort of harmless\nerror if the Ninth Circuit opinion stays on the book\nbecause the Ninth Circuit assumes that the answer to the\nquestion on reasonable accommodation is that you could\nnever justify such a policy. You'd always have to grant a\nreasonable accommodation.\nThe Ninth Circuit opinion assumes that there\nwould be a disparate impact even when there's not or even\nif the employer could justify the policy as job-related\nand consistent with business necessity.\nI wanted to be responsive to Justice Stevens'\nquestion, though, even though I think this Court should\nultimately not reach it. With respect to reasonable\naccommodation, there's no question that reasonable\naccommodation applies in the application process. And so\nif you have -- for example, if you're going -- an employer\nwants to give a application test for the job, and puts it\nin a facility that's not wheelchair accessible, that\nreasonable accommodation would have to be given, and that\nwould be a reasonable accommodation in the hiring process.\nI do think, though, that subsection (b)(6)\naddresses very directly a neutral qualification standard\nthat's alleged to screen out an individual with a\ndisability or to tend to screen out an individual with a\ndisability. And with respect to that claim, that would\ntrigger the employer's burden to come forward and show\nthat the requirement was job-related and consistent with\nbusiness necessity.\nOne of the real sort of ironies, if you will, of\nthe Ninth Circuit's opinion is on the same page of the\nopinion and in consecutive footnotes, after they -- they\nclearly hold that the disparate impact theory is not in\nthis case, they also fault the employer for not justifying\nthe neutral rule as consistent with business necessity.\nBut the business necessity defense, as its status as a\ndefense, suggests is not some sort of free-floating\nobligation on the employer, especially in a disparate\ntreatment case where the employer has already pointed to a\nneutral and legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for their\nactions. The business necessity defense comes into a case\nwhen a plaintiff has properly preserved a claim under\nsubsection (b)(6) and triggers the obligation of the\nemployer to come through.\nI would like to also point out, though, that we\nlargely agree with Mr. Phillips that there is -- there is\nmuch in 42 U.S.C. 12114(c)(4) that suggests that there may\nbe a basis for an employer to maintain this kind of\nneutral policy, and I think an employer may be able to use\nthat section as a defense.\nI would agree with Justice Stevens that it\ndoesn't speak directly to this situation because all it\ndoes is allow -- with respect to current drug users who\naren't entitled to any protection under the act, it\nclarifies that an employer can apply a neutral\nqualification standard, and it doesn't matter whether the\nunderlying misconduct has its roots in -- in drug use or\ndrug addiction. And I think it doesn't directly say it,\nbut implicit in that provision is the idea that an\nemployer can use uniform and neutral sanctions for\nviolations of those uniform conduct rules.\nThe difficult question becomes whether or not\nthere's something special about a bar on re-employment,\nwhen you say that if you violate our conduct rules not\nonly are you terminated, but you need never darken our\ndoor again. And I think with respect to that kind of\npolicy, there are two -- the act, in a sense, points in\ntwo different directions. On the one hand, the act draws\na clear distinction between current drug users who are --\nwho are not protected by the act and draws a distinction\nbetween recovered addicts who are protected by the act.\nIn --in any event, the Court can reconcile those competing\npolicies in a subsequent case.\nQUESTION: Thank you very much, Mr. Clement.\nMr. Montoya, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN G. MONTOYA\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MONTOYA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn the Ninth Circuit's opinion, the court made\nit emphatically clear that there were two predicates for\nits decision. One was a traditional discriminatory impact\nanalysis, what Raytheon's intent was upon dismissal. And\nthis is all very clear, reprinted at page 12a and 13a of\nthe appendix. The court says that Mr. Hernandez has,\nquote, presented sufficient evidence from which a jury can\nconclude -- could conclude that he was qualified for the\nposition he sought in 1994 and that is application was\nrejected because of his record of drug -- drug addiction.\nPeriod. Additionally -- and then it goes to the question\nof whether or not this alleged uniform practice is, in\nfact, valid under the Americans with Disability Act. So\nthere are two grounds for the decision.\nAnd moreover, because this could be a mixed\nmotive case, even if this Court concludes that the alleged\noral practice is valid, the case would still have to be\nremanded because you -- even if the employer had a valid\nreason to terminate Mr. Hernandez, if it also had a mixed\nmotive and the other motive was invalid, it was -- he was\nalso terminated and based upon his history of drug and\nalcohol addiction, the case has to be resolved by a jury.\nAnd the question --\nQUESTION: Mr. Montoya, I'd like to go back to\nthe opening statement you made because you -- you said\nthis was a legitimate disparate impact case, but looking\non that same page in the footnote, the Ninth Circuit is\nagreeing with the district court that because Hernandez\nfailed to timely raise disparate impact, this has got to\nbe a disparate treatment case.\nMR. MONTOYA: Your Honor, I misspoke. If I said\ndisparate impact, I meant to say discriminatory intent.\nThe question of Raytheon's intent. Did it apply this\nalleged uniform practice or did it discriminatorily intend\nto terminate Mr. Hernandez because he has this record of\ndrug and alcohol addiction? They're distinct bases.\nQUESTION: You don't mean terminate. You mean\nrefuse to hire.\nMR. MONTOYA: Refuse to hire, yes. I -- I --\nand -- and both --\nQUESTION: I mean, that makes good sense, but\nhow do you reconcile that with footnote -- footnote 17?\nIt says, there is no question, the court says, that Hughes\napplied its automatic policy, this policy, in rejecting\nHernandez's application. I mean, I -- it boggles the\nmind.\nMR. MONTOYA: Your Honor, that is a -- I -- I\ncan't resolve that.\nQUESTION: You want us to give text more weight\nthan footnotes.\nMR. MONTOYA: I do, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: That's not unreasonable.\nMR. MONTOYA: -- because that footnote is\ndirectly contrary to the record. In fact, in the\ndistrict --\nQUESTION: Maybe the law clerks wrote the\nfootnotes and the judges wrote the text.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MONTOYA: I won't speculate on that, Your\nHonor.\nBut I -- I will say that I disagree with my\nlearned friends representing Raytheon that we admitted\nthat this oral practice was applied to Mr. Hernandez in\nthis case because we don't even think that the practice\nexists. The reason why we don't think the practice exists\nis because in Raytheon's first official written statement\nin this very case, Raytheon doesn't mention it. It\ndoesn't mention a practice. It doesn't mention a rule.\nIt doesn't represent -- or it doesn't indicate that\nthere's a policy. It just says there's a right, which is\nvery different.\nQUESTION: But the Ninth -- the Ninth Circuit\nagain, Mr. Montoya, in footnote 17 simply says there's no\nquestion that Hughes applied this policy in rejecting\nHernandez's application.\nMR. MONTOYA: I know it says that Justice --\nChief Justice Rehnquist. I think what the Ninth Circuit\nmeant in that footnote is that there's no question that\nRaytheon claims that it applied that. And I think what\nthe Ninth Circuit was trying to get at was that even if\nRaytheon's story is true, Raytheon still doesn't\nnecessarily win because Raytheon's alleged practice could\nbe violative of the ADA as applied to Mr. Hernandez in\nthis particular case. But the question of discriminatory\nintent remains.\nMoreover and just as importantly, the question\nof whether or not this alleged practice exists remains.\nThis is an oral -- this is a right that Raytheon alleged.\nThere's no -- no evidence that this rule was ever applied\nto anyone else.\nQUESTION: We -- we didn't take the case to --\nto determine whether -- you know, to determine that. I\nmean, I -- the court of appeals proceeded on the\nassumption that it did exist, and -- and the reason we\nhave the case is that it is a very important proposition\nof law, which the Ninth Circuit adopted, that where you\nhave such a policy, it will not be applicable to someone\nwho's a rehabilitated drug addict.\nMR. MONTOYA: Yes, that's --\nQUESTION: That's the reason we took the case,\nand you're telling us we can't get to it because --\nbecause in fact the Ninth Circuit was just wrong that\nthere was the policy at all.\nMR. MONTOYA: That is correct, Your Honor, and I\nbelieve that that is a question of disputed material fact.\nQUESTION: Did -- did you raise this in your --\nin your brief in opposition to certiorari?\nMR. MONTOYA: Yes, we did, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: That particular question?\nMR. MONTOYA: Yes, we did. We believe that the\nquestion presented in the petitioner's cert petition is\nhypothetical because it's contingent upon at least two\ndispositive material factual disputes, the question of\ndiscriminatory intent and the question of whether or not\nthis uniform practice actually exists.\nQUESTION: Well, but the Ninth Circuit, I take\nit, was entitled to proceed on the assumption that the\nfactual determination might turn out as -- as Hughes says\nit is, and it then went on and gave instructions as to how\nthe case ought to be resolved. And we certainly can reach\nthat if we think it's in error.\nMR. MONTOYA: Yes, you can. However, I think\nthat in order to reach that, you have to make a factual\nassumption that might be incorrect, and I think that it\nwould be premature for the Court to render that assumption\nor to make that assumption at this juncture because it\ncould be that if this case were remanded to the trial\ncourt, jury instructions would render that aspect of this\nCourt's opinion moot. For example, a jury could answer\naffirmatively whether or not --\nQUESTION: Did the court of appeals exceed its\nauthority under Article III in making the statements it --\nit did with respect to the lawfulness of the termination\npolicy?\nMR. MONTOYA:\ncertainly reached the borders of Article III. Maybe a\ndeclaratory judgment action could have been filed --\nQUESTION: So you think that in some later case\nthe Ninth Circuit would -- would say that this is not\nbinding on other panels?\nMR. MONTOYA: Well, it would depend upon the\nfacts. If the assumed facts were identical, then perhaps\nit would be binding. However, those facts are clearly\nassumptions in this particular case.\nQUESTION: Well, if -- if facts might be proven\nfrom the record, courts of appeals routinely give\ndirections to the trial courts as to how the law is to be\napplied, don't they?\nMR. MONTOYA: That's true, Your Honor. However,\nthat makes this case much less worthy of this Court's\nconsideration at this juncture because even though the\nNinth Circuit is perhaps closer to the district court and\nhas more judicial resources to resolve those types of\ndeclaratory questions, those questions might, once again,\nbe rendered moot in this particular case if the jury\nconcludes that there was no oral practice and that in fact\nit was made up, or if the jury concludes that\nnotwithstanding any oral practice --\nQUESTION:\nstill have achieved what we set out to achieve, and that\nis to determine whether the statement of law that the\nNinth Circuit opinion sets forth is correct or not --\nMR. MONTOYA: That -- that --\nQUESTION: -- that if there -- if there is a\nfiring solely by reason of policy, it is nonetheless\ninvalid as applied to a rehabilitated drug addict. That's\nan important proposition. We would resolve that one way\nor other, even though your case might continue on. So\nwhat? We don't care whether your case continues on.\nMR. MONTOYA: Well, in -- in that -- in that\nevent, Justice Scalia, the answer --\nQUESTION: I mean, you care a lot. I know that,\nbut that's -- that's not what's important to us.\nMR. MONTOYA: I understand.\nAnd -- and the answer to Raytheon's petition in\nthat event would be a resounding yes. The ADA does grant\npreferential rehiring rights to an employee who was\nterminated for misconduct if four conditions are met. The\nmisconduct was related to a disability as defined by the\nADA. The disabled individual in question is rehabilitated\nfrom the disabling addiction that this case concerns. And\nRaytheon is unable to establish undue hardship as an\naffirmative defense.\nbusiness necessity as an -- as a affirmative defense.\nQUESTION: Undue hardship being under the\naccommodation requirement?\nMR. MONTOYA: Yes.\nQUESTION: But now, the -- the court of appeals\nnever got to that.\nMR. MONTOYA: Well, they -- they didn't get to\nit using that terminology. However, they did get to it in\nsaying that this uniform rule violated the ADA as applied\nto Mr. Hernandez in this particular case.\nQUESTION: Well, but surely, if they had meant\nthe -- the part of the -- the part of the act that\nrequires accommodation, they would have said so.\nMR. MONTOYA: Well --\nQUESTION: I mean, you're really kind of\nrewriting the court of appeals' opinion, it seems to me.\nMR. MONTOYA: Well, Your Honor, I don't know\nwhether you'd call it a reasonable accommodation or a\nrelaxation of the qualification requirement because the --\nthe ADA, under 12112(b)(6), does apply to qualification\nstandards, employment tests, or other selection criteria\nthat screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a\ndisability or a class of individuals. And that's what the\nNinth Circuit, by any other words, was talking about in\nthis case. There's a -- an alleged, a highly disputed\nqualification standard that screens out this particular\nindividual, Mr. Joel Hernandez.\nQUESTION: What disability would you be\naccommodating?\nMR. MONTOYA: You would be accommodating the\ndisability of disabling addiction to drugs and alcohol.\nQUESTION: He doesn't have that disability.\nMR. MONTOYA: Well, but the ADA --\nQUESTION: He used to have it but he doesn't\nhave it --\nMR. MONTOYA: But the ADA -- under the\ndefinition of disability set forth by the ADA, Justice\nScalia, someone with a record of a disability is in fact\ndisabled under the statute.\nQUESTION: He is in fact disabled, but -- but\nwhat -- what disability of his are you accommodating?\nMR. MONTOYA: His former -- you're relaxing a\nqualification standard that would -- that would hinder the\nentrance of a reformed alcoholic who was disabled under\nthe statute into the job market, which is the purpose of\nthe ADA, not to segregate disabled individuals who can\nwork from the job market.\nQUESTION: But when he comes back years later,\nhe's not disabled.\nMR. MONTOYA: Well, it -- it -- Justice\nO'Connor --\nQUESTION: It doesn't fit.\nMR. MONTOYA: -- it doesn't fit in --\nQUESTION: No.\nMR. MONTOYA: -- to the traditional reasonable\naccommodation analysis.\nQUESTION: No.\nMR. MONTOYA: However, it does fit into the\nstatute, to the language of the statute, 12(b)(6), those\nqualification standards that screen out. Under the ADA,\nthose have to be relaxed. Whether you call the relaxation\nof those standards reasonable accommodation or whether you\ncall it something else, substantively it's the same thing.\nIt is an accommodation of a qualification standard or a\nrelaxation of a qualification standard based upon a\nparticularized inquiry regarding an individual applicant.\nThat's what the ADA expressly demands in the language of\nthe statute itself, and that's what the Ninth Circuit was\ntalking about in this case when it said Raytheon's alleged\nuniform practice violated the ADA.\nQUESTION: And that's what the Solicitor General\nsays is not really presented in this case, though.\nMR. MONTOYA: Well, it's hard to say that it's\nnot presented in this case, Justice Stevens, because the\nNinth Circuit addressed that very issue.\nQUESTION: Well, they didn't address section\n112, though.\nMR. MONTOYA: Well, it didn't cite 112, but it\n-- it --\nQUESTION: They didn't cite it, and they said\nit's not a disparate impact case, too.\nMR. MONTOYA: And I -- I think what the Ninth\nCircuit meant by that, Justice Stevens, is that we're not\ntalking about a class of individuals treated disparately.\nWe're talking about one individual who was treated\ndiscriminatorily. And the ADA also --\nQUESTION: He's only discriminatorily treated\nbecause he's a member of a -- of a specially defined\nclass, namely, reformed alcoholics and -- and drug-\naddicted persons. That for that record makes him a\ndisabled person. He's kind of in a unique class.\nThe -- the court of appeals really did not focus\non this part of the case.\nMR. MONTOYA: Well, Your Honor, even though\nthere's that language regarding disparate impact, it\nnevertheless ruled the way it did and said that this --\nand -- and in fact, the -- the Ninth Circuit --\nQUESTION: But the ruling that it adopted, as I\nunderstand the statute, really deprived the employer of an\nopportunity to -- to set forth any of the affirmative\ndefenses that would be available, business necessity, and\nso forth.\nMR. MONTOYA: Well, Your Honor, the employer had\nthe ability to assert those affirmative defenses in its\ncomplaint in the district court, which is part of the\nrecord in this case, and it did not. Undue hardship,\nbusiness necessity, direct threat, all of those --\nQUESTION: They don't need to assert those\ndefenses if someone was claiming a failure to accommodate,\nand if that was not what was before the house, they'd have\nno incentive to do that.\nMR. MONTOYA: Well, clearly, Justice Scalia, Mr.\nHernandez was challenging this rule that screened him out,\nand if in fact --\nQUESTION: But why do we even get to that? This\nis -- this case is so puzzling on -- for many reasons, but\none thing is Medina or Medina said he didn't come up with\none shred of proof that he's no longer an addict, and we\nare permitted -- being an addict is not a disability\nwithin the ADA, being an addict. Being a reformed addict\nis. So said this employer, look, he sent a letter -- he\nsent a letter from his church pastor. He sent a letter\nfrom Alcohol Anonymous. Maybe that shows that he's no\nlonger an alcoholic, but there's not one thing here that\nsays he's no longer addicted to cocaine. And there -- and\nI don't -- I didn't find anything either that said that.\nMR. MONTOYA: Well -- well, Your Honor, I think\nthat if you construe the facts and the inferences in Mr.\nHernandez's favor, as you must, Mr. John Lyman's letter,\nwho is the AA sponsor, says that he is in recovery from\naddiction. And if you construe the inferences in Mr.\nHernandez's favor on a motion for summary judgment, I\nthink that that would also include his addiction from\nother substances as well.\nQUESTION: Even though this is -- this is solely\nfrom someone who knows him from the alcohol program.\nIsn't the most logical assumption if he's got a letter\nfrom an AA counselor, that what they're talking about is\nalcohol addiction?\nMR. MONTOYA: Yes, Your Honor. However, because\nAA offers a rehabilitation program for any type of alcohol\nor substance abuse, I don't think it would really matter\nin this case if you construe the facts and the inferences\nin favor of Mr. Hernandez, as you must, because he was the\nnon-moving party in the context of a motion for summary\njudgment.\nQUESTION: The inference you want us to construe\nin his favor is that alcohol means things other than\nalcohol. Is that --\nMR. MONTOYA: Well -- well --\nQUESTION: Is that a favorable inference, or is\nit a wild leap into the -- into the dark?\nMR. MONTOYA: I -- I don't think it's a wild\nleap into the dark, and I think it's supported by the text\nof Mr. John Lyman's letter.\nQUESTION: Where is that letter so we can\nlook --\nMR. MONTOYA: It is appendix 14a, Justice\nGinsburg, and it says, Joel attends AA regularly,\nparticipates in discussion when appropriate, and is\nmaintaining his sobriety, and is in all a good and active\nmember. Mr. Hernandez is maintaining his sobriety.\nQUESTION: Sobriety.\nMR. MONTOYA: That is a general statement. And\nthere are many --\nQUESTION: Really? I -- I -- you -- you refer\nto somebody who's a recovered drug addict as he's now\nsober?\nMR. MONTOYA: Yes, clean and sober.\nQUESTION: Gee, I don't think so. I think sober\nis -- refers to drunkenness.\nMR. MONTOYA: I -- I think it can refer to\nany --\nQUESTION: You say a drug addict is stoned. You\ndon't say he's --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MONTOYA: Well, I -- I think -- I think that\nif someone is not on drugs, someone can be described as\nclean and sober. Sober means --\nQUESTION: But in the next paragraph, it says,\nAlcohol Anonymous has been demonstrated the best recovery\ntool for alcoholics.\nMR. MONTOYA: That is true, Justice Ginsburg.\nQUESTION: And it says he's -- he's committed to\nthis program, demonstrates his willingness to accept\nresponsibility for his recovery.\nMR. MONTOYA: But this letter -- this letter is\nunequivocal that he was in recovery. This letter is\nunequivocal that he was maintaining his sobriety, and I --\nand I contend that it is reasonable to believe that\nthere's more than -- alcohol is just one form of drug, and\nalcohol is a drug that impacts sobriety. There are other\ndrugs that impact sobriety, and cocaine impacts sobriety.\nI think that the clear import of this letter is that he is\nclean and sober in all respects and is taking\nresponsibility for his recovery in all respects.\nAnd the point that Justice Ginsburg brings up is\nnot a point that the trial court gave any credence to.\nIt's not a point that the court of appeals gave any\ncredence to. And that is really the type of argument that\nI would contend should be presented to the jury. And --\nand that's especially true in this case because Raytheon\nclaims --\nQUESTION: Whether or not summary judgment\nshould be granted is a question of law, not -- not a\nquestion of fact. And so the same arguments can be made\nin -- in every court that's considering it I think.\nMR. MONTOYA: That is -- that is correct.\nHowever, depending upon the weight of the evidence,\nsome --\nQUESTION: The weight of the evidence has\nnothing to do with summary judgment.\nMR. MONTOYA: Well -- well, if -- if there's a\nfactual dispute, Justice Rehnquist, then the summary\njudgment is no longer -- then summary judgment is no\nlonger appropriate.\nWhat I perhaps should have stated is that this\n-- this letter renders summary judgment inappropriate in\nreference to the question of whether or not Mr. Hernandez\nis maintaining his recovery.\nQUESTION: I thought you were going to say that\nthe -- what the plaintiff claimed is a witness. The\nplaintiff says, I've had this whatever the -- the moment\nwas.\nI woke up one day and said no more and ever since then\nI've been clean. So the -- so the -- the plaintiff did --\nthat was the only proof. That might not be very\nconvincing, but it was a statement --\nMR. MONTOYA: That -- that is true. That is\npart of the record. And moreover and more importantly,\nthat is unrebutted below. At no time in this proceedings\ndid Raytheon ever question Mr. Hernandez's rehabilitation.\nOn July 4th of 1992 in his affidavit, Mr. Hernandez said\nthat he embraced Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior and\nforeswear drugs and alcohol. That is in his affidavit.\nThat is unrefuted.\nAnd more important -- and just as importantly,\nRaytheon didn't subject him to an IME. Under rule 35,\nhey, you say you're -- you're rehabilitated? Prove it.\nLet's send you to a physician to let him ascertain that.\nThe question of rehabilitation is in fact a question of\nfact that was not contested in the proceedings below, and\nin fact --\nQUESTION: Well, all that adds up to the fact\nthat he was not disabled when he reapplied. He wasn't.\nMR. MONTOYA: That is correct.\nQUESTION: And -- and nobody is arguing that he\nwas. He wasn't disabled. So he doesn't fit under the\nstatute --\nMR. MONTOYA: Well --\nQUESTION: -- as a disabled person. He wasn't\nregarded as because he wasn't asked to take a test or\nanything. I mean, he just doesn't fit under the\ndefinition of disability in the statute. So --\nQUESTION: But he had a record of disability,\nwhich makes him disabled within the meaning of the\nstatute.\nMR. MONTOYA: Yes, that is true, Justice\nStevens. And Justice O'Connor, in fact, in George\nMedina's letter, he says that there's a complete lack of\nevidence indicating successful drug rehabilitation,\nindicating that Raytheon believed that he was still\naddicted. And not only does Raytheon say that once in a\nfootnote in its position statement, it also says it again.\nMr. --\nQUESTION: Of course, if he's still addicted,\nthen he's not protected by the act.\nMR. MONTOYA: Well, they -- it's a false belief\nthat they believe he's addicted. And -- and if he's\nregarded as taking drugs and alcohol and is -- and is\ndisabled as a result of that addiction, then he is\nregarded as disabled under the act, which is exactly what\nRaytheon said in writing in its first official statement\nregarding this case.\nQUESTION: Mr. Montoya, in your -- you say now\nthat you question the existence of such a rule, and yet\nyou've had an opportunity for discovery in the district\ncourt and you didn't try to pursue any kind of disparate\nimpact. I -- I don't see that you ever asked any\nquestions about, well, let's look at this rule. Do you\napply it to people who were let go for stealing or\nwhatever other reasons? You never, never tested the rule.\nMR. MONTOYA: Your Honor, the rule was tested in\nthe context of the deposition examination of the only two\nwitnesses that Raytheon produced who testified about the\nrule: Bockmiller and Medina.\nAnd, first of all, no one knew the genesis of\nthe rule where -- or -- or not -- they didn't even\ndescribe it as a rule. In the depositions, they described\nit as a practice, and they didn't know the origin of the\npractice. They didn't know how often it had been applied.\nThey didn't know why it hadn't been written down.\nAnd moreover and -- and very importantly, this\noral practice contradicted Raytheon's written practices.\nFor example, under Raytheon's written rules, a temporary\nemployee who tests positive for drugs and alcohol, quote,\nwill have their assignment terminated and will not be\neligible for assignment or for regular employment for the\nsucceeding 12 months.\nis actually contrary to its alleged oral practice, which\nimpeaches the testimony regarding the existence of the\nwritten rule. If a temporary employee tests positive for\ndrugs and alcohol, the temporary employee is terminated,\nbut can reapply even for permanent employment -- temporary\nor permanent employment within 12 months. That impeaches\nthe very existence of the alleged oral practice. In\nfact --\nQUESTION: I still don't understand why you\ndidn't follow up those two depositions with\ninterrogatories, saying what is the origin of this\npractice. How long have you had it? To whom have you\napplied it? The company certainly would have records of\nthe people that they've discharged for cause, how many of\nthem had applied to be re-hired.\nMR. MONTOYA: That's true, Justice Ginsburg.\nHowever, that's a two-edged sword. Raytheon also didn't\nadduce any evidence of its application to any other\nindividual and that would actually be Raytheon's burden.\nIf we, as the Ninth Circuit concluded, established a prima\nfacie case, then it's Raytheon's duty to rebut that prima\nfacie case with some form of evidence. The only evidence\nthat Raytheon produced in reference to this oral practice\nwas the testimony of Bockmiller and Medina, and they\ndidn't adduce any applications of this rule either. So if\nyou look at the totality of evidence, actually that\ndeficit in the record cuts against Raytheon and in favor\nof Mr. Hernandez.\nQUESTION: Mr. Montoya, I -- I hope -- you don't\nhave much time left. I hope you will -- just give me an\nanswer to the only question in this case that I care\nabout. And I don't care about all these factual\ncontroversies. They can be sorted out later.\nWhat is your response to the question of whether\n-- assuming that this company fired your client -- or\nrefused to rehire your client because he had been fired\nfor misconduct. Okay? It has a right to do that, and --\nand it is not a -- an instance of disparate treatment.\nWhat is your response?\nMR. MONTOYA: Your --\nQUESTION: Is it anything other than the -- the\nneed for accommodating a disability? Is -- is that the\nonly reason why it is unlawful?\nMR. MONTOYA: No, that's not the only reason.\nIf -- if I understand your question, Justice Scalia, it's\nnot only a question of reasonable accommodation, it's also\na question of whether or not he's the most qualified.\nIt's also a question of whether or not he constitutes a\ndirect threat or his rehiring would give rise to an undue\nhardship or was justified by a business necessity.\nQUESTION: But that's -- that's all -- those are\nall categories under the need to accommodate. Right?\nMR. MONTOYA: Yes, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: Apart -- apart -- assuming that --\nassuming that I don't think that issue was raised in the\ncase, is there any other reason why it would have been\nunlawful, assuming that they were simply implementing a\npolicy?\nMR. MONTOYA: Yes, Your Honor. Based upon\n12(b)(6), the screen out or tend to screen out, this\nscreened out this particular individual, and in that\nrespect, Justice Scalia, I believe that this case is very\nanalogous to the Court's opinion in PGA v. Martin where\nyou have a uniform rule that someone claims is not subject\nto any exception. I think that this rule violates the\nADA, as the Ninth Circuit concluded because this rule is\nthe antithesis of a particularized inquiry that the case\nlaw demands a disabled applicant or a disabled employee\nreceive under the Americans with Disability Act.\nIf Your Honors have no further questions, I'll\nthank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Montoya.\nMr. Phillips, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIt seems to me that there are two ways to look\nat this case. One is you can simply take the court of\nappeals at its word, which is to say we think there's a\nquestion for -- that -- that defeats summary judgment on a\nprima facie case, but when we get to the question of what\nthe policy is of the -- of the employer in this case,\nthere's no dispute about that, the employer's policy was\napplied, and then address the question of whether or not\nthat policy is valid under the ADA.\nI have not heard Mr. Montoya yet attempt to\ndefend that -- that holding in the face of a disparate\ntreatment theory in this case. He puts in disparate\nimpact under 12(b)(6). He puts in reasonable\naccommodation, 112(b)(6) and 112(b)(5). Those are not\nissues that were decided below. They were not the theory\nof the court of appeals.\nThis is a decision that has extraordinary\nimplications because thousands of employers have precisely\nthis rule. It is important for this Court to declare that\nthat rule is valid.\nOn the secondary question -- and that is, can\nthe Court get to that question? I think there's no doubt\nthat the Court ought to just follow the court of appeals'\nlogic on that. But if the Court wanted to look at whether\nor not there is a question of fact as to whether or not\nthis person was discriminated against because of his\ndisability, I submit to you that the record does not\npermit a jury to make that finding under this Court's\ndecision in Reeves.\nBockmiller was the decision maker. She\ntestified, without contradiction, that she never looked\npast the summary sheet that said he was discharged because\nof conduct, and that was it. And she didn't have to look\nbeyond that.\nMedina testified, without contradiction, that\nthat is the policy that applies. She applied it in the\nright way. We do it consistently. It would have made no\ndifference whether he was a thief or whether he was\nsomebody who used drugs. We applied it that way.\nMr. Montoya and his client had 2 years to\ndiscover whether that policy existed, whether it had\nexceptions, whether it was applied in any other particular\nway, and there is not one shred of evidence -- he didn't\neven ask those witnesses if there were flaws in the way\nthey applied it. That is absolutely across the board.\nThe only -- and -- and then, you know, this is a\npolicy that exists. Thousands of employers use precisely\nthis policy, which is why frankly it probably isn't\nwritten down.\nAnd so at the end of the day, there is nothing\non the other side of this except the one statement that\nwas sufficient to justify getting beyond the prima facie\nstage of this case, but that is not sufficient to justify\ntaking this to a conclusion or to raise an issue of fact\nas to whether or not he was discriminated against because\nof his disability. He was acted against because he\nviolated the company policy. That policy is valid under\nthe ADA, at least as it's been litigated at this point,\nand for that reason the Court should reverse and enter\njudgment in our favor.\nIf there are no other questions, thank you, Your\nHonors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nPhillips.\n"
