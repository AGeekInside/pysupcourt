        "content": "[10:02 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in case 06-134, The Permanent Mission\nof India to the United Nations et al. vs. The City of\nNew York.\nMr. Howley.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J.P. HOWLEY,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. HOWLEY: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court.\nThese are tax enforcement lawsuits. If\njurisdiction existed, the only issue a court would\ndecide is whether a tax is owed. This type of case did\nnot fall within any real property exception to sovereign\nimmunity before Congress passed the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act and Section 1605(a)(4) of that act did\nnot create a new exception where none had otherwise\nexisted. Congress chose --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course you could say the\nsame thing if the mission here sold its property to\nsomeone and someone was claiming the right to possess\nthe property by reason of the sale. And you could come\nup and say this is simply, simply a case deciding the,\nthe ultimate issue of whether the sale occurred or not.\nMR. HOWLEY: Uh --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it would clearly come\nwithin the property right exception, wouldn't it? You\n-- you don't go one step back to look at the transaction\nthat created the, the right in real property assuming\nthe right in real property exists.\nMR. HOWLEY: Actually, Justice Scalia, I\nbelieve that if you had a dispute over what happened\nwith the sale of property that it would fall within the\nbased upon commercial activities exception in\n1605(a)(2).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's assume that, let's\nassume that exception didn't exist.\nMR. HOWLEY: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you had nothing but the\nreal estate exception. You would come in and say this\nultimately relates to not who owns the real estate but\nwhether there was a proper contract or not. And I --\nfrankly we wouldn't accept that.\nMR. HOWLEY: No. And I think that's a very\ndifferent case from what we have here because in that\ncase the issue for the Court to decide is which of the\nparties has the right, has the title in the real\nproperty. That is not in issue here. The City of New\nYork does not seek title in this property. Their action\nis to declare the validity of a tax lien and the issue\nin an action to declare the validity of a tax lien is\nwhether the tax is owed and whether it has been paid.\nThat is the issue that's presented to the Court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what New York is\nseeking is an interest in land and a lien is an interest\nin the land. It runs with the land, doesn't it?\nMR. HOWLEY: I -- I -- yes. I acknowledge\nthat there are some similarities between a lien and a\nright in property. For example, that it runs with the\nland. But there are dissimilarities that are far more\nnumerous and far more significant. Unlike rights and\nproperty a lien does not give the lien holder any right\nto own, access, possess, cross over, collect rents from,\nexclude or any other right in the property.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can't he force a sale of\nthe property to collect the lien?\nMR. HOWLEY: This action does not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that this\naction does not because of the sovereign immunity. But\n-- but we are talking about what the nature of a lien\nis. In an ordinary case cannot a lien holder force a\nsale of the property so that he can get out the money\nrepresented by his lien?\nMR. HOWLEY: Yes. If the lien holder\ncommences an action to foreclose on the property, then a\nconsequence of that could be the sale of the property.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, how can he commence\nan action to foreclose on the property unless he in any\nordinary sense of the term has an interest in the\nproperty?\nMR. HOWLEY: I do not dispute that a lien\nholder has an interest, a security interest in the\nproperty. But Congress did not write in Section\n1605(a)(4) all interests that are in issue in property.\nCongress in fact had the European Convention in front of\nit which said rights, interests and obligations in\nproperty. Congress chose language from the European\nConvention elsewhere but did not choose that language\nhere. Congress said only rights in property.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're distinguishing\nbetween rights in property and interests in property? I\nwould think that every right in property is an interest\nin property and vice versa.\nMR. HOWLEY: No. I do not believe so,\nJustice Scalia. There -- there -- there has to be a\nreason why Congress chose language verbatim from the\nEuropean Convention in other sections of the statute\nsuch as the counterclaim exception, but in this\nexception said we are not taking interest and\nobligations from the European Convention, we are only\nsaying rights. And this Court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The counterclaim sounds\nto me very much like it comes straight out of the\nFederal Rules, not out of any convention. It's the same\ntransaction and occurrence, right?\nMR. HOWLEY: Yes. Yes. The, the\ncounterclaim exception --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's exactly what\nit says in the Federal Rules about compulsory --\nMR. HOWLEY: Yes, but Congress said, in the\nHouse report Congress refers to the European Convention\nas the source for the counterclaim exception in the\nForeign Sovereign Immunities Act so Congress said we are\ntaking this from the European Convention. This -- this\nlanguage also --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Congress didn't really say\nit. I mean the committee said it to be precise.\nMR. HOWLEY: Yes, that's absolutely correct,\nJustice.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Good.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What was your distinction\nbetween a mortgage and a tax lien?\nMR. HOWLEY: I don't think there is a\ndistinguished, a distinction between a mortgage and a\ntax lien.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, so think they can't\nenforce mortgage under this? That is to say the bank\ncan't; it's not an interest of property in mortgage?\nMR. HOWLEY: No. But Congress, Congress\npassed another exception here, 1605(a)(2) that said\nactions based upon commercial activity provide an\nexception to sovereign immunity and these exceptions\nhave to be read together. They have to be read --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's, that's where it's\nhard for me because a purchase money mortgage, you sell\nthe real estate. Ordinary secured interest in mortgage\nis secured interest by a lender is normally viewed as an\ninterest in property, I think. I mean is there, is\nthere any law anywhere that says that isn't an interest\nin property?\nMR. HOWLEY: Well, actually there is. In\nthe, in -- when the United States waived immunity from\nsuit concerning real property it limited its waivers to\nliens and mortgages and not rights in property. And so\nthere has been distinctions made between mortgage liens\nand liens on the one hand and rights in property on the\nother.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on that point in\nsome jurisdictions and perhaps you can tell me about New\nYork, I had thought and correct me if I'm wrong, that\ntax liens have a superior status to other liens in that\nthey are an, an interest or an estate in the property as\nopposed to an attachment.\nIs it not true? And I don't, and I'm not\ntalking just about order of priority for creditors. I'm\ntalking about the superiority insofar as being or not\nbeing an interest in property.\nMR. HOWLEY: Well, yes. It is superior to\nother types of liens.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. HOWLEY: It is an interest, a security\ninterest in the property, but it is not a right in the\nestate of the property, and it doesn't give any type of\nthe possession and ownership rights that every other\nright in property gives.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there New York law to\nthat effect?\nMR. HOWLEY: Yes, there is. And we have\ncited it in our brief. The Respondent has attempted to\ndistinguish it, because a Court of Claims jurisdictional\nact was passed that deemed a lien an interest in\nproperty for purposes of jurisdiction in the New York\nCourt of Claims but the essential nature of a lien is\nnot, under New York law, a right in the estate.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because I had -- I had\nthought that it is an estate in land in at least some\njurisdictions. And Justice Breyer was asking about the\nsame thing. In other words, there are liens -- there\nare liens and liens. There are different kinds of\nliens.\nMR. HOWLEY: There appears to be in\ndifferent jurisdictions, different treatments of liens.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that brings up\nthe basic question I have, is this a question of State\nlaw or Federal law?\nMR. HOWLEY: This is a question of Federal\nlaw. This Court has held --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So even if you have\ndifferent rules in different States, there is going to\nbe one rule under Federal law under 1605(a)(4)?\nMR. HOWLEY: Yes, that is correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice. And this Court held in Saudi Arabia against\nNelson and Argentina against Weltover that the exception\nlanguage -- they are dealing with the commercial\nactivities exception -- must have the meaning that\nCongress understood the restrictive theory of sovereign\nimmunity to require at the time it passed the statute.\nAnd so when defining what a right in\nimmovable property in issue means, we have to give that\nthe meaning that the restrictive theory of sovereign\nimmunity required at the time in 1976. And in 1976, no\ncourt here in the United States or anywhere in the world\nhad held that sovereign immunity was abrogated merely by\nhaving a statutory lien on the property.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Had the State Department\ntaken a position at that point, at the time the Act was\npassed?\nMR. HOWLEY: There is -- not to my\nknowledge. There is vague language in the testimony in\nthe House report, general language about 1605(a)(4)\nrelating to real property disputes, but there is not\nprecise language about whether liens are or liens are\nnot --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was nothing vague\nabout the State Department's brief in the Englewood\ncase.\nMR. HOWLEY: No, there is not, Justice\nGinsburg. But they lost in Englewood. They lost and\nthe Englewood Court relied on a D.C. Circuit decision.\nAnd I believe that the Solicitor General will say that\nthey have reconsidered their position, they have\nreconsidered Article 29 of the European Convention,\nwhich they relied on heavily in the Englewood brief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But anyway, at a time\ncloser to the passage of the Act, the State Department\nwas taking the position that a lien was an interest in\nland.\nMR. HOWLEY: Yes, that is correct. But they\nhave since decided that that position was wrong.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they just may\nbe more sympathetic to India and Mongolia than they were\nto Libya.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not beyond the realm\nof the conceivable, is it?\nMR. HOWLEY: It's not beyond the realm of\nthe conceivable.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I take it there has\nnever been a case in the history of the world you'll\ntell me where a lender or bank or anybody who loaned\nmoney to build an embassy has ever brought a case\nagainst the owner of the embassy, the sovereign, and won\nunder anything like this exception, because they can't\nsue them.\nMR. HOWLEY: Not that we're aware of, and\nnot that we've seen --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ever. And there is none\nthe other way, where they said you couldn't sue them.\nMR. HOWLEY: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So why do people\nlend money to build embassies?\nMR. HOWLEY: Well, because once you lend\nmoney and you engage in commercial activity, if the\nclaim is based upon the commercial activity, Congress\nhad provided a separate section, 1605(a)(2) that\nprotects the American citizen who has lent money to an\nembassy.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And how did it work before\n1605 was passed, how did they used to build, in the 19th\ncentury, embassies, if you know.\nMR. HOWLEY: I don't know about 19th century\nembassies. I do know that since the Tate letter, which\npredates the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, there has\nbeen a commercial activity exception here in the United\nStates.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't buying land that\nyou're not using for your embassy itself, or for the\nresidence of the ambassador, but buying and occupying\nthat land which subjects yourself to real estate taxes\non that land, why isn't that a commercial activity?\nMR. HOWLEY: Well, this Court held in Saudi\nArabia against Nelson that it's not just engaged in,\nrelated to commercial activity, but the cause of action,\nthe claim has to be based upon commercial activity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the Indian embassy could\nown real estate throughout New York City, which it\nwouldn't have to pay taxes on? Or if it didn't, nothing\ncould be done about it?\nMR. HOWLEY: It depends on the use they put\nthat property to.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? No. You're saying,\nyou're saying it's not a commercial activity. I mean --\nMR. HOWLEY: The mere ownership of the land\nis not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It depends upon the use,\nand the use in this case is not -- is not the embassy\nitself or the residence of the ambassador. I mean, they\ncould use a piece of property for anything.\nMR. HOWLEY: As long as it's not commercial\nactivity, it would not be taxed and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the buying and\noccupying of it is commercial activity.\nMR. HOWLEY: Well, the buying of it, if the\nclaim is based upon the buying of the property, under\nSaudi Arabia against Nelson, then the commercial\nactivities exception would apply. But the mere\nownership of the property is not commercial activity.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't it commercial\nactivity for New York to say, we provide garbage\nservices, electric services, et cetera.\nMR. HOWLEY: Well, separate and apart from\nthe jurisdictional issue, the Vienna Conventions do say\nthat if there are fees for services provided, such as\ngarbage collection, water, those types of services, then\nthere is no immunity from the fees for those services.\nAnd those fees should be paid. The separate issue of\nwhether that's commercial activity, it may be. It\ndoesn't matter whether the city provides a service such\nas water, or a private entity provides a service such as\nwater. That may be commercial activity.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But they pay fees and New\nYork taxes. Suppose New York doesn't have fees.\nSuppose they say, we'll just do this out of our property\ntax.\nMR. HOWLEY: Well, no, that does not -- on\nthe substantive issue of whether it's immune under the\nForeign -- under the Vienna Conventions, a tax is\nimmune. They are immune from a tax, but they're not\nimmune for a fee for service. That is how the Vienna\nConventions --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And in reality, you will\nnever get there, because the Vienna Convention deals\nwith the substantive liability -- you're talking about\njurisdiction. On your theory, you would never get to\nthe fee for picking up the garbage, because you wouldn't\nhave any jurisdiction.\nMR. HOWLEY: No, Justice Ginsburg, not at\nall. That's not my position. Let me make my position\nclear. If there is a fee for service provided, such as\ngarbage collection, or provision of water, that would\nfall under the commercial activities exception. But if\nthere is a tax, unless the activity at issue and the\ncause of action at issue is based upon the commercial\nactivity, there is no jurisdiction. This does not mean\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The commercial activity,\nit's applied to that same building that you say can't\nbe -- it can't be any suit for taxes.\nMR. HOWLEY: Yes. There cannot be a suit\nfor taxes. There could be a suit for specific fees for\nservices rendered. But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even -- even if this, the\nbuilding were only the mission and the representative,\nthe minister to the U.N., even then --\nMR. HOWLEY: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the water of a\nmunicipal service, garbage collection, could be charged.\nMR. BAKER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, just as\nif the Indian mission went out to a private water\ncompany and said, please supply me with water, the\nprivate water company could sue, based on commercial\nactivity, to collect for the water it had provided. It\ndoesn't matter if it's the city.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it's the city. Not\na private company, the city itself.\nMR. HOWLEY: The nature of the activity\ndoesn't change just because it's the city providing the\nwater as opposed to a private entity providing the\nwater. We have to look at the nature of the activity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, this isn't a\nsuit for the taxes. I mean, we are not talking about a\nsuit for the taxes.\nMR. HOWLEY: We are here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We are talking about a\ndeclaration as to the interest in the land.\nMR. HOWLEY: No. No, Justice Scalia.\nAbsolutely not. Joint Appendix page 78 is the city's\namended complaint. And even in their foreclosure claim,\neven in their foreclosure claim, what they ask is for a\njudgment of foreclosure directing that the Defendant pay\nthe amount of taxes, interest and other charges due.\nThey are not asking for an interest in the property.\nAll this case is about is money. It's not\nabout rights in the property. And there is a very big\nproblem with allowing a claim for money to become a\nright in property merely by having a local law passed\nthat converts the claim into a lien. The City of New\nYork tomorrow could pass a law that said, if you don't\npay your parking tickets, that is automatically\nconverted into a lien on the property. And then while\nwe can't sue you for the parking tickets, we have\ncreated a right in your property.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You could easily say\nthere has to be a relationship to the property itself.\nMR. HOWLEY: Well, that's not -- that's not\nwhat the City's position is. The City's position is a\nlien is an interest in property and falls within the\nstatute. And Congress didn't write in the statute\narising out of, related to. It said, rights in the\nproperty are an issue. So if under the City's theory,\nif they passed a lien law tomorrow converting all\nparking tickets into liens on property, then their\nposition is they could sue us for parking tickets. And\nif there are no further questions, I will reserve the\nrest of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Howley.\nMr. Srinivasan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nAn action to determine whether property\ntaxes are owed is not a case in which rights of\nimmovable property are an issue, and it's not\ntransformed into such a case by attaching a lien, and\nrecharacterizing the case as one to determine the\nvalidity of the lien.\nAnd I'd like to begin by picking up, Justice\nGinsburg, on the question you just asked, because I\nthink it's very important to emphasize that under\nRespondent's lien-based theory, that theory has the\npotential largely to eviscerate the other exceptions in\nthe FSIA in the following sense: Respondent's theory\ndoesn't turn in any way on the nature or source of the\ndebt that's secured by the lien.\nSo under Respondent's view, the fact that\nthis case involves a debt that arises out of property\ntaxes is largely beside the point. The load bearing\nweight of that theory rests entirely on the supposed\neffects of the lien on the property. And so for\nexample, you could have a case in which a commercial\nactivity is brought into play, where the plaintiff sues\na foreign sovereign for commercial activity that occurs\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's always brought up to\nanswer the problem, well, you know -- let me give you a\ncase in which it obviously is not a commercial activity,\nbut it seems to me that the -- that the lien interest\nhas to be honored. Let's suppose that there is an\nAmerican who is very friendly to and sympathetic with\nthe Indian government, and gives them real estate, not a\ncommercial activity, he gives them real estate in which\nto house the employees in -- in their mission.\nHowever, he retains an interest in that real\nestate. He retains a lien on the real estate, to have\nmoney paid to him at some point. He is not willing to\ngive the full amount of the property, but most of it.\nAnd he retains a lien. Now, under your theory, that\nlien would not be enforceable, is that right?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, the lien wouldn't\nconstitute a right in the property, and that's\nconsistent with what -- the way this Court has always\ndescribed liens. As we point out in pages 21 and 22 of\nour brief, the Court has said --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Enforceable or not.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: The lien would not be\nenforceable against a foreign sovereign, because -- at\nleast with respect to the immovable property.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That seems very strange to\nme.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: We are only talking about\nthe immovable property exception. And with respect to\nthat exception, this Court has expounded that a lien on\nland constitutes no property or right in the land\nitself. And it said that on more than one occasion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought that the\nDepartment submitted a good brief on this issue, but in\n1985. What do you do with all the arguments -- I'm\nlooking at page 12 of your brief in the Englewood case,\nwhich you argued that these liens were interests in\nproperty. Are those arguments no longer valid?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, we, of course,\nreviewed our position in that case, and we have come to\nthe conclusion that it was incorrect. And in the\nEnglewood case, that argument was the third argument in\nthe brief. The first two arguments in the brief were\nmore along the lines of the Court of Appeals decision.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what about the\nargument that it was an interest in property. The brief\nwas very clear that it is an interest in property, and\nthat a tax lien is almost sui generis, in that it is an\nestate in the property.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I don't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It survives bona fide --\nit survives bona fide purchaser without notice?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The other reasons\nyou gave, the holder of a lien can bring an action to\nenjoin waste, holders of liens are entitled to\ncompensation if eminent domain is exercised. All of\nthose reasons are still as valid as they were in 1985.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, let me try to take up\nsome of those in order. First with respect to the\nquestion of whether holders of a lien are entitled to\ncompensation in eminent domain, we don't take issue with\nthe proposition that a lien is property. A lien is\nproperty, but the question under the statute is whether\na lien confers a right in the underlying immovable\nproperty. And so in an eminent domain proceeding it may\njust be that just compensation is owed to a lien holder\nbecause to the extent that the eminent domain proceeding\ntakes that lien there's compensation owed for that\nproperty. But that doesn't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What property is it a right\nin if not the immovable property?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it follows that\nimmovable property and when the immovable property\ndisappears the lien disappears. You know, if it's blown\naway or flooded, it's now in the Atlantic; the lien is\ngone.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA : But otherwise wherever\nthe property goes the lien follows it. How can you say\nthat that's not an interest in the property?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't think it's a\nright in property, Justice Scalia. The lien is a\nspecies of property, of intangible personal property, in\nthe same sense that a cause of action would be, because\nafter all what a lien is is essentially at bottom a\nclaim.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how can the,\nhow can the lien holder then bring an action to enjoin\nwaste of the immovable property?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, a lien holder can\nbring an action to enjoin waste, but it's important to\nunderstand what interest the lien holder is protecting\nin that situation. An action for waste by a lien holder\nis to protect the security interest. It's different\nfrom an action for waste by someone who holds a right in\nthe property. And New York law appears to recognize\nthis because New York I think has two species of waste\nactions, one brought by a security interest holder and\none brought by the holder of property rights. There's a\ncase, Travelers Insurance, in which the Second Circuit\nreviewed New York law in this matter -- it's at 14 F.3d\n114 -- and describes how there's two species of waste\nactions depending on which sort of plaintiff you have in\nissue. And that recognizes that the interest, if you\nwill, that a lien holder has in the property, is\ndifferent from a right in the property.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about paragraph 3 just\nafter paragraph 2 in the complaint? Paragraph 3 asks\nthe court to bar and forever foreclose the defendants\nfrom all right, interest, claim, etcetera in the parcel.\nWell, what about that? What they're asking, I just\nheard it. So what's the answer to that? They seem to\nbe saying, we have the right to the parcel, you the\ndefendant have no right to the parcel.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't -- you'd have\nto ask Respondent's counsel exactly what they mean by\nthat.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I did in part, so he\ncan answer.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Because Respondents have\nrepeatedly indicated in this case and in the court of\nappeals and in this Court that they can't foreclose on\nthe property and so they've abandoned any claim for\nforeclosure. And a foreclosure action wouldn't result\nin the property being deeded to Respondent. It would be\nput up for sale and a third party would purchase it. So\nI'm not -- I can't tell you exactly what that paragraph\nmeans.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In a very practical way,\nyou're expressing that right means ownership means\nownership. But the title is certainly impaired by this\nlien. India could not turn around and sell it to anyone\nwithout doing something to discharge the, lien right?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So the title is certainly\nclouded by this lien.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think liens\ngenerally constitute clouds on title, but the fact that\nsomething's a cloud on title doesn't make it a right in\nthe property. And I could give you one other example.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't have to be a\nright in the property. If you look at it from the\nowner's point of view, it is a cloud on the owner's\ntitle in the property. It affects the owner's title.\nEven if you assert that it doesn't give any title to the\nlien holder, it impairs the title of the property owner.\nAnd that's all that's required, as I read the title, in\nwhich rights in immovable property are an issue, and\nhere the question is whether the, the mission's right to\nthe property is, is impaired by this lien.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I think our arguments apply\nequally both to the lien holder and to the property\nowner, Justice Scalia, in the following sense, that with\nrespect to both of them a lien -- the lien doesn't\naffect rights of possession, it doesn't affect the right\nto exclude others, which this Court has characterized as\nthe most fundamental of property rights. It doesn't\naffect the right to receive income from the property.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It affects the right to\nconvey the property free and clear, which is an enormous\nright that goes along with the real estate.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it has a practical\nconsequence on conveyance because it, as Justice\nGinsburg said, amounts to a cloud on title. But there\nare other instruments that result in a cloud on title\nbut that wouldn't be considered rights in property. One\nexample would be a contract, a purchase option contract\nto purchase property. The holder of a purchase option\nwouldn't be considered to have a right in the property\nunless and until the option was exercised. At least\nthat's the general rule, even though the purchase\ncontract in a sense constitutes a cloud on the title in\nthe same way that a lien might constitute a lien on the\ntitle.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How long did the United\nStates take the opposite position and when did it\nchange?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How long did the United\nStates adhere to the position that's reflect in the\nEnglewood brief and when did it change?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I'm not aware that we\ntook the position before the Englewood brief, so I think\nthat would be 1985. And I don't think we've had\noccasion to revisit that position until this case.\nAnd let me point out with respect to the\nEnglewood brief, the first two points made in that brief\nwere along the lines of the court of appeals reasoning\nin this case, which was to the effect that a statute\nthat refers to a right in immovable property encompasses\nobligations arising out of immovable property. And\nRespondent doesn't attempt to defend that position, but\nthat's the predicate on which our Englewood brief\nrested. And so we think there's good cause for us to\nrevisit our position from that case.\nNow, with respect to the question of whether\na lien establishes rights in property, which is now the\nfocus of Respondent's argument, I would point out that\nin other areas of the law the Court has looked to\nquestions concerning whether there is a right to exclude\nothers, whether there is a right to obtain income from\nthe property, whether there is a right to assert\npossession of the property. That's, for example, the\ntypes of considerations this Court takes into account in\nthe tax area in assessing whether a Federal tax lien can\nattach to a property by virtue of the fact that there is\na right to property at stake. And we think the same\nsorts of consideration should inform the Court's\nassessment of the immovable property exception in this\ncase.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about an easement?\nThat doesn't involve any of those things. You can't\nexclude people and so forth.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, an easement I think\nwould qualify as a right in property because at least\nyour standard easement would provide a right of access\nto the property by a thoroughfare. And so both sides\nwould be affected in their use of the property in that\nsense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Cardozo.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARDOZO\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. CARDOZO: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nThere are three reasons this case puts in\nissue rights in immovable property: First, the plain\nlanguage of the statute; second, the statute's purpose\nand legislative history; and third, international\npractice as it existed in 1976.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Cardozo, before you go\nany further, I had been under the impression from your\nbrief that you're not trying to enforce anything\nagainst, against India or against the mission. You just\nsaid you wanted a declaratory judgment that the lien is\na valid lien. But, but here it is in your complaint\nyou're asking for foreclosure. Which, which is it?\nMR. CARDOZO: Justice Scalia, we know that\nSection 1610 would preclude us from actually\nforeclosing. We're not allowed to do that. There's no\nquestion about that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You just asked for it to\nscare them? Was that it?\nMR. CARDOZO: No. We do want, as the\ndiscussion preceding me highlighted, we do want to get\nin and take what we think is, as a practical matter, is\nour property. But we can't. We understand that. So\nwhat we're, what we're saying in our complaint in\nparagraph 3, as Justice Breyer pointed out, is we would\nlike to bar them from holding title. But as we quickly\nconceded as soon as we filed the action, we can't\nforeclose because of the provisions of Section 1610.\nBut it doesn't mean that the fact that we can't\nforeclose doesn't mean that we don't have a right in\nproperty. Let me give you a very good illustration. If\nthere is a possessory dispute, someone, an embassy,\nrented premises and agreed that if they didn't pay the\nrent they would lose their ability to continue to occupy\nthe premises and they failed to pay rent, that's a title\ndispute. The person who rented the property would bring\na suit saying: I have a right to get back into my\nproperty and there is clearly a right in property in\nSection 1605. I can't believe that Congress said, that\nCongress intended to say, well, you can bring an action\nfor nonpayment of rent and seek possession except for\n1610, that's okay. There's jurisdiction in an action\nfor rent, but if you want possession of property because\nyou haven't paid your taxes, and of course you still\ncan't foreclose, there's no jurisdiction. That doesn't\nmake any sense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but they'll say as\nwas their response to a lot of hypotheticals, the\ncommercial act exception covers that.\nMR. CARDOZO: Your Honor, it may or may not\ncover the commercial act exception. And going back to a\nquestion that Justice Breyer asked, there are, there are\ncases, not in the United States, but -- and we're citing\nsome of them in footnote 24 in the red brief -- that\nwhen someone, not the commercial property exception,\nsomeone lent money to, to build an embassy and they\ndefaulted on the mortgage, the German court said\njurisdiction. It's not a question of enforcement, but\njurisdiction.\nThe reason for this is if you first look at\nthe language of the statute, the language of the statute\ndoesn't say only certain kinds of rights. It says all\nrights in property if they're in issue.\nWe believe that we have a right in the\nIndian and Mongolia premises. We --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The problem that actually\nis bothering me with your side of the case which I find\ndifficult is, suppose I accept this principle that you\nhave. All right, it seems to me anything at all can be\nreduced to a lien, any judgment, at least certainly slip\nand fall cases and you didn't keep the ice up in front\nand I want $4 million damages plus 300 million in\npunitives and where it is I have a lien against the\nembassy here. And I can't think of a distinction once I\ngo down your road. I mean, he at least has an absolute\ndistinction which I can see, but once I go down your\nroad where is the stopping place? What's the principle?\nMR. ROBERTS: Let me try, Justice Breyer.\nFirst of all, if there was a judgment on that\nhypothetical tort action that you just mentioned, if\nthere were a judgment you wouldn't have gotten the\njudgment in the first place unless you had originally\ncome within --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm imagining a city or\nBelarus or someplace where what they do is they say slip\nand fall on ice -- you know, you get a lien against the\nproperty prior to -- okay. I mean, it's easy to imagine\nthat kind of thing.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And in a range of subject\nmatters. So I'm looking to what the stopping place is\nonce I start down your road.\nMR. ROBERTS: And the stopping place I think\nis a Federalism concept and a due process concept,\nbecause as this Court has held in a number of cases,\nthere's a real due process question if liens are created\nwith no concern about the effect on the defendant. You\nhave to take a look at the interest of the so-called\nplaintiff and you have to find whether there is a\nrelationship between the lien and the underlying claim.\nNow --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't you just say --\nyou know, if you're worried about the malevolence of\ncountries to make all sorts of stuff liens, I guess if\nthey're malevolent enough they can make all sorts of\nstuff easements, which, which the other side says is\nundoubtedly a property interest. So they could say\nthat, you know, if you're held liable the court can give\nyou an easement over the property of, of the defendant\nworth so much money. And that would undoubtedly be\nenforceable.\nMR. CARDOZO: Justice Scalia, they did say\nthat and certainly if an easement is a right in\nproperty, either because of the hypothetical you just\ngave or a traditional easement, there is nothing\ndifferent with a tax lien. In fact, a tax lien is a\nmuch greater interest.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I still have my question\nbecause I'm not world about malevolence, is that I don't\ncarry around in my head all of the possible things that\nmight be liens against property. And so maybe my\nimagination is wrong, but I want to know are you are\narguing that every lien against the property is in fact\na right in property which allows a lawsuit, or are you\narguing that there is some distinction between some and\nthe other. And I noticed that the Restatements and\nothers are trying to distinguish between whether the\nlien in question grows out of the property or it doesn't\ngrow out of the property, which I find possibly hard to\nwork with and so I want to know how you see it.\nMR. CARDOZO: And what I see, Justice\nBreyer, is when you take a look at the cases in this\nCourt such as Connecticut against Doehr and the other\ncases which put limits, the constitutional limits on\nliens, of course if a State passed a statute that runs\nafoul of the various due process concerns that this\nCourt has articulated that is certainly one check that\nwe have.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's take the\nparking ticket that your colleague raised, that New York\nwould make a parking ticket a lien, unpaid parking\nticket a lien on all, all property.\nMR. CARDOZO: Justice Ginsburg, I think that\nwould be a hard question, but if it does not run afoul\nof the constitutional concerns that I just articulated\nand it was a lien applicable not just of course to\nforeign sovereigns, but to any unpaid parking ticket --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, yes.\nMR. CARDOZO: -- I think that then that\nwould come within the immovable property exception.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So the only thing they\nwould have to do I suppose -- you've mentioned the due\nprocess point -- would be to perhaps give a hearing\nbefore the lien was declared and that would be enough?\nMR. CARDOZO: I think, I think it certainly\nwould, Justice Souter, if in fact there was a hearing.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, provided that,\nprovided notice of hearing was offered, the parking\nticket lien would be in the same position as this lien,\nright -- the hearing.\nMR. CARDOZO: I think that's right. I think\nthat's right. And so --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And under New York law\ndoes property, do property tax liens have some superior\nstatus? Are they distinct under New York law from other\nliens?\nMR. CARDOZO: Well, they're -- as tax liens\nyou may get into a priority fight in a bankruptcy\ncontext.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Without reference to\npriority.\nMR. CARDOZO: I don't believe that they\nwould have any different lien, any different status,\nalthough my colleague corrects me and says that yes, tax\nliens -- tax liens do have in certain circumstances a\ngreater priority. It's hard to think through exactly\nwhere that issue would be.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I had thought they\nhad a greater priority and that they even survived\npurchase from bona fide sellers.\nMR. CARDOZO: That certainly, that is\ncertainly true and a property -- excuse me for\ninterrupting -- a tax lien would run forever with no\ntime limit, for example, whereas a mechanics lien has a\nstatutory time on it. If you got into a dispute about\nthose two liens obviously the tax lien would have --\nwould have priority.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- may I ask\nthis question? Suppose another jurisdiction had a tax\nsystem which was just a little different from New York's\nand didn't provide for a lien until after a suit had\nbeen brought and there had been a failure to pay or had\nto get a judgment first. On that case, that\njurisdiction could not enforce this tax law?\nMR. CARDOZO: That is correct, Justice\nStevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And don't you think it's\nsort of a strange way to define a tax immunity, by --\nby, by describing the -- the interest in immovable\nproperty?\nMR. CARDOZO: Well, we start off with the\nstatutory language and the statutory language says right\nin property. We are not talking about the abstract\nright to tax.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, but the basic issue\nin final analysis is whether they have to pay their\ntaxes, isn't it?\nMR. CARDOZO: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The ultimate issue is\nwhether they have to pay their taxes.\nMR. CARDOZO: The ultimate substance --\nunderlying substantive issue is that but -- and of\ncourse, the State Department even today says these taxes\nshould be paid. But the jurisdictional issue is whether\nthere is a right in property. And so if you just -- if\nyou don't create a lien, if a particular State did not\ncreate a lien, that would not give you the right, which\nis what the statute, statutory language says.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know any States that\ndon't? Isn't it fairly standard? For --\nMR. CARDOZO: I believe -- I believe it is\nfairly standard, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah.\nMR. CARDOZO: I -- there may be one out of\n50 States that, that don't say this. I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May, may I just ask, for a\nkind of a footnote kind of question? I mean you\nreferred again to the text. And if we are going to go\non a very strict reading of the text as I understand it,\nyou don't have to claim a right in property, you have to\nhave a claim in -- in which someone's rights in\nimmovable property are in issue. So whether the, the --\nand so long as you create a cloud on the title, however\nthat cloud is classified, it puts in issue the title of\nthe named title holder, so that the debates about the\ndistinction between a lien and easement and so forth is\nessentially irrelevant as long as it's a cloud on the\ntitle. If we are going to be that, if we are going to\nbe literal, isn't that so?\nMR. CARDOZO: I, I agree with that. And\nhere today the right that India and Mongolia claim in\ntheir property is in issue, because we say you do not\nhave the full right to your property and if this lien\nruns long enough, it's going to wipe out the value of\ntheir property completely. And all the statute, the\nstatute doesn't say as the European Convention says the\nforeign sovereign's right in property. The statute says\neither -- in effect, either side's right in property.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.\nMR. CARDOZO: And I think we can also get a\ngreat deal of help by looking --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the -- the European,\nthe European treaty looks at it from the other side,\nyou're saying. It looks at it from the foreign\nsovereign side.\nMR. CARDOZO: The European Convention\nphrased differently looks at it from both sides, Justice\nScalia, which is why they needed the words obligation.\nIf you look at Article 9 of the European Convention it\nfirst talks about the foreign sovereign's right or\ninterest in property, and then it says \"or the foreign\nsovereign's obligations arising out of that property.\"\nThat's a different phrase than the FSIA which doesn't\nuse the word foreign sovereign; it says \"its\" rights in\nproperty have to be an issue. So you didn't need to\nencompass all the language of the European Convention.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would the obligations\narising out of the property in the European Convention\ninclude the obligation to pay taxes, property taxes?\nMR. CARDOZO: It would include a controversy\nover that absolutely. And let, let me talk about the\ninternational practice because we should take a look at\ninternational practice to -- to guide us.\nWhat was the practice in 1976? Well, first\nof all we know that the restatement second and comment\nin paragraph 68 says disputes over rights or interest in\nproperty. And the restatement third, which was\nconcededly a few years after the 1976 adoption of the\nstatute, makes it perfectly clear. It says it\nexplicitly. But where did the restatement --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This says what explicitly?\nMR. CARDOZO: Says that there is\njurisdiction over tax claim. Section 455 of -- of\nrestatement third.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Over tax liens or\nclaims?\nMR. CARDOZO: Over tax claims. Excuse me,\nChief -- Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you don't go\nthat far.\nMR. CARDOZO: That -- we don't have to go\nthat far because we believe we, as a -- we have a right\nin property arising from the lien. Now let's look at\nthe foreign cases before we get to the European\nConvention and we cite a number of them in footnote 24.\nThere is for example the case I referred to in response\nto Justice Breyer, a suit over a mortgage. A suit over\na mortgage. It's not the commercial exception; a suit\nover a mortgage.\nThere is a case in England in 1975 which\nanalyzes broadly what's the meaning of this real\nproperty exception. And that case in England which we\ncite says a security interest, a suit over security\ninterest for a mortgage, there is jurisdiction within\nthe immovable property exception.\nThere is a large number of cases. You look\nat the Harvard Review of 1932, the status of the law at\nthat time, extensive review of all the relevant cases,\nsays the same thing. Then that brings us to the\nEuropean Convention which was adopted shortly before the\nFSIA and which the State Department told Congress was\nconsistent with the FSIA.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is this the Vienna\nConvention?\nMR. CARDOZO: Pardon me? No, the European\nConvention.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: European Convention.\nMR. CARDOZO: Right. And the European\nConvention in Article 9 as I say has a very broad\nimmovable property exception. I'm not looking just at\nthe language. I'm looking at what does this convention\nreflect as far as international practice was at the\ntime? And that practice at the time as reflected by the\nconvention, as reflected by these cases, all say that\nthere is a very broad immovable property exception that\nshould cover this kind of dispute.\nNow let me make one, one or two final\npoints. If this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the -- the\nconvention used language quite different than that was\nused by Congress. So I'm not quite sure how that\ninternational practice reflected in or arising out of\nthe convention is terribly pertinent.\nMR. CARDOZO: I'm not, Mr. Chief Justice,\nI'm not talking just about the language. I'm talking\nabout the European, the international practice as\nreflected by that convention because the 1976\nlegislative history of the FSIA says we are trying to\nconform United States practice into the, the practice\nthat is followed internationally. And I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And in some cases\nthey used language directly from the convention and in\nthis case they didn't so it seems to me a particularly\nill-advised source for looking for what they were trying\nto do.\nMR. CARDOZO: Then I would say where did\nthey get that source from? And that's where I cite the,\nfirst the international cases themselves which reflect\nas of 1976 the same philosophy reflected by the European\nConvention. There is no question that the wording is\ndifferent. I'm not, I'm not disputing that. What I'm\nsaying is that wording conveys an intent from the\ninternational point of view to have the broad parameters\nof an international, of an immovable property exception\nand that was consistent with the international cases\nthat have been decided at that time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Did their practice draw a\ndistinction between occupied by the ambassador himself\nand property occupied by employees of the embassy?\nMR. CARDOZO: As a substantive matter,\nJustice Stevens, the answer to that question is of\ncourse yes. Because the Vienna convention in Article 20\n-- 23 says that the premises of -- of the mission may\nnot be, may not be taxed. And then you look at Article\n1 to look at what is the meaning of premises of the\nmission and they talk about where the business of the\nmission is conducted, or where the ambassador resides.\nIt doesn't talk about the rest of the employees. And\nsince 1952, the State Department even before the Vienna\nconvention and subsequent has been advising missions in\nNew York, it's on their web site today that they must\npay taxes on staff housing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you what, what do\nyou get out of this case? You've withdrawn your claim\nfor judgment of foreclosure. What are you going to get\nout of it? Declaratory judgment that they owe the\ntaxes? I'm not sure they have ever contested that they\ndon't owe taxes.\nMR. CARDOZO: Oh yes I think if you look, if\nyou look at the Petitioners' brief I think they do\ncontest that they, that they have to pay the tax. But\nwhat we'll get out of this is the following.\nFirst of all, start with the fact that the\nstatute says you can bring an action in this\njurisdiction even if you can't execute. We have the\nState Department telling us, the Solicitor General\ntelling us in their briefs, footnote 17, that countries\npay lawful taxes. So if we can get, if we can proceed\nto judgment and get that, and get that declaration, we\nbelieve based upon what the Solicitor General has said\nthey will pay their taxes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but --\nMR. CARDOZO: In addition --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say he is wrong about a\nlot of other stuff.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you believe him\nabout that?\nMR. CARDOZO: And the -- the reason I\nbelieve him about that is that Congress has passed a law\nthat says if you don't pay your taxes reflected by a\njudgment, whatever the amount of that tax is, you're\ngoing to lose 1110 percent of your foreign aid. And so\nI believe we are going to get a lot out of that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I -- can I can ask you\nto go back for a second to where I'm getting myself into\na muddle here.\nI'm still now being very, very literal. I\nthink you're very literal and you say it says, a case in\nwhich is involved rights to property. And you say, but\nthis is a right to property in this case; if I win this\ncase then I have a right to sell that house. Therefore,\nI have a right in property.\nNow, if that's the reasoning why doesn't\nthat apply to every case where a State might say if you\nwin this case you can sell his house? I mean, I can\neasily imagine a tort case, a contract case where a\nState would say, you win, you can sell their house to\ncollect the judgment.\nMR. CARDOZO: And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I'm still back in a\ndifferent route at where I'm having the problem, which\nis a problem of distinguishing in principle between\neither your absolute principle, \"do it,\" his absolute\nprinciple, \"don't do it,\" or something in the middle.\nMR. CARDOZO: And I think the something in\nthe middle, Justice Breyer, is if you're talking about a\nprejudgment lien which I think is your hypothetical.\nIt's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The hypothetical was doing\naway with the prejudgment lien. I would say the exact\nsame words apply with just as much force if there is no\nprejudgment lien because a suit without a lien the State\nwere to say, you win this tort claim, you can go sell\nthis property to collect the judgment, is a suit in\nwhich there is at issue your right to sell his property,\njust as there is here.\nMR. CARDOZO: But Justice, Justice Breyer,\nin that hypothetical, you don't have a right in property\nuntil you win the case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you?\nMR. CARDOZO: We have, we have a, there is\nan in issue today our right to property and I believe\nthat that is a distinction and I believe also -- and of\ncritical importance.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait a minute. But\nthe -- the embassy has rights in it when the case is\nbrought, even before the final judgment. So you know,\nlet's give the devil his due. It would be a case in\nwhich rights in immovable property are in issue.\nMR. CARDOZO: And if --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You want to look at it from\nthe embassy side too so --\nMR. CARDOZO: Yes. And if you want to look\nat it from the embassy side under my theory, their right\n-- under my lien their rights are an issue today. And\nunder Justice Breyer's hypothetical if it meets the\nother due process concerns which I think under that\nhypothetical would raise a number of interesting ones --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's your big\ndefense. To do that they would have to do it for\neverybody' they would have to do it for Joe Sixpack as\nwell as for the embassy, right?\nMR. CARDOZO: That's right. That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is it only the case that\nthe, that the only instances in which, consistent with\nthe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act the State could say\nyou get the house, would be instances of litigation\narising out of commercial activity?\nMR. CARDOZO: Yes. That is -- that is --\nthat is correct. Because it's only in the commercial\nactivities exception can you execute and then only in\ncertain limited circumstances --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.\nMR. CARDOZO: And you can execute unless the\npremises are not being used for the purposes of the\nmission.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now -- now I take it you\nunder New York law and the law of most jurisdictions,\nthe tax lien becomes a lien against the property before\nany judicial proceedings.\nMR. CARDOZO: That is correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just because they are\nunpaid. And this is probably a question more for them\nthan for you, but as you understand their position, if\nyou put a lien on the property for unpaid taxes, are\nthey entitled to demand its removal?\nMR. CARDOZO: Of course they can. And in\nfact the Republic of Argentina case --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean of course they\ncan under their view?\nMR. CARDOZO: No. They can bring an action\nto quiet title. They can bring an action --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No. No.\nMR. CARDOZO: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE KENNEY: Excuse me.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can they demand that that\nlien be released --\nMR. CARDOZO: They can demand it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no.\n-- because it violates the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act? Is it their position that you have no\nright at all even to notice a lien against the property?\nMR. CARDOZO: Well, I haven't heard their\narticulation of that position, but they certainly could\nwrite --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It would seem to me to\nfollow from what they're saying.\nMR. CARDOZO: I think it may. I think they\ncertainly have a right to ask us to reconsider and make\nthe various arguments on the merits to us. There are\ncases preceding the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act\nwhere a country felt the lien was invalid and brought a\nlawsuit.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My hypothetical is can\nthey demand that the lien be removed solely because of\nthe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.\nMR. CARDOZO: They could demand that, but I\ndon't that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act answers\nthe underlying substantive question. You'd have to look\nat the Vienna Convention as well as New York law to\nanswer that question, because all the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act is talking about is the jurisdictional\nissue, not the substantive issue.\nAnd let me just point out that if we, if we\ncan't bring this lawsuit to have, to try to foreclose or\nat least to have a declaration of our rights, this\nlawsuit can't be brought anywhere. No place in the\nworld can New York City have a conclusion as to who owns\nthis property. That is absolutely inconsistent with the\nunderlying immovable property exception and the local\naction rule, which says that land -- that a sovereign\nhas a prim evil interest in its land, it has the right\nto adjudicate its property.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: With reference to the\noffset of foreign aid, could that offset be made under\nthe controlling statutes just based on your lien, or do\nyou have to have a judgment first?\nMR. CARDOZO: No. The statute talks about a\njudgment. It can't just be that.\nSo finally, even though we cannot execute on\nour property -- on the judgment, it has a major impact,\nthis case has a major impact on what we can do. If we\ncan't do it there's no other place for our problems to\nbe resolved. I urge that the decision below be\naffirmed. Thank you.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you a question in\nyour remaining time. With respect to the statute that\nauthorizes the, the charge against foreign aid, would\nthat statute have any application except either in a\ncommercial case or a case like yours?\nMR. CARDOZO: Theoretically it would have an\napplication in a counterclaim situation as well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. CARDOZO: -- Justice Souter. I think\nthose are the three things. Of course, you don't need\nthat statute for the commercial exception because you\ncan execute.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's right. You can go\ndirectly.\nMR. CARDOZO: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So in practical terms, with\nthe possible exception of a counterclaim, the foreign\naid setoff would simply apply to a case like this, then?\nMR. CARDOZO: That's right. And Justice\nSouter, while certainly the Congress that passed those\nstatutes was not the Congress that passed the FSIA,\nthere is, certainly should be an effort to harmonize\nwhat the Congress has done.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I was going to say, if you\ndeny all the statutes you've got to --\nMR. CARDOZO: That is obviously the way to\nreconcile these statutes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you do with traffic\ntickets? They've built up. You know, there's $100,000\nowing in traffic tickets by some embassy. How do you\nget a judgment that that is owing?\nMR. CARDOZO: You can't get a judgment that\nthat is owing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you can't use even the\nforeign aid gimmick to --\nMR. CARDOZO: Not unless, unless the statute\nis changed, Justice Scalia, which we have from time to\ntime tried to persuade Congress to do.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Foreign aid --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Unless New York law\nis changed and you pass something saying you get a lien\non property if you have delinquent property, parking\ntickets.\nMR. CARDOZO: That is right, and that would\nget us right back into the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the\nFederal, the 100 percent withholding, relates to taxes?\nMR. CARDOZO: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Taxes, not for parking\ntickets or anything else.\nMR. CARDOZO: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it\ndoes. It relates to unpaid property, unpaid property\ntaxes. It doesn't apply to unpaid parking tickets.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Howley, you have two minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J.P. HOWLEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. HOWLEY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nArticle 29 of the European Convention\nexpressly excludes any intent to create an exception for\ntax claims. That was the international practice at the\ntime. What we have here is a bootstrap and I refer to\nthe Court to its decision in Ministry of Defense of\nRepublic of Iran against Elahi, where this Court said\nthat when you have an action to impose a lien, it is\nanalyzed as an attachment under Section 1609-1610 of the\nForeign Sovereign Immunities Act. And what the Foreign\nSovereign Immunities Act says is you cannot use an\nattachment to get jurisdiction where jurisdiction\notherwise does not exist.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you take the position\nthat it's improper even to notice the property with the\nlien?\nMR. HOWLEY: Under New York law, yes, and we\nhave Chief Judge Fulbright for a unanimous --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, let's assume that\nyou owe the taxes.\nMR. HOWLEY: Well, we say that there's no\nright to impose the lien because the Vienna Convention\nand New York law prohibit the taxation of the property\nand you cannot impose the lien to collect something that\nyou're not entitled to. And this is a dispute that has\nhistorically been resolved through diplomacy, not in the\ncourts, because the fact is whatever happens in this\ncase to India and Mongolia is likely to happen to the\nUnited States around the world and that's a foreign\npolicy question for the State Department to decide.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You mean we'll have to\nstart paying our taxes around the world?\nMR. HOWLEY: I'm afraid so, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a real problem for\nus? I don't think so.\nMR. HOWLEY: I am afraid so.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
