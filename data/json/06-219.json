GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nRespondent asks this Court to recognize a\nnew constitutional tort under Bivens and the Just\nCompensation Clause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Garre, could you crank\nup the thing? The sound isn't working, I don't think,\nMr. Garre.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think it needs a\nlittle upcranking.\nGood.\nMR. GARRE: Hopefully that's better.\n-- recognize a new constitutional tort under\nBivens and the Just Compensation Clause that would\nsubject public officials to personal liability for\nconduct that he concedes does not amount to a taking.\nRecognizing that constitutional tort would require this\nCourt to extend Bivens to an entirely new context, it\nwould disregard limits that have existed for centuries\non Just Compensation Clause claims, and it would skew\nthe enforcement of important public land use objectives\nand thereby threaten public resources and public lands.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Garre, there's a\nrecord here that the district court said there was\nsubstantial evidence, enough to go to trial, of a\npattern of harassing conduct that included trespasses on\nthis man's lodge and leaving the place in disarray,\nvideotaping the guests, selective enforcement of the\ngrazing laws, a whole pattern of things, even asking the\nBureau of Indian Affairs to impound his cattle? This\nman says, this has been done to me by officers of my\ngovernment. Is there a remedy?\nMR. GARRE: Justice Ginsburg, there are a\nnumber of avenues that he could have sought to prevent\nthis alleged conduct and that he did invoke. We don't\nthink that there is a remedy under Bivens or an inferred\naction under the Just Compensation Clause.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what is, what is\nthere that will really be effective, because if you tell\nme challenging each citation for violating the grazing\npermit --\nMR. GARRE: He can challenge the citations\nfor challenging the -- canceling the grazing permits --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And then the behavior\nwill continue and he'll get one more and one more and\none more.\nMR. GARRE: Well, I don't think that that's\na reasonable inference, Justice Ginsburg. In fact, the\nIBLA considered and rejected each of the alleged\nadministrative actions on which his claim is now based.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: May I ask a quick\nquestion. I had the same list of alleged acts, and I\nthink many of them are uncontested, that Justice\nGinsburg mentioned. Just as a matter of policy, can you\ninform me, when the Solicitor General's Office takes\nthis case do you look into whether any of these things\nhappen and the Justice Department issues a warning,\ndon't do this any more? If these things are as Justice\nGinsburg explained you don't defend all of those\nactions?\nMR. GARRE: Well, our position is that he\nhasn't established a constitutional tort or an\nactionable claim under RICO.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I know that. I know that.\nMR. GARRE: To answer your question, the\nGovernment takes these types of allegations seriously.\nIt's taken seriously at the line level at the Bureau of\nLand Management. It's taken seriously within the\nDepartment of Interior and it's taken seriously at the\nDepartment of Justice.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because if this, if this\ncontinues, your argument -- and I understand your\nargument that there's no essential free-standing cause\nof action for damages -- basically means he has a right\nto go broke with attorneys' fees challenging each\nindividual incursion, each individual wrong.\nWell, again that assumes that he wouldn't\nget any relief out of the IBLA. That assumes that if he\nhad gone to the IBLA and said, you canceled my grazing\npermits for grounds that weren't valid, that the BLM\nwould have proceeded to engage in the same conduct. In\nfact, the IBLA --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well that's exactly what\nhe alleged and he said, and it happened for over a\nfive-year period.\nMR. GARRE: But we know from the decisions\nof the IBLA that he did challenge that they rejected the\ngrounds that he --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They may be wrong, too.\nThey may have been as much a part of the conspiracy as\nthe officers who conducted it. And there are indeed\nthose in the West who think that the BLM does, does act\nquite arbitrarily and high-handedly and is, is upheld\nby, by the, the administrative courts. Now, if that's a\nproblem, what's the solution to that problem?\nMR. GARRE: Well, Justice Scalia, to bring\nan APA action to Federal court challenging the final\ndecisions of the IBLA.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's one by one. Every\ntime there is another trespass he has to go all the way\nthrough the administrative procedure and then when the,\nwhen the administrative court says, well, it was okay,\nthen he has to go through the regular Federal courts.\nThat doesn't seem to me like a realistic remedy, not for\nsomebody who claims he's being systematically harassed\nfor five years as, as is the claim here.\nMR. GARRE: Again, I think you have to\nassume that his claims would not succeed either at the\nadministrative level or at the APA level, and if he\ngot --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't assume that at all.\nEven if they, even if they succeed, they say, yes,\nyou're right, they trespassed, good for you. I mean,\nwhat is the remedy if they did trespass? What\nadministrative remedy does he obtain.\nMR. GARRE: Well, if there's a trespass he\ncan go, he can obtain an action under the Federal Tort\nClaims Act. A trespass is an unauthorized taking.\nThat's the way that this Court has treated it 1952 in\nthe Hasselly case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- the photographing\nof his guests who he brings onto his ranch to hunt and\nthey pay him for that. And then he claims that the BLM\nfollows them just to harass them, just taking\nphotographs. What relief could he get for that?\nMR. GARRE: Well, he claimed that they were\ntrespassing on his lands.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's assume they wasn't\ntrespassing.\nMR. GARRE: Well, he'd raised that objection\nbefore the IBLA and the IBLA concluded, and we think\nreasonably, that, given the history of the disputes with\nthis individual, given his litigious nature, that it was\nreasonable for the BLM officials who were out there to\nbe documenting his trespasses on public lands, and\nthat's an important dimension of this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was one\naspect of the videotaping his guests, that the\nGovernment was doing it on its own land, on public land.\nThey had cameras and the cameras were stationed so they\nweren't trespassing, they were just making the guests\nfeel uncomfortable.\nMR. GARRE: To document, to document his\ntrespasses on other lands, and that's -- the citation to\nthe IBLA decision is at footnote 2 of our reply brief\nand it discusses that allegation in depth.\nIn any event --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I would really like to\nhave your answer to my opening question, and I said: If\nyour only answer is each time something, he is charged\nby the BLM people, he goes one at a time, engaging a\nlawyer, spending a lot of time, but it was, one of the\nbriefs called it, dying a thousand deaths. He doesn't\nwant that. He wants to say: Stop, stop this whole\npattern; not one citation; stop this whole pattern. How\ndoes he get that remedy?\nMR. GARRE: He does not have a remedy under\nthe Just Compensation Clause or Bivens, Justice\nGinsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What does, what does he\nhave?\nMR. GARRE: He can challenge, he can\nchallenge these actions under the administrative process\navailable to him under the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Piecemeal.\nMR. GARRE: -- APA --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Piecemeal.\nMR. GARRE: -- like any number of other\ncontexts.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does he have any action\nthat is other than piecemeal?\nMR. GARRE: He has to challenge each\nadministrative action --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it the answer is\nno.\nMR. GARRE: -- that he claims is unlawful.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Were any of these\nadministrative actions found to be unfounded? In other\nwords, did he win any of the trespass citations?\nMR. GARRE: He did not. In fact, the IBLA\nfound that the BLM had a right of administrative access\nto cross his lands to get to public lands which it was\nadministering. And again, this case would have been\nquite different if the IBLA had found that the BLM\nofficers were acting without legitimate authority.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm surprised you say\npiecemeal. I would have thought most agencies in the\ngovernment have like an inspector general or someone\nthat you can complain.\nMR. GARRE: And they do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You can write them a letter\nand you say, look at what's been going on, they've been\ntrespassing, they've indicted me on a false charge; I\nwant you to see the whole list here and I'd like you to\ndo something about it. And if they don't do anything\nabout it, you go to your senator. Maybe you can go to\nthe newspapers. I mean, has any of that happened here?\nMR. GARRE: It has, Justice Breyer. It has.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what's been the result\nof that?\nMR. GARRE: The result of that is it was\ndetermined that these actions by these line officers of\nthe Bureau of Land Management were perfectly\nappropriate, that they were dealing with someone who has\nsystematically violated the permits and conditions that\nare found --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Who made that, who made\nthat determination, including the selective citations?\nMR. STARR: I believe there was an inspector\ngeneral investigation, investigation within the\nDepartment of Interior that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the Department\nof Interior reached a settlement agreement in which they\ntold the line people at BLM to stop.\nMR. GARRE: There was a settlement\nagreement, Justice Ginsburg. But the Department of\nInterior stands behind the actions that are issued, at\nissue in this case, and I think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Nonetheless, they did\nenter a settlement which included that this behavior was\ngoing to stop.\nMR. GARRE: Well, I'm not sure that that's a\nfair characterization. I mean, like any party to\nlitigation, any party to multiple lawsuits and claims,\nthere are many reasons why it might be deemed in the\ninterest of a person to agree to a settlement. And I\ndon't think it's fair to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you agree at least\nto a minimum that we must accept for purposes of this\nproceeding that what the complaint alleged, and what the\ndistrict court said on summary judgment, there was\nsufficient evidence to go to a trial. That that's true.\nSo we have to accept his allegations that there were\nselective citations for violations of grazing -- grazing\nlaws, that they broke into his lodge and messed the\nplace up?\nMR. GARRE: This Court has to accept those\nfactual allegations, to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Okay. So that's --\nMR. GARRE: -- to be sure. But the court\nof --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that's the case we\nhave. And you're telling me that the only remedy a\ncitizen, assuming the truth of those allegations, is to\nfight these actions one by one?\nMR. GARRE: That's a fulsome remedy, Justice\nGinsburg, when you think of the claims that could be\nbrought administratively under the Administrative\nProcedures Act, under the Federal Tort Claims Act, to\nreceive damages, to receive injunctions --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What damages would you get\nfor the trespass of a -- one, one BLM agent on your\nland? A lot of money you're going to get for that?\nWould it, would it come anywhere close to\nreimbursing you for the lawyers' fees that it's taken to\ngo, to go all the way through the litigation?\nMR. GARRE: If the allegation is that these\ntrespasses have in effect deprived me of my property\nwhich is my business, then conceivably he could make a\nrequest for a large amount of damages.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He doesn't say it deprived\nhim of his property which is his business.\nMR. GARRE: No, I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He is saying it's a\ntrespass; get off my land.\nMR. GARRE: He, he has made both claims,\nJustice Scalia. And I think -- he has, he has\ncomplained about BLM officials exercising the right of\nadministrative access, which has been confirmed at the\nadministrative level and which is well settled. And he\nhas made the more general complaint that these\ntrespasses have -- and interfered with his businesses\nand interfered with his property. He filed a, a bond in\nthis Court seeking, claiming the damages were in several\nmillion dollars related to the business. So that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can he get injunctive\nrelief? Can he get injunctive relief? You said\nsomething about, that, you said they may seek to enjoin\nconduct that they claim will amount to an uncompensated\ntaking.\nCan he have this litany of things that have\nhappened and go into a court and say court, enjoin those\n--\nMR. GARRE: Certainly he could under the\nAPA. He could challenge the administrative actions he\ncomplained about, and if court concludes those are\nunauthorized or unconstitutional he could obtain an\ninjunction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He can bring, he can\nbring this, he could bring this not one action at a\ntime, but he could complain all at once about\neverything?\nMR. GARRE: Well, the other thing to keep in\nmind is that many of these discrete administrative\nactions -- for example, take the cancellation of the\npermits. That was based on a course of conduct that\nincluded 20 formal trespasses, disregarding trespass\nnotices by the BLM, 20 violations of his grazing\npermits. All of that would be part of a record before\nthe IBLA and before a Federal court in an APA. It would\nhave an opportunity to review those allegations and\ndetermine whether or not the alleged Federal action was\nunlawful. And if a court believed --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He could -- he could not\ngo into a Federal court with a Federal question? He\nwould have to go to the initial decision maker, then the\nI --\nMR. GARRE: He would have to exhaust his\nadministrative remedies, just like any number of other\npeople who believe that they have been wronged by the\nFederal Government.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Part of his claim is -- is\nselective enforcement. You know, maybe he did trespass,\nmaybe some of his cattle did stray on somebody's land.\nBut they are beating on him because of what they say is\nhis failure to give a reciprocal easement which the\nGovernment is entitled to.\nTo what extent was any of the administrative\napproval of the BLM agents' actions, to what extent was\nthat based on the legitimacy of seeking to extract this\nreciprocal easement from him? Because I don't see that\nit's legitimate at all.\nMR. GARRE: Well, the I -- let me answer\nthat in two ways. First the IBLA found that there was\nnot an effort to extort or blackmail Mr. -- the\nRespondent for exercising his rights.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was that because the\nGovernment was entitled to the reciprocal easement? Is\nthat why they said that?\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't extortion because\nhe should have given the easement.\nMR. GARRE: No. I don't think that's what\nthe IBLA found and we cite the part of the IBLA record\nat footnote 2 of our reply brief.\nSecondly it's well established that the\nGovernment can seek reciprocal arrangements with respect\nto property. The Court in the Leo Sheep case forced the\nGovernment to seek reciprocal arrangements.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not after, not after they\nhave already given away -- I mean, yes; they could come\nto him anew and say I'll tell you what, if you give us\nthis easement we'll give you yet another one.\nMR. GARRE: That's true.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But he had one in, from the\npast, which -- which his predecessor had given a\nreciprocal easement for, and the Government failed to\nrecord the easement and therefore was is deprived of it.\nMR. GARRE: That's true. But I think it's\nimportant to keep in mind the scope of the claim before\nthe Court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And they're mad at him for\nnot giving back that easement which they failed to\nrecord.\nMR. GARRE: The BLM doesn't have to stop\nenforcing its laws and regulations once someone refuses\nto enter into reciprocal arrangements. There are\nthousands of reciprocal arrangements.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't be reciprocal.\nWhat was the Government offering to give him in exchange\nfor his, his reaffirming the prior easement that they\nhad failed to record? What was the Government giving\nhim in exchange?\nMR. GARRE: A valuable right-of-way, Justice\nScalia, that - that was for 30 years, that covered 14\nmiles of public road --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's what his\npredecessor had.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He had that already.\nMR. GARRE: Well, but that did not convey\nwith the property. It had to be reassigned in order for\nMr. Robbins to take advantage of that right-of-way.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I did not -- I did not\nunderstand that.\nMR. GARRE: Absolutely. And it's in the\nregulations. The right-of-way has to be reassigned, and\nit wasn't going to be reassigned because Respondent\nrefused to agree to the reciprocal easement and because\nhe refused to make rental payments.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: As originally negotiated,\nwith I think Nelson. Was the right-of-way cancellable\nat any time? Or how long would the right-of-way last?\nMR. GARRE: The right-of-way was for 30\nyears which was long than the 20-year easement that the\nGovernment got in exchange. And this something that was\nnegotiated at arm's length by parties that didn't have\nthe acrimonious relationship that developed between\nRespondent and the BLM.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I -- I\nthink part of what's happening here is there is\ndifference between the regulation on the books and how\nthey are enforced. Just as a hypothetical, let's say\nthey don't -- the Government doesn't get its reciprocal\neasement that it wants, and so it says look, we normally\ndon't strictly enforce these cattle trespass things, but\nwe are going to go by the book with this guy until he\ngives us the right-of-way. Every time his cattle cross\nover the line we are going to hit him with a trespass\ncitation. They don't do it for anybody else but,\nthey're going to do it for him because they want to get\nthe reciprocal right-of-way. Is that appropriate or\ninappropriate?\nMR. GARRE: Well, first I don't think it\ngives him a cause of action under Bivens or the Just\nCompensation Clause. Second --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that he can't --\nbut you're saying his remedy is to challenge each one.\nBut actually each one, his cattle did trespass, so he\ndoesn't have a good case. It's just that out in the\nWest they don't actually give citations every time a cow\ncrosses the river.\nMR. GARRE: Then I, then I don't think he is\na very sympathetic plaintiff to be complaining that he\nis entitled to violate BLM rules or regulations. There\nis a certain amount of give and take that we think is\ninherent in these reciprocal arrangements and we think\nthat the Just Compensation Clause tolerates.\nThese are, the Just Compensation Clause or\nproperty rights here are protected fundamentally by\nState law. That's why any unauthorized action by the\nGovernment is a trespass, which is, which is dealt with\nunder State law. The Just Compensation --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why is it a State law\nmatter? Why didn't he know about this possibility? Why\ndidn't he know that his predecessor in title had\ngranted? Why wasn't there an actual notice, given the\nfact that everybody in this area of the country seems as\na matter of course to give mutually beneficial\nrights-of-way? I agree it wasn't recorded.\nMR. GARRE: I think he was on notice. The\nBLM made a determination that because it wasn't\nrecorded, it wouldn't seek to enforce that against\nRespondent. It may be that it was -- it made a legal\nerror on that; I don't know. But it made that\ndetermination --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a given in the\nrecord. The record is that he was not on notice. So\nwhether one says, gee that's unlikely if he wasn't --\nMR. GARRE: But in any event, the point is\nthat the BLM recognized that it had to negotiate a new\nreciprocal arrangement with Respondent and it sought to\ndo so.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it's trying to cover\nfor its own sloppiness or carelessness in not\nrecording --\nMR. GARRE: Well, it, it's trying to seek,\nestablish a new reciprocal arrangement. Regardless of\nwhy it was back in the position of having to do so, it\ndid so in a way that it did in any number of other\nsituations that did arise.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can I ask you about the\nBivens theory here before your time runs out? Doesn't\nDavis versus Passman help the Respondent here?\nMR. GARRE: I, I don't think so, Your Honor.\nI think what is distinct about the Bivens claim here is\nfirst Bivens and Just Compensation Clause claims are\nfundamentally incompatible. And that in Bivens, its\ndamages are nothing. Here the constitutional right\nactually explicitly provides a remedy, just\ncompensation. Secondly, just compensation claims are\nclaims against the Government.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well that's because we\nassume it's focused just on his property and that the\nproperty was ultimately the thing that was in issue.\nBut if you have all these other retaliatory actions, and\nwrongful actions taken by the Government tangential to\nthis dispute, I take it Davis versus Passman, broadly\nread, says we can use Bivens if there is no other way to\nget a remedy against the Government.\nMR. GARRE: Well -- two points. First,\nDavis versus Passman was decided in a day in which this\nCourt was much more likely to infer new causes of action\nfrom the Constitution or from statutes. The Court in\nits recent cases, most recently Malesko, has said that\nit's sworn off that habit, and it's refused to recognize\nany new Bivens action in 25 years since those cases were\ndecided.\nSecondly, the Respondent here has ample\nremedies and avenues that he could seek. If he believes\nthat there has been unauthorized trespass he can seek\ndamages under the Federal Tort Claims Act.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose we think --\nsuppose we disagree with you on the latter point. We\nthink he is really in a bind; there's not really\nanything he can do. Doesn't that invoke the Davis\nversus Passman rationale?\nMR. GARRE: I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: To expand -- it would be\nan expansion of Bivens.\nMR. GARRE: It would be closer to it but the\nCourt would still have to confront the question of\nwhether it would be appropriate to infer a\nconstitutional tort under the Just Compensation Clause.\nAnd we would urge the Court not to do so.\nThere is an overarching question here of\nqualified immunity. Whatever is true with respect to\nwhether this new constitutional tort should be created\ntowards other claims before the Court, the Petitioners\non this case were not on clear notice that their actions\nin responding to someone who had systematically violated\nthe rules and regulations, which -- on the books for\nsome time -- would subject them to personal damages\nactions and in fact treble damages under the RICO\nstatute. For that, for that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If a -- including, you\nknow, busting into his lodge and disrupting the\nfurniture and all of that, they thought that that was\nprobably --\nMR. GARRE: Well, if that's true --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- probably allowed?\nMR. GARRE: If that's -- they would be on\nnotice, that that conduct if true could subject them to\na tort action under the Federal Tort Claims Act. There\nis no decision that the court of appeals or\nRespondent has pointed to that would put the Petitioners\nhere on notice in the specific situation they\nconfronted, that their actions could subject them to a\nconstitutional tort which had never been recognized by\nany court, whether their actions could subject them to\ntreble damages under RICO.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a test for -- for\n-- for qualified immunity? You have to know -- not\nonly --\nMR. GARRE: You have to have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not enough to know\nthat your action was wrongful? You have to know the\nparticular statute or constitutional provision under\nwhich a remedy would be sought?\nMR. GARRE: Yes. The first question is\nwhether he has established a violation of the right.\nAnd the rights that are alleged in this case that are\nbefore this Court, or a right under the compensation\nclause of the Fifth Amendment to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're suggesting\nthey would not be immune from a State law trespass\naction?\nMR. GARRE: No. The -- the -- the Congress\nhas waived the sovereign immunity from those types of\nclaims under the Federal Tort Claims Act.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The people who had done\nthis --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Federal Tort\nClaims Act is against the United States. It's not\nagainst the --\nMR. GARRE: It's against the United States\nif they are acting within the scope of their conduct.\nIf it's unauthorized actions outside the scope of the\nconduct, then they can go directly against the\nindividuals. That's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then it wouldn't be a\nFederal Tort Claims Act.\nMR. GARRE: Well, then it would be\nadditional suits in State court. They could also --\nthere are also State, Federal and criminal laws that\nthey could seek to invoke or have invoked. But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But respect to the RICO\nclaim, assuming the RICO claim is upheld, what do you\nsay to your brother's argument that there is no history\nof qualified immunity for RICO claims? That the\nqualified immunity doctrine addresses the, the kind of\ndevelopment of squishier law under -- under 1983. So\nthat you simply have not qualified immunity.\nMR. GARRE: Two things, Justice Souter.\nFirst the argument was not raised below; we don't think\nit's properly before the Court.\nSecond, the question under qualified\nimmunity, and this Court made this clear in the Wyatt\ncase and again in the Knight case, it doesn't look to\nthe particular offense. It looks to the nature of the\nresponsibility that the Government officials are\nperforming. And here the nature of the responsibilities\nare enforcing grazing permits, enforcing access to\npublic lands, activities that BLM officials have\ndiscretion and have had discretion for more than a\ncentury to enforce. And we think that falls squarely\nwithin the rubric of qualified immunity.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well that may be a very --\nit seems to me that those may be good arguments, or at\nleast relevant arguments against the applicability of\nRICO in the first place. But if RICO is found to have\nbeen violated, I take it it would be an extension of\nqualified immunity jurisprudence --\nMR. GARRE: I don't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- to, to apply it to a\nRICO defendant.\nMR. GARRE: With respect, I don't think it\nwould be. First, the large portion of the courts of\nappeals that have addressed this have concluded that\nqualified immunity principles do extend to RICO. And\nsecond, again, the focus of the inquiry is on the nature\nof the responsibilities. It's not on the particular\noffense alleged. It's not on whether there's a\nviolation of that offense. It's the nature of the\nresponsibilities, and here these responsibilities,\nenforcing permits enforcing access and use of public\nland, and protecting against abuse of those lands, are\nthings that BLM officials and other government officers\nhave exercised their discretion to do for more than --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If this case were\nidentical, everything's the same, except that the\nofficials involved are state officials, would there be a\n1983 action?\nMR. GARRE: Well, no, because we don't think\nthat there's a violation of the Just Compensation Clause\nwhen someone doesn't take property, when someone doesn't\nact through allegedly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's a different --\nthat's a different reason. That's a merits defense. I\njust wondered if --\nMR. GARRE: Oh, are you -- the question with\nrespect to qualified immunity?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. You're saying there\nis no Bivens action, period.\nMR. GARRE: Well, we think that qualified\nimmunity now --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not even thinking\nof it. I just wonder if 1983 would apply and it would\nbe clear that there is an action. If you win, there\nwould be no problem.\nMR. GARRE: No, because there has been no\nviolation of the substantive Fifth Amendment right and\nthere has been no violation of Bivens.\nIt's important to recognize the overarching\ncontext of how the Federal Government manages the public\nlands. There are -- there are numerous reciprocal\narrangements that could be affected by this. Any time a\nlandowner refuses to enter into a reciprocal\narrangement, he can then turn around in any government\naction that is taken against that landowner, all he has\nto do is add on an element of wrongful subjective\nintent, and he can bring a constitutional tort claim, or\neven a RICO claim like the respondent here, and subject\nofficers to the threat of personal liability. And we\nthink that this would have a significant skewing effect\non legitimate government decision making.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Tribe.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. TRIBE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThere is a dramatic contrast between the\ninstantaneous judgments a school principal might have to\nmake in the face of complicated decisions like Tinker,\nand a deliberate decision over a course of almost a\ndozen years made by officials of the Bureau of Land\nManagement that the greater retaliate against someone\nfor refusing to relinquish his property to the\ngovernment without any compensation. You don't have to\nhave taken a special course in constitutional law to\nknow that that is clearly forbidden.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Tribe, can I get\nsomething straight? Is it indeed correct that what the\ngovernment was seeking here was an exchange of\neasements, that the government was going to give one and\nyour client would give the other?\nMR. TRIBE: No, Justice Scalia, that's not\ncorrect. That was what they did with Nelson, his\npredecessor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: With the predecessor in\ninterest of your client.\nMR. TRIBE: That's right. And what happened\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did what the government\ngave to your predecessor of interest, did that easement\ncontinue? The government has just said that it expired.\nMR. TRIBE: The government is wrong. It\ncontinued.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's how I understood it.\nMR. TRIBE: It ran with the land, it was\npart of what he brought. If it had expired --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: This is the easement over\nthe roadway.\nMR. TRIBE: The right-of-way over the\ngovernment's roads.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: As opposed to the grazing\neasement.\nMR. TRIBE: As -- that's right. The\nright-of-way over the road of access, which they not\nonly canceled in July of 1985 but refused to maintain\nthemselves, so that he couldn't really access the ranch.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If they finally\ncanceled it, how did it -- I mean, if it runs with the\nland, they don't have the authority to cancel.\nMR. TRIBE: They didn't have the authority\nto cancel it simply because of the transfer of the land.\nThey allege that he had made various technical\nviolations on account of which they canceled it. But\nthe key point is, that was supposed to be the quid pro\nquo, that is, they have maintained all along that this\ncase is about that right-of-way and what an ingrate the\nrespondent is that he wants to continue enjoying it and\nnot give the easement. Well, he didn't enjoy it after\nJuly of 1995 when it was canceled. They wouldn't have\nhad to cancel it for alleged violations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care whether it was\ncanceled, but I must say, if they were just seeking a\nfair exchange of reciprocal easements, which landowners\ndo all the time --\nMR. TRIBE: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the system of lands out\nthere can't work without it.\nMR. TRIBE: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't see anything\nterribly wrong about the BLM people say okay, he wants\nto play hardball, he wants to play by the book, we'll\nplay by the book. What would be wrong with --\nMR. TRIBE: They didn't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: See, I wouldn't feel bad\nabout that if they said --\nMR. TRIBE: I wouldn't either.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- by God, every time his\ncows trespass, we're going to get him. Every time his\nhunting expeditions go on public land, we're going to\nget him. That would seem reasonable to me. So it\nreally is crucial to my view of the case that the\ngovernment was not seeking a new exchange, it was\nseeking --\nMR. TRIBE: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- for him to cough up --\nMR. TRIBE: To cough up that easement. And\nin fact when he said, he offered to negotiate, and the\nimmediate response from Mr. Vessels, who is since\ndiseased, was, the United States does not negotiate.\nThat wasn't just kind of starting of a bargaining\nposition. They dug in and for a series of years the\ndistrict court found, fully substantiated on the\npetition appellate via -- appendix to the petition at\npage 37a, not only playing hardball and being\nselectively tough on him, but a number of clearly\nillegal acts, breaking into his lodge. One of them\nparticularly striking to me at joint appendix 49 to 57,\ninciting a neighbor to ram a truck into the respondent\nwhile he was on horseback. Firemen --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Who would have thought --\nwait. When you say that, I mean, there's a lot of these\nacts, it seems, they are plainly illegal.\nMR. TRIBE: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if they are plainly\nillegal, then there are remedies in the courts.\nMR. TRIBE: There are remedies one by one\nfor each of these acts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. But what is\nactually worrying you, which probably you can address at\nsome point, is this: There are remedies one by one.\nThat's true. And each has one. And maybe you can even\nget injunctions against harassing.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, the remedies were\nacquittal. He was acquitted, for example.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, maybe he didn't do\nit.\nMR. TRIBE: He spent hundreds of thousands\nof dollars.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so it may be, they\nthought he did do it and --\nMR. TRIBE: No, no. They didn't think he\ndid do it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. TRIBE: He alleged --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did you bring a suit for\nmalicious prosecution?\nMR. TRIBE: That's part of -- this is a\nsuite like Hartman v. Moore. One of the acts that is\nclearly actionable under Bivens, if one has to dissect\nthe various predicate acts, is the fact that without\nprobable cause, at page 71 of the joint appendix, they\ndeliberately fabricated a felony charge.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now --\nMR. TRIBE: And when he was acquitted of\nthat by a jury that took 20 minutes, and said that they\nwere outraged by the BLM, they found other things to do.\nThey found other things --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he also lost the\nmalicious prosecution suit, didn't he? Didn't he bring\na malicious prosecution suit?\nMR. TRIBE: He tried to do that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And he lost.\nMR. TRIBE: He won some, he lost some, but\nthe --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe he should have won.\nWhat's worrying me throughout, if you want to know --\nMR. TRIBE: I sure do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is worrying me\nthroughout is, put this case to the side. If the Court\nrecognizes what I take it has not happened in the past,\nthat there is an action for private people to bring\nagainst the government, Bivens, under the Fifth\nAmendment, all of a sudden vast numbers of regulations,\nthe coal pillars in Holmes case, everything south of\nthat will be suddenly in Federal court as people claim\nthat what's going on with this regulation is there are\nindividuals in the government who have gone too far, and\nthey are just trying to get my property and the use of\nit, without paying a fair price. Now by the way,\nsometimes people in government do go too far, so many of\nthose claims might have some justification. But\nsuddenly I see the possibility of this kind of action\nbecoming a major roadblock, an obstacle sometimes used\nunjustifiably, and not necessarily, not necessary, this\nkind of thing, to impose a roadblock to totally\nlegitimate government regulatory action.\nMR. TRIBE: Justice Breyer, that -- that\nfloodgates concern was addressed by this Court not long\nenough in Hartman v. Moore when the remedy in that case\nfor a prosecution that was brought to retaliate against\nsomeone for the exercise of her First Amendment right\nwas a Bivens action against the postal inspectors who\nmade this all up. Now the Court there addressed the\npossibility that this would unleash a flood of lawsuits,\nand it said that over the past quarter century, there\nhad been only 12 Bivens or 1983 actions against this\nkind of retaliation. I suppose that is because not that\nmany postal inspectors or BLM guys think they can get\naway with deliberately retaliating against people for\nexercising their rights.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You see, part of what's\nworrying me is that once you get into the Fifth\nAmendment, which is -- prevents the government from\ntaking property for a public use without just\ncompensation, the possibility of the legal imagination\nbecomes endless. Because every time a person walks\nacross the doorstep, every time a person wants to\ninstall a pipe in the basement, read the meter -- I\nmean, I can see possibilities of actions of this kind\narising, and particularly when the government wants to\nbuy it and is pointing out all the reasons why it should\nbe sold. Is there a threat lurking in that\nconversation? You see what I'm worried about here,\nwhich wasn't present in the other case?\nMR. TRIBE: I see, but it was present in\nDavis, Davis v. Passman, to which Justice Kennedy\nreferred, already recognized a Bivens action for\nviolating something even more capacious, due process,\nequal protection. When this Court said in Village of\nWillowbrook against Oleck that there is a cause of\naction even for the naked assertion that you're treating\nme differently, did that open huge floodgates? Have we\nbeen flooded? It seems to me that the Court has\ndeveloped its own filters against the floodgate of\nretaliation claims. It's been --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure, Professor\nTribe, that the cases you cite at page 22, 23 of your\nbrief really support your position. The question is\nwhether there should be a freestanding cause of action\nfor damages.\nMR. TRIBE: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And in the brief you say\nthat the government says that this is limited First\nAmendment, and then you say, \"These remarkable claims\nare unsurprisingly false.\" I thought that was a rather\nsevere charge against the government, that it's\nmisrepresenting its cases.\nMR. TRIBE: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then in page 22 and 23,\nyou go ahead and you talk about Wisconsin versus Yoder,\nLefkowitz versus Turley, Bordenkircher, which I think\nwas vindictive prosecution or adding on charges. All of\nthose are in the -- every one of these cases are in the\ncontext of a criminal proceeding. Griffin, a murder\ncase. It's just alleging a constitutional --\nMR. TRIBE: But many of them are not,\nJustice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- alleging a\nconstitutional claim. Well, which one?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, for example, Shapiro v.\nThompson. The Court has said that the right to travel\ncannot be penalized. The broad point that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, no. That was, there\nwas an existing case or controversy there. That wasn't\na freestanding cause of action. None of these cases are\nfreestanding. Davis versus Passman, different.\nMR. TRIBE: And Hartman v. Moore, different.\nWhat we were answering there was not the point about a\nfreestanding cause of action.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me that\nthose cases do not support your position, and I don't\nthink it's correct to say that this is unsurprising,\nthat the government makes a false representation about\ncases.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, Justice Kennedy, that was\na response to their claim, that only with respect to the\nFifth Amendment is there a right. This was not the\nBivens question. Only with respect to the Fifth --\nFirst Amendment is there a right not to be retaliated\nagainst for the exercise of your rights.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think it was in the\ncontext of a freestanding right, but let's leave that\naside.\nMR. TRIBE: We can look at it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's right. It does\nseem to me that you are asking us to extend Bivens, this\nis an extension. Would you accept that?\nMR. TRIBE: In the sense that there has\nnever been a case just like it under Hope v. Pelzer,\nthere doesn't have to have been one like it. But we do\nthink that there is a compelling case, because there's\nno other way to enforce the just compensation right\nagainst a group of government agents who are determined\nto pile punishment upon punishment until someone caves\nin.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you say -- you\ncall it punishment, but in fact the government's\nposition on each of these particulars has generally been\nvindicated. When your client has appealed, they've\nupheld the trespass citations. When you've sued for\nmalicious prosecution, the suit's been rejected. Which\nof the government actions do you not have an existing\nremedy for, apart from the Racketeer and Corrupt -- RICO\nAct or the, this new Bivens claim?\nMR. TRIBE: Mr. Chief Justice, it is the\nretaliatory pattern that there is no remedy for. When\ngoing --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you point to any\none governmental action for which you do not have an\nexisting remedy?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, the action of falsely\nprosecuting him in retaliation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have a malicious\nprosecution claim for that. You brought that, you lost.\nMR. TRIBE: No, we did not bring a malicious\nprosecution claim for that felony charge.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You could have\nbrought one.\nMR. TRIBE: It would have been against\nFederal officials and that would have been then\ntransformed unless we brought it under Bivens, which is\nwhat we are trying to do, transformed into an action\nagainst the United States by the Westfall Act. That is\nall of these attempts --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And then if you would have\nsucceeded, you would have been compensated.\nMR. TRIBE: For that one event from the\nUnited States, but the BLM agents would not have been\ndeterred.\nIn any event, Carlson v. Green --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the theory of the\nTort Claims Act is that if the government is paying out\nof the treasury, it's going to see to it that its\nemployees don't continue to commit the tort. So I don't\nthink -- I don't think you can make the argument that it\nwould have had no effect on the improper behavior.\nMR. TRIBE: I think the most important point\nthat I'm trying to make, Justice Souter and Mr. Chief\nJustice, that when someone says, I do not want to give\nyou my property, you have to take it from me and give me\njust compensation, the position of the Government here\nis that there is no constitutional limit on the kind of\nretaliation they can engage in.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if the\nposition of the Government were more fairly represented\nthey would say, we don't want everyone to be able to\nclaim that everything we're doing under color of law is\nretaliation, because then we'll hear that against IRS\nagents, we'll hear it against OSHA agents. So long as\nyou -- and their position is you have a remedy for\neverything you're complaining about, and you invoked\nsome of them and you lost, you didn't invoke others and\nso you didn't prevail. But don't create a whole new\nremedy just because you're dissatisfied with having to\npursue each one individually.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, Bivens as a constitutional\ntort is not a new remedy. The question really is\nwhether there is any conceivable basis when they trash\nhis lodge, when they do all of the other things, for\ntreating this differently from another kind of\nconstitutional violation. I mean, they argue that it's\nvery important, even though we could have lots of people\nbringing unjustified suits, to have a Bivens remedy for\nretaliation against free speech. The reason that they\ngive is that free speech is easily chilled. But with\nproperty rights the Just Compensation Clause is kind of\nits own antifreeze.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. The reason would be\nprobably that the, if you can make a comparison. The\nnumber of Government actions that affect criminal\ncharges and so forth are tiny compared to the number of\ngovernmental actions that affect people's property.\nVirtually, I mean the number of Government actions\naffecting how people use their property, it's the whole\nseries of law books. It fills the room. And suddenly\nto open up a new remedy in that kind of thing is what's\nfrightening me, which is what I said already. So you\ndon't have to answer.\nMR. TRIBE: But Justice Breyer, the Court\nhas established in the area of retaliation against\npeople for the exercise of their rights, Title VII\nrights in Burlington, First Amendment rights --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Retaliation, what is\nretaliation? Isn't retaliation statutory?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's statutory.\nMR. TRIBE: Hartman is not statutory. Some\nof the -- Hartman is the First Amendment, and it's the\nBivens case. The point I was trying to make about that\nis that the Court has a body of law trying to filter out\nthrough requiring proof of causation, requiring proof of\nsubstantial injury, filter out these trivial cases where\nsomeone is simply making a nuisance.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Tribe, could I ask a\nquestion about the RICO claims?\nMR. TRIBE: Certainly.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Until I read this case, I\nhad never come across the concept that a Government\nemployee can be guilty of extortion by demanding money\nfor the Government and your brief didn't cite very much\nauthority for this anywhere in the history of extortion.\nMR. TRIBE: In the common law history,\nJustice Alito, we cited two cases from New York, the\nWhaley case in 1827 and Willett in 1915. And it was\nthat body of New York law from which the Hobbs Act\nlargely drew. Those were cases in which the courts said\nthat the fact that the government agent is extorting\nproperty for his own employer the government doesn't\nmake any difference; it is still extortion.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's not a lot of, that's\nnot a lot of authority, considering the long history of\nextortion, just two old New York cases.\nMR. TRIBE: There are plenty of cases,\nJustice Alito, that involve extortion for one's employer\nwhere the employer might be a union or a corporation or\na charitable body. But it's true the Hobbs Act has not\nbeen applied, in my research anyway I have not seen it\napplied, to this kind of extortion. But the language\nclearly covers it and the language of RICO clearly\ncovers it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose you have a librarian\nin a courthouse and the librarian is charging lawyers 25\ncents a page for photocopies, but there's some library\nrule that says the fee is supposed to be 10 cents a\npage. Now is that, is that a RICO?\nMR. TRIBE: If the librarian thinks that,\nthe legislature is not giving us enough money, so I'm\ngoing to deliberately use my authority to get an extra\nfive cents from everybody, I suppose if you could prove\nwillfulness, which is an important element of Hobbs, and\nif there were several librarians and there was a pattern\nand you could establish the other prerequisites of RICO,\nit could be a RICO violation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the two cases you\ncite, the first one is the person who was charged with\nextortion is a judge --\nMR. TRIBE: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And he was extorted on the\nground that he told the plaintiff to pay the defendant,\nso the money wasn't given to the government. So I don't\nsee that that's a difference. And then the second case\n--\nMR. TRIBE: The second case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- it may have been, but\nyou say \"See Also,\" which is a sign to me there's\nsomething wrong with that case.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. TRIBE: I don't, I don't think there is,\nJustice Breyer, and it's very short.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm surprised that you\ndidn't put it first if there wasn't.\nPage 49.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, Willett versus Devoy, it\ninvolved a clerk demanding more money than the law\nallowed, and the court said: \"No distinction is made on\nthe ground that the official keeps the fee or turns it\nover to the government. Such a judge-made restriction\non the general statute requiring that the money be kept\nby the individual might itself bring about uncertainty,\nconfuse and possibly great injustice.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why did you say \"See Also\"?\nMR. TRIBE: I don't remember.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say this clearly\nestablishes. Are the BLM folks supposed to have known\nabout Willett versus Devoy?\nMR. TRIBE: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- as clearly\nestablishing their liability for what you call\nextortion? I'm sure what they would call trying to save\nthe taxpayers money and getting the type of reciprocal\nagreement with this landowner that they have got with\nthousands of others.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, first\nof all, when you keep calling it a reciprocal agreement\nit does trouble me. They weren't giving him anything\nfor this easement which they had already extracted from\nhis predecessor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree if the\ncase were otherwise -- and I gather we have a factual\ndispute on that -- that it would have been all right? I\nmean, if he didn't have this other easement already, but\nthey were trying to negotiate it, that this type of\nplaying hardball, I guess is one way to put it, would be\nall right?\nMR. TRIBE: It makes all the difference in\nthe world. They were trying to get the easement for\nnothing. I mean, it's very much --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's what\nI'm trying to get, to see if you agree with that. In\nother words, everything about this case would otherwise\nbe, I'm sure not breaking the laws, but otherwise it\nwould be all right if they were trying to get a\nreciprocal easement?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, most of what they did\nwould not have been an okay method of getting a\nreciprocal easement, anyway. But the attempt to get it\nwould be fine. It's not that they are not entitled to a\nreciprocal easement. That might have been a problem\nunder Nollan and Dolan to figure out whether there was\nenough connection, but I think there would have been\nenough.\nThe problem was that they were using the\nright-of-way, which was long gone, as an excuse to get\nan invaluable piece of property that they had no right\nto get. They were then trying to -- they were basically\nsaying, and they made it explicit, give us this easement\nfor nothing or we'll bury you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Tribe, I'll tell what\nyou troubles me about this case. There are overzealous\ngovernment agents. There always have been and I am sure\nthat, assuming all of the misbehavior described here is\ncorrect, I'm sure it is not the first time this has\nhappened. Government agents sometimes get overzealous.\nBut why should there be this extraordinary remedy when\nthe overzealousness happens to be attached to a desire\nto get a piece of land, whereas if they had just picked\non this guy because they didn't like the way he combed\nhis hair or for any other reason and had done the same\nthings you wouldn't have your Bivens action, right?\nMR. TRIBE: Nor would Nollan have come out\nthe same way if they weren't trying to get an easement\nin return for something which wasn't -- which you called\nextortion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no. If they were\ntrying to get some other property for it or, or, or\nmoney for it, it didn't turn --\nMR. TRIBE: I guess the straightforward\nanswer that I would give to your question I think is\nthat the Constitution does guarantee that the Government\ncannot take your property for public use without just\ncompensation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The whole spectrum of\npossible Government misbehavior, selective enforcement,\nthe whole spectrum, the only, the only times we're going\nto allow a cause of action under Bivens or under, under\nnot 1983 -- yes -- the only times we're going to do that\nis when there is a demand for property?\nMR. TRIBE: You've certainly done it with\nrespect to the Eighth Amendment. You've done it with\nrespect to speech. You've done it with respect to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But Professor Tribe, all\nthese cases are cases in which there is -- Nollan, you\nhave a cause of action to challenge the permit and this\nis just a, this is just a constitutional defense.\nThat's different from a freestanding cause of action.\nAnd I share Justice Scalia's concern. It seems to me in\nthinking about this case there is -- there could be\nsomething very wrong here, going after a person because\nof what he's done. Suppose the Government wants\nsomebody to be a witness in a trial and he won't do it,\nand they go around hurting his business, they go around\ninvading his property and so forth. That to me is\noutrageous and you might have an argument that there\nshould be a Bivens cause of action for that.\nAnd Justice Scalia's question -- I had the\nsame question -- is why do we think it to the property?\nThe essence here, the essence of what's going on, is\nthat they're being vindictive against this person. Now\nagain, the cases you're citing, include Hartman, which\nis a free speech case which is different, really don't\nsupport you. I think this is an extension of Bivens.\nMR. TRIBE: Justice Kennedy, if it's an\nextension, it's I think implicit in Bivens' logic.\nBivens deals with the cases --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Fair enough, but it's an\nextension of Bivens.\nMR. TRIBE: The Fifth Amendment is different\nfrom the First, but is it different in a relevant way?\nThe Just Compensation Clause does give the government an\nincentive, if they can avoid having to use eminent\ndomain and tax the public, gives them an incentive to\ntry to squeeze property out of somebody. If it has any\nincentive effect, it's one that points to the need for a\nBivens remedy. Why is a Bivens remedy --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But are they\ndisabled from negotiating? If they go up to somebody\nand say, you know, we'd really like a right-of-way\nbecause we have some interest in lands that we need to\nmaintain on the other side, and the person says, no and,\nyou know, get off my property, do they have to shrug\ntheir shoulders and say all right? Or can they say,\nwell, you know, we're neighbors, we have a lot of\ninterests in common and we should work together? Is\nthat all of a sudden extortion?\nMR. TRIBE: No, Mr. Chief Justice. Working\ntogether is what this guy tried to do at the beginning.\nHe said, I'm happy to negotiate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how many trespass\n--\nMR. TRIBE: They said: We don't negotiate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- citations for his\ncattle does it take before it's all of a sudden\nextortion?\nMR. TRIBE: The record in the case shows\nthat on those very instances where he was cited with\ntrespass others who were doing the identical thing were\nnot. And the IBLA has said --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And he challenged\nthe citations and they were rejected.\nMR. TRIBE: The IBLA rejected them because\nit said it has no jurisdiction. This was at -- in its\ndecision at 170 IBLA in 2006. No jurisdiction to\nconsider whether the motive was retaliatory, whether it\nwas unconstitutional, whether it was part of a pattern.\nAnd this Court has said that one can't use the APA in\nthat way either. Nor could an injunction be used to get\na pattern like this because of Rule 65D and\nInternational Longshoremen, try to frame an injunction\nsaying: Don't keep trashing this guy and ruining his\nbusiness and harassing and surveilling his guests and\nwhatever else you can come up with in order to squeeze\nhis property out of him. No other remedy will work.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So are you saying that\nthere was therefore no way short of Bivens even to\nchallenge or even to vindicate his claim of selective\nprosecution.\nMR. TRIBE: He could have taken that one\nitem and under a decision like Hartman vindicated it.\nBut as is clear from the way he tried to challenge these\nindividual things and then concluded, as we explained in\nour brief, that it was taking years and costing hundreds\nof thousands of dollars more than was involved in each\nindividual one, that was hopeless.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I appreciate that, but I\nthought you made the further claim -- maybe I\nmisunderstood it -- that if he had gone from the\nadministrative tribunal, or attempted to, to get into\nthe district court, he could not have gotten into\ndistrict court under the act.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, he wouldn't have had --\nbecause he would have had no record. That is, the\nreview under the APA by the district court would have\nbeen based on the evidentiary record he made. And the\nIBLA specifically ruled that it would not entertain\nevidence about the reasons that the BLM officials had\nfor going after him. There would be no evidence to\nsupport his claim.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Could he have gone into the\ndistrict court and said, I tried to make a record but\nthey wouldn't let me; let me make a record now? Could\nhe have done that?\nMR. TRIBE: I believe the district court's\njurisdiction in reviewing a final agency action is\nlimited to the agency record.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. You can go to an\nagency and say, agency I want to do such and such, dah\ndah dah, here are my reasons. Agency says no. I want\nreview.\nMR. TRIBE: So a challenge to the IBLA's\nassertion --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know. You might\nhave written to the Secretary of the Interior:\nSecretary, I want to you do such and such, please. No.\nOkay, review.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, he did write to the\nSecretary of the Interior.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what happened?\nMR. TRIBE: He was not given an answer. So\nwhat can one say?\nThe district court decided -- lest you\nassume that because he wasn't given an answer he doesn't\nhave a case, the district court said, as hard as it is\nto prove these things, he has substantial evidence that\nthey were picking on him solely to get the property, not\nbecause they didn't like him, not for some other reason;\nthey were trying to get property for which they were\nunwilling to pay.\nIt's doubtful that they could have taken\nit by eminent domain because the laws limiting the\nability of the BLM require proving necessity and there\nis nothing in the record suggesting that they needed\nthis easement. There is plenty in the record suggesting\nthat he couldn't access his own property as long as the\nroadway wasn't maintained in a passable condition, and\none of the ways they retaliated against him was to\nrefuse to maintain the roadway.\nThe record is also clear that his\nbusiness suffered greatly. So that if the result is\nthat someone who is trying to insist that if you want my\nproperty, you have to take it by eminent domain and give\nme just compensation, can't get help in those other\nways, this is crucial.\nWhat would have happened in Kaiser\nAetna, if when the Government said we think we have an\neasement to the Laguna pond, instead of going to court,\nwhich they did and they lost, if they had said well we\nare going to ram our motor boats or invite people to ram\ntheir motor boats into your sailboat? We are going to\nruin your business in the Kuapa pond until you give the\npublic an easement. Only a Bivens cause of action which\nthe Court has recognized in other areas, in other\nconstitutional claims -- due process, free speech,\nEighth Amendment -- only a Bivens cause of action is\ndirectly responsive to that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. A, an action\nagainst the Government for ramming your sailboat is\ndirectly responsive to that. You get -- you get full\nrecovery.\nMR. TRIBE: The Westfall Act makes an\nexception when you are making a constitutional claim.\nThat is, in 1988 when the Court passed the Westfall Act,\nthere were two exceptions 2679B(2)(a) and (b) were\nconstitutional claims and statutory claims.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't need the\nConstitution to the sue the Government for ramming your\nsailboat. Basic state tort law.\nMR. TRIBE: Mr. Chief Justice --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can answer.\n(A little laughter.)\nMR. TRIBE: It seems to me that state tort\nlaw does not get at the harm that he has suffered. It\ngets at each individual piece. But the main harm he\nsuffered is that they are circumventing the Just\nCompensation Clause as the one way that the Fifth\nAmendment was designed to permit the Government to get\nproperty for public use. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMR. TRIBE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Garre, you have\nfour minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY C. GARRE,\nFOR PETITIONERS\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nFirst I want to clarify, the question of the\nassignment. And our position, it's always been our\nposition that a new right-of-way had to be issued after\nthe property was sold. And I'll point the Court to JA\n84, which is where the BLM officials made clear at the\noutset that an assignment was required. Point the Court\nto JA 100 which is the right-of-way --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They might have been lying\nabout that --\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- just as they lied about\na lot of other stuff, according to --\nMR. GARRE: Pointing to JA 100 which is the\nright-of-way, which says that in accordance with Federal\nregulations, and I point the Court to 43 CFR 2803, which\ndiscusses assignments and makes clear that assignments\nhave to be approved.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was\nsomething about Nelson having assigned his, the\nright-of-way that he had to the Government.\nMR. GARRE: Justice Ginsburg, assignments\nhave to be approved by the BLM. That's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But it wasn't that\nit was a new assignment; it was the former owner\nassigned it and the BLA -- BLM approved.\nMR. GARRE: It was never approved. And\nthat's clear, there was never any valid assignment.\nThat's why the reciprocal arrangement had to be\nnegotiated anew and again, I point to 43 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why did\nyou revoke it later, if it wasn't valid?\nMR. GARRE: It -- it was revoked as part of\nthe decision not to assign it. And that's clear from\nthe decision canceling the right-of-way. There was no\nassignment that could be approved, and rents had not\nbeen paid on it. So it was combined with the\nassignment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't there be an\nassignment? Why, why would the prior owner have any --\nany interest in not assigning it?\nMR. GARRE: In order for the right-of-way,\nbecause these are rights-of-way to public lands. They\nhave to approved by new -- once new property owners seek\nto assert them. And again the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The prior owner did\nassign it. The stopper was the BLM.\nMR. GARRE: But, but again it's clear -- and\nit was not approved, and one of the reasons it wasn't\napproved was because rents weren't paid and he wasn't\nagreeing by the terms and conditions of the regulations\nwhich are part of the right-of-way. And that's at JA\n100.\nThe next point I wanted to make, Justice\nKennedy, is we agreed this would be a dramatic new\nextension of Bivens, and we agree with Justice Breyer,\nthe problems or types of litigations that this new\nconstitutional tort would create are really just -- the\n-- capable of the imagination.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Davis versus Passman is a\ndifferent context. But in theory is it consistent with\nwhat the Respondent asks?\nMR. GARRE: No, it's not. Because the\nRespondent here has more statutory and administrative\nremedies available to him than the plaintiff in Passman\ndid, including claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act\nfor trespasses, for any of the other alleged wrongs that\nyou've heard about here today. These were -- these were\nwrongs that were addressed by the IBLA and the APA.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But their argument\nis broader. It says you can't look at each little\npiece. You've got to look at the overall structure, and\noverall they are doing it to extort a property right\nthey don't want to pay for, and they are not doing --\nother people's cattle cross over and they don't\nprosecute them.\nNow, let's assume that's correct on the\nfacts. Are you saying that they have no remedy for that\ntype of extortionate activity?\nMR. GARRE: They don't have a Bivens remedy\nand they don't have a RICO remedy. I'd point the Court\nto Lujan versus National Wildlife Federation, where the\nCourt said that in that situation what a plaintiff must\ndo is challenge each administrative action individually,\nand the types of programmatic pattern challenges are for\nCongress, they're for executive branches; they are for\ninspector generals.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But what do you -- what do\nyou say to the argument that -- that you simply cannot\nfollow that logic ultimately, because when you get to\nthe point of the sort of the, you know, the death by a\nthousand cuts, which is what they are claiming here, you\ncan stitch up every cut, but by the time you get to a\nthousand, you're dead. I mean, they're making an\nargument that this is quantitatively so different that\nit is qualitatively different.\nMR. GARRE: I think the law and this Court\nreasonably assumes that where individuals have remedies\navailable to them through challenging individual --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why is that a reasonable\nassumption in response to their argument?\nMR. GARRE: It's reasonable to assume that\nif there are actions against United States under the\nFederal Tort Claims Act, or actions finding Government\nconduct unauthorized under the APA, that the Government\nwill take action to prevent that.\nHere every action that was challenged was\nfound to be appropriate and lawful under the existing\nregime. We would urge the Court to reverse.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
