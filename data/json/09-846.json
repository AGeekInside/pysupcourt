        "content": "(11:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument next in Case 09-846, United States v. Tohono\nO'Odham Nation.\nMr. Yang.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court in Keene held that section 1500\nof Title 28 deprives the Court Of Federal Claims has\njurisdiction when the plaintiff has a pending suit in\nanother court based on substantially the same operative\nfacts and left open the question whether some overlap in\nthe relief requested is also necessary to trigger that\nbar. The Federal Circuit erred in holding that section\n1500 applies when both suits -- only when both suits\nseek the same relief, and that the critical distinction\nin this regard is whether the particular relief in the\nplaintiff's plea for relief is deemed legal or\nequitable.\nSection 1500's text broadly bars CFC\njurisdiction whenever any suit that the plaintiff has\npending in any other court is a suit for the CFC claim\nor is merely a suit in respect to that claim. In other\nwords, another suit for a different but a related claim\nwill trigger section 1500.\nThat provision was intended to protect the\ngovernment from simultaneous duplicative suits against\nthe United States and its agents by forcing plaintiffs\nto elect between those related suits.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you recognize that\nsequential suits could be brought. So that if the case\nin the district court went to final judgment, then it\nwould be okay to go to the Court Of Federal Claims.\nMR. YANG: That is correct. In some, in\nperhaps a good number of cases, it's possible to, if you\nare seasonably prompt in your Court Of Federal Claims\ncase or your district court case first -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't have\ncontrol over how long the district court case is going\nto take, and there is no mechanism to stop the running\nof the statute of limitations.\nMR. YANG: Well, I think there is some\ncontrol that you can exercise over the -- how promptly\nthe suit proceeds. Particularly if we are talking about\nsuits against the government, many suits proceed on an\nadministrative record and go directly to summary\njudgment; that can be done in a relatively prompt\nmanner.\nBut even if not, the Congress that enacted\nsection 1500 in 1868 knew that essentially what it was\ndoing in many, many cases would prevent a second suit\nfrom going forward. That's because the Congress was\nconcerned with the cotton claimants. The cotton\nclaimants had authorization to bring suit in the Court\nof Claims, but there was a two-year statute of\nlimitations. That statute ran from the end of the Civil\nWar. And this Court in a case called U.S. v. Anderson\nat 76 U.S., and the relevant pages are 70 to 71, made\nclear that the end of the Civil War for the purposes of\nthat statute was August in 1866.\nCongress enacted section 1500 in June of\n1868. There was a two-month window, if that, to bring\nsuit and Congress recognized, it would have recognized,\nthat if you filed suit or were forced to elect at that\npoint, that would be the end of the game.\nThere was also another statutory provision\nthat Congress enacted during the Civil War that put a\ntwo-year statute of limitations on suits against\nofficers. That was discussed in this Court's decision,\nMitchell v. Clark, 110 U.S. 633 at pages 641 and 642.\nSo given the time at which Congress was\nenacting section 1500, it knew it was putting plaintiffs\nto a very hard choice. You had to elect between the\nCourt Of Federal Claims remedy and between a remedy in\nanother court against an officer. That remedy would\nlikely be the end of the game. And Congress did that in\na very particular way. It did it in a targeted statute\nthat limited the authority of the court that had its\nhands on the purse strings of the Federal Government,\nand that performed the very function that Congress just\na few years earlier had itself exercised through the\nenactment of private bills through its appropriations\npower.\nSo section 1500 ultimately states in essence\nthat if you are going to bring suit in this specialized\ncourt where Congress has vested the Court of Claims with\nthe very special power of distributing money from the\nFederal fisc, that you could only bring one suit arising\nfrom the same operative facts in order to be in that\ncourt.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's -\nyou just -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In the cotton cases, why\nisn't my reading of it quite very simple, which is\nCongress was concerned with ensuring that a claimant\ndidn't get double-recovered in two different suits.\nMR. YANG: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that a simple -\nyou know, you've got people suing in different\njurisdictions over getting the same pot of money or\nsomething close to it. Why isn't our view of 1500 just\nsimply you can't have two suits that are seeking the\nsame pot?\nMR. YANG: Well, it wasn't the same pot of\nmoney. The Abandoned and -- Abandoned Property\nCollection Act -- we will call it APCA -- provided for a\nspecial statutory trust remedy. That remedy was for the\nnet proceeds of anything -- any -- any auction sales\nthat might have resulted from cotton. If the cotton was\nlost, it was damaged, it was destroyed, if the proceeds\nwere paid but ultimately didn't make their way into the\nfisc, you got nothing or you got a substantially reduced\nfund. If you sued in court, you might be able to sue,\nas we explained in our reply brief, under certain\ndoctrines that would give you the property in specie, or\nyou could seek monetary relief. These are quite\ndifferent things. And even in -- it's not -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you couldn't get\nboth. I mean, that's I think Justice Sotomayor's point,\nabout duplication. It's not -- even if you can say,\nyes, it's a different mode of relief, but you could -\ncouldn't get -- I mean, suppose we didn't have 1500 and\nyou prevailed in your suit on the APCA or whatever you\ncall the statute. You could not then turn around and\nsue the government official, because you have the -- the\nsingle claim, you've been compensated.\nMR. YANG: I don't know -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not here -- it's\nquite different. I mean, one suit is not precluded by\nthe other. You -- you recognize that by saying you\ncould bring the Claims Court suit after the district\ncourt suit. That's not so in -- in the cotton cases.\nMR. YANG: You may in certain instances.\nBut particularly in the cotton cases, Congress knew that\nit -- what it was doing was forcing one path and only\none path. It wasn't about duplicative recovery. You\nhad to choose and you not -- you weren't going to have\ntime to bring another suit, and Congress would have\nknown that when it enacted the section 1500's\npredecessor two months before the statute ran in APCA\nand perhaps after the statute ran for bringing a tort\nsuit against officials under the cases -- the statute\nthat this Court construed in Mitchell.\nSo it wasn't simply that duplicative relief\nwas at issue, Congress was actually forcing you to make\na choice in cases where the types of relief are quite\ndifferent. And the type of relief, for instance, that\nyou would get in a suit against an agent of the United\nStates, what you get out of that suit is not a pot of\nmoney; the court does not say at the end of the case,\nhere you go, you asked for $1,000, here it is. The\ncourt enters an order; it enters a judgment. It says,\n\"Defendant, perhaps Tony Yang, officer of the\ngovernment, you pay $100 million, $50 million.\"\nIt doesn't mean much to the plaintiff if\nthey get at Tony Yang as an individual. This is very\ndifferent relief than a money judgment against the\nUnited States. It's not the same relief. And in fact,\nwe don't normally think of a claim as embodying a\nparticular type of relief, which is the submission of\nthe trial here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I'm not sure I\nunderstand your answer to my question. Assuming you had\na recovery under the -- for the -- confiscated cotton,\nunder the one route you had a recovery. You could not\nsue again under the other route without -- leaving aside\n1500, because the claim would be precluded.\nMR. YANG: That might have been true in one\ndirection but maybe not in the other. And let me\nexplain. The -- I'm not sure that there was an instance\nof this happening because of section 1500's existence,\nbut if you had, for instance, obtained damages against\nan individual agent in a suit and you still could have\nbrought suit within the Abandoned -- Abandoned Property\nCollection Act, the Abandoned Collection Property Act\nprovided a statutory trust for the owner of the cotton.\nIt's not at all clear that that would have been\nprecluded. There may well have been, but for the\nstatute of limitations problem, the ability to get a\ndouble recovery.\nBut nevertheless, I mean, our submission\nultimately turns on our understanding of the text of\nthis statute, which is quite broad. The text not only\nprecludes -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's\nnot -- it's not as broad as your test, \"arising out of\nthe same operative facts.\" It doesn't say that; it says\n\"any claim for and respect to which.\" And it seems to\nme that the facts of this case draw that precise\ndistinction. When you are asking for an accounting, you\nare not raising any claims about people doing anything\nbad at all. You are just saying, let me know what I've\ngot. And then when you bring a claim for -- for money\nbecause of mismanagement of the trust, that's -- that's\nquite different.\nMR. YANG: I -- that's -- that's true in\nsome cases of an accounting. It's not true on these\ncomplaints. The complaints here are -- they have the\nsense of a kitchen sink type of a pursuit of these\nclaims against the United States. The district court\ncase is not simply seeking an accounting of old money,\nas the Tribe submits. It actually alleges a whole slew\nof breaches, including the breach to -- to -- of failure\nto invest money properly, failing to put it to its\nhighest use, says the true balances would be far greater\nbut for these breaches.\nIt specifically seeks a -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that -- is that\nto assert the basis about why an accounting should be\nrequired?\nMR. YANG: No, because back -- the counts -\nthese are back on pages 90 and 91a of the petition\nappendix. The Tribe not only seeks an accounting, but\nit also seeks an order to comply with all other\nfiduciary duties determined by the court. This is\nparagraph 42.\nIt goes on to say that the tribe is not only\nentitled to object and essentially challenge the\naccounting, but it's entitled to any other equitable\nrelief that might be appropriate in light of the -- the\ncourt's decision in the case.\nSo the tribe is in no way trying in the\ndistrict court simply to seek an accounting. Just like\nin the Court of Federal Claims, it's not simply looking\nto what they claim to be new money. The specific\nallegations in the CFC complaint say that there has been\nno money for the -- no accounting for the revenue\ncollected.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what is the -\nmaybe I don't know enough about what an accounting is.\nBut why would it be other equitable relief to which they\nare entitled if they simply say, we want to know what\nwe've got?\nMR. YANG: The tribe -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they can get -\nand then it may be a basis for a further claim that, if\nthat's all we've got, where did the rest of it go, and\nthat might be the Court of Claims action. But it does\nstrike me that they are different -- claims for\ndifferent relief.\nMR. YANG: It -- it should be that way if\nthere were a narrowly tailored APA-type-like suit in\ndistrict court, but that's not this. The tribe's\ncomplaints both invoke, for instance, the Cobell\nlitigation which has been going on in -- in D.C. for\nquite some time, and are modeled on the same types of\nbroad claims that are at issue at Cobell.\nThis is not a simple case where there is\nagency action withheld and a court says: Agency, you\nhad X duty; do it. This is a -- a situation where the\ntribe is seeking to impose itself on age-old decisions\nthat have been made a long time ago and to seek to\nrevisit them and at the end of the day restate their\naccounts to reflect what they think should be in the\ntrust fund.\nThis parallels in both the Federal\nCircuit -- the Court of Federal Claims and the district\ncourt suit. There is substantial overlap in the\noperative facts. As the two judges -- the only two\njudges to have addressed this -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it accounting\nwhat should have been in the trust fund or what actually\nis? You say give me an accounting of the trust fund.\nDoes the officer go back and just add up the bank\naccounts and value the land and all that? Or -\nMR. YANG: Well, there's a difference -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- does he go back\nand say, well, this should be there but it's not?\nMR. YANG: The -- there is a difference\nbetween the parties, and I don't think it's been fully\nfleshed out here, about what an accounting is. The\nstatute at issue that the tribe invokes for the\naccounting in our view provides a prospective obligation\nfor the government to provide quarterly statements of\nwhat's coming in and out of the account going forward.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Going forward.\nMR. YANG: Going forward, not going back,\nand only with respect to moneys that were deposited or\ninvested under a specific statutory authority that\ninvolves deposits that were made in banks. So in our\nview -- you know, our view and the tribe's view I think\nare quite different in terms of what's at issue in the\ndistrict court case. And unfortunately, that's not the\ncase that's before you here. But what we're trying to\ndo is say whether or not there is substantial overlap\nbetween the two. And -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, are you at\ncross-purposes on those two issues? When it comes to\nwhat an accounting is, you want to say, oh, that's just\ngoing forward; when it comes to this 1500 question you\nwant to say they're the same as the money damages, which\ngoes backward?\nMR. YANG: No, I don't think we are at\ncross-purposes. What we are saying is what the\ncomplaint alleges. We don't control how the tribe seeks\nto assert rights. We think that the complaint may be\noverbroad, but that's not the correct question.\nI mean, this Court in Keene, for instance,\naddressed suits which had been dismissed because they\nwere improperly brought in district court, and those\nsuits in district court were sufficient to trigger\nsection 1500's jurisdictional bar simply because they\nwere asserting claims that overlapped with the claims\nthat were at issue in the CFC.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you read the claim in\nsection 1500 the same way that it should be -- or do you\nthink we should read it the same way in 1500 and\n12(b)(6), failure -\nMR. YANG: I think so. I mean -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Whether or not you've\nstated a claim upon which relief can be granted?\nMR. YANG: Right, which draws a distinction\nbetween the claim and the relief, right? If relief were\nthe particular type of relief, as the tribe asserts, the\nrule would simply say \"failure to state a claim,\"\nbecause you would have failed to state a certain\nelement, a necessary element, of the claim. Instead, it\nsays \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted.\"\nAnd I think that -- that keys into the other\nimportant provision of rule -- the Civil Rules for this\npurpose, which is Rule 54(c), which makes clear that the\nrelief that might be initially stated in a complaint is\nnot the relief that is at issue in the case.\nThe relief that comes at issue in the case\nis the relief that the -- that is proven, whether it be\nat summary judgment or at trial. And even if, for\ninstance, you ask for a dollar in damages in your\ncomplaint, it may well be that at trial you establish\nyour entitlement to injunctive relief or damages far in\nexcess.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But not so, not so here,\nbecause of the way Congress has set up the authority of\neach court. You could never -- what is it, 54(c) or -\nMR. YANG: (C).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: 54(c) is the relief to\nwhich you were entitled. The only relief to which you\nwere entitled in the one court, the Court of Claims, is\ncompensatory damages. So there isn't a question of some\nother form of relief. You have to go to another forum\nto get different relief.\nMR. YANG: Well, yes and no. The district\ncourt complaint, for instance -- and again, we contest\nthis, but they seek a restatement of their accounts.\nThey seek remedies such as equitable disgorgement and\nthe like. These are monetary remedies that go, again,\nto the same types of issues.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I also thought that the\nCourt of Claims could give -\nMR. YANG: All of these claims could be\nbrought -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could be brought -\nMR. YANG: -- in the Court of Claims.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They can give injunctive\nrelief where that's necessary.\nMR. YANG: That's correct, but if you have a\nclaim, for instance -- taking the old money/new money\nframework, which we don't think is borne out by the\ncomplaints, but even if we were correct, if they were\nseeking so-called old money in district court -- that\nis, money that should have been there, but was\nimproperly allocated and therefore didn't show up in\ntheir account -- they could also bring a claim under the\nIndian Tucker Act claiming that there was some breach of\nduty under a statute or regulation, clear and -- this is\na Navajo Nation-type question -- and you could get an\naccounting through -- in order to determine the proper\namount that should be there.\nSo this is a way -- the problem that we have\nhere, particularly in these cases where there's an\nallegation of 100 years of trust duties going back, and\nsimultaneously litigating these cases in courts that\nmight have different views on discovery obligations,\ndifferent views of the law on various point cases.\nOne of the cases that we cite in the\nappendix to the petition, the Ak-Chin case, the CFC\nordered discovery, for instance, that we have to conduct\na review of 33,000 boxes of materials from the archives.\nAlthough we claim there is an APA case going on in\ndistrict court, the plaintiffs are seeking discovery\nthere. We are fighting it. But this type of\nduplicative legislation and burden on the government is\nprecisely what Congress in 1868 said: If you are going\nto bring suit -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any instance\nyou've been able to think of where an Indian tribe could\nhave a claim for money of some kind and some other kind\nof relief that they seek where they couldn't get it all\nin the Court of Claims?\nMR. YANG: A declaratory judgment, for\ninstance. Some -- many -- some of these cases arise -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Declaratory judgment. Is\nthere anything else?\nMR. YANG: Um -- well, I mean, you wouldn't\nbe able to get injunctive relief.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No injunctive relief.\nMR. YANG: Not normally in the Court of\nClaims. There are exceptions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No matter what. Okay.\nWell, then they have a problem, because they might want\n-- they might want some money and they want an\ninjunction. So what are they supposed to do?\nMR. YANG: There is no question that section\n1500 may put a plaintiff at a difficult choice.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's a big choice.\nMR. YANG: It's a choice that has existed\nsince 1868, when Congress -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: To test that choice -\nit's pretty stark in the Casman case, where Congress\nsaid back pay is for the Claims Court, reinstatement for\nthe district court.\nBut your position is that under your reading\nof Casman -- let's forget about Congress's amendment.\nUnder your reading of the statute, the Casman decision\nwas wrong and the plaintiff had to choose either back\npay or reinstatement; there was no way to get both.\nMR. YANG: That's correct. And I think that\nwas this Court's suggestion at the end of Keene, when\nthe Court recognized that because there are complicated\njurisdictional regimes that apply when you sue the\ngovernment, the Court explained there may well be\nsituations where this precludes a plaintiff from seeking\nall the relief that you would otherwise be able to get\nif you could bring suit separately.\nAnd the Court in Keene said: Look, if there\nis apparent hardship -- this is following its decision\nin Corona Coal, which is 1924. If there is a hardship\nin the statute, it is a question that must be directed\nto Congress, because Congress is the one that set this\nup, this jurisdictional limit. And the jurisdictional\nlimit that existed in 1868, remember, was a very\ndifficult choice.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your basic point is this:\nYou're just saying it's too bad, go to Congress. But\nyou don't deny the basic point, which is that an Indian\ntribe may think the Bureau of Indian Affairs has really\nmismanaged everything and what they would like is some\nmoney, and also they want an injunction so they won't do\nit again.\nAnd now your view is, it's true, there is no\nway they can get that, because they have to go to two\ndifferent courts, and really in your view they can't go\nto two different courts, period.\nMR. YANG: Well, let me qualify -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And hardship is definite.\nIt's just you are saying, that's what Congress wanted.\nMR. YANG: The hardship may be there. The\nhardship is less now than it was in 1868 because of the\nlanguage of the statute -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why isn't it just as bad as\nwhat I just said?\nMR. YANG: Because you might be able to\nbring, for instance, an APA suit that completes before\nthe six-year statute of limitations ends. And frankly,\nwe don't think that that's an unusual thing, for an APA\naction to be brought promptly, even with an appeal. APA\nactions, again, if it's limited to the administrative\nrecord as they should, you can go straight to a summary\njudgment-like procedure -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have to extend a case\nthat I didn't agree with when it came out. You have to\nextend Bowen in order to achieve that. Does the\ngovernment want to extend Bowen?\nMR. YANG: No, no. I'm not suggesting that\nthat was a proper suit. But what you could do is you\ncould pursue it and it could complete and still be -\nthere would still be time to bring a suit in the Court\nof Federal -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You could complete it to a\ndenial of recovery?\nMR. YANG: Perhaps, that's right.\nWe think these suits -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that's any\ncomfort to the Indian tribe, do you?\nMR. YANG: Well, but that's precisely what\nthey are seeking to do here, and we just disagree\nwhether that relief is available in district court. And\nthe question here is whether you can simultaneously\npursue it.\nLet me be clear. These cases in our view\nshould almost all be brought normally in the Court of\nFederal Claims. These cases are seeking money for past\nactions and that's precisely what the Court of Federal\nClaims should address.\nHowever, a number of plaintiffs like to try\ntheir hand at more than one court and they bring\nsimultaneous suits, just as Tucker -- the cotton\nclaimants did in the 1860's, where Congress provided for\na general statute, very broadly worded. It applies to\nany claim for and in respect to which any suit or\nprocess is pending in any other court against the U.S.\nor any person acting or professing to act as its agents.\nIt's a very broad statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not -- I mean,\nyou are putting a pejorative spin on what they are\ndoing, saying, you know, many plaintiffs like to take a\nchance in more than one court. But your response to\nJustice Breyer suggests that that's a tough choice if\nyou have to choose between injunctive relief or damages.\nThat's not them trying to, you know, get the same -\ntake two bites at the apple.\nMR. YANG: In some cases, it's is a tough\nchoice. Casman would have been a very difficult choice.\nBut as this Court suggested in Keene, the question goes\nto Congress, and when Congress addressed the question it\ndecided relief of that sort should be brought all in the\nCourt of Claims.\nBut in this case, this is not a case where\nwe think particular hardship would be had, because the\ntribe could pursue its claims in the Court of Federal\nClaims and probably should be doing that if it simply -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why isn't our rule\nsimply -- what is so wrong with a rule that says if you\ncan bring it in the Court of Claims you have to, but if\nthere's relief that you can't secure there you can have\ntwo lawsuits? What is so irrational about that?\nMR. YANG: Well, that doesn't square -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If there is no double\nrecovery possible.\nMR. YANG: But that doesn't square even with\nthe history of what Congress is trying to target. The\nrelief that was available in the Court of Claims in the\n1860's in the Abandoned Property Collection Act was a\nvery limited -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We have already gone\nthrough that because most of those claims would have had\nsome element of double recovery, that might have\nprecluded a second action. The point that I raised was\nif there is a chance of potential double recovery, you\ncan't breach, what's wrong with that?\nMR. YANG: I don't think it squares with the\ntext of the statute, which is broader than, doesn't\nprovide for a claim, it doesn't provide for relief, it\ndoesn't speak to double recovery. If Congress was\nintending to target that specific problem it could have\ndone so in a much direct manner.\nMr. Chief Justice, I would like to reserve\nthe remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Yang.\nMs. Spinelli.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. SPINELLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nTwo suits are for or in respect to the same\nclaim under Section 1500, only if they stem from the\nsame operative facts and seek duplicative relief. And\nin response to the Government's argument, I would like\nto explain why that's the best reading of Section 1500's\ntext, as well as the only reading that harmonizes\nSection 1500 with the overall jurisdictional and\nremedial scheme.\nCongress has made a broad range of remedies\navailable to Plaintiffs wronged by the Government. And\nit's directed Plaintiffs to seek certain remedies only\nin the Court of Federal Claims, and certain remedies\nonly in the district court.\nThe Government's reading of Section 1500\nassumes that Congress intended to penalize Plaintiffs\nfor following that direction by barring them from the\nonly forum where they can obtain money damages. But\nnothing in the statute's text or history suggests that\nCongress intended to create such a nonsensical scheme.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your argument assumes that\nthere is available in the district courts injunctive\nrelief under the Administrative Procedure Act, and that\nis far from clear, even after Bowen, it's far from clear\nif you had any business being in the district court\nanyway. And so in a way we are resolving a very strange\nquestion, that is if as is not clear, you have a right\nto sue in the district courts for an injunction, can\nthat suit proceed because of 1500 when there is a suit\npending in the Court of Claims and that is sort of an\nabstract question.\nMS. SPINELLI: Justice Scalia, it is\ndisputed whether or not the district court has\njurisdiction to entertain the Nation's claims there.\nThe Government has a move to dismiss on that ground,\nthat motion is pending. We don't believe that the\ndistrict court's jurisdiction over the claims raised in\nthe district court is a question that this Court needs\nto face. Rather, the question here is whether the Court\nof Federal Claims has jurisdiction over the claims\nbrought in the CFC. And that turns not on whether the\ndistrict court has jurisdiction, but on whether\nduplicative relief is sought in both suits.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The main thrust that I was\nraising was does this really get the Tribe into trouble?\nThey have to forego one kind of relief for another. So\nwhat about injunctive relief, that's what he thought of,\nand Justice Scalia raises the point, well, they are not\ngoing to be entitled to injunctive relief anyway because\nthe APA doesn't provide it, if I understand that\ncorrectly. So you are giving up the null set. You were\ngiving up the null set.\nMS. SPINELLI: No, not at all,\nJustice Breyer. First of all, we would contest that we\nare not entitled to the relief that the Nation sought in\nthe district court. We believe that the Nation is\nentitled to that relief.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it couldn't get that?\nMS. SPINELLI: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It couldn't get that kind\nof relief in the Court of Claims?\nMS. SPINELLI: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, it could.\nMS. SPINELLI: No, no, no. You are right\nthat it could not. The relief that is being sought in\nthe district court is primarily an accounting. An\naccounting is inherently an equitable remedy, a remedy\nthat under trust law the trustee owes to the beneficiary\nto provide the beneficiary with all the information\nnecessary for him to protect his rights.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't it well established\nthat part of the jurisdiction of the equity court when\nit requires an accounting is to give damages for breach\nof the trustee's duty? That's Hornbook.\nMS. SPINELLI: That may well be the case,\nJustice Kennedy, in common law trust suits. That wasn't\nrequested -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, I'm talking about\nhistorically in equity. No. Historically in equity the\ntrustee who breaches the trustee's duty in the equity\ncourt is required to give damages.\nMS. SPINELLI: You are correct that\nnormally, that in the past -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not common law, it's\nnot common law, it's equity. It's old law, it's equity.\nMS. SPINELLI: Correct. You are correct\nthat in the days of the divided bench suit for breach of\ntrust were brought in equity. I don't think we need to\nparse that finely here, because the question here is\nwhether or not the Tribe has sought duplicative relief\nin both courts.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that unrealistic?\nYou don't want an accounting for the sake of having an\naccounting so that you can put the accounting in your\ndesk. Oh, look it, they stole $1,000,000,000 from us.\nYou want to get the $1,000,000,000. If the suits are\ndirected at the same object, and it is fanciful to think\nthere is this separate suit for an accounting. The\nobject of that suit is the same thing as the object of\nthe suit in the Court of Claims.\nMS. SPINELLI: With respect, Justice Scalia,\nthat is not the case. The accounting has enormous\nbenefit entirely apart from any monetary relief that it\nmight ultimately lead to. The Nation, as well as other\ntribes who have brought these kinds of suits, lack basic\ninformation about what they own, what the metes and\nbounds of their lands are, what leases have been\ngranted, how long they last, what easements and rights\nof way have been granted over their land, what the\nstatus is of their mineral rights and timber rights.\nAll of this is information that the Tribe needs and that\nCongress recognized in the Indian Trust Fund Management\nReform Act that the Tribe needs in order to exercise its\nFederally granted right to decide how it's assets are\nbest managed, and the longer that that accounting is\ndelayed, the more the Nation is harmed by the inability\nto do that, the inability to decide whether certain\nfunds should be withdrawn from trusts held by the United\nStates, the inability to decide whether it should bring\nclaims against third-parties. So there's real value to\nthe accounting that's entirely separate from any\nmonetary relief. And the accounting is not sought in\nthe Court of Federal Claims. The Court of Federal\nClaims has long held that it lacks jurisdiction to grant\nthat kind of pre-liability historical accounting.\nAlthough -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you get the\naccounting in conjunction with the claim of damages?\nMaybe the Court of Federal Claims, you can't go there\nand say, look, I want an accounting, but you can say I\nhave been wronged over the century and I would like to\nfind out to what extent, and before you can figure that\nout you actually have to have an accounting. Can't the\nCourt of Federal Claims get an accounting in that\ncontext?\nMS. SPINELLI: The Court of Federal Claims\ncan order something called an accounting in aid of\njudgment. Despite the similar terminology, they are not\nat all the same. An accounting of the type that's being\nsought in the district court is a remedy by itself.\nIt's a remedy that the beneficiary is entitled to once\nits received or denied, that's a final order that can be\nappealed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. It's a\nremedy, but is it terribly different from what the\naccounting the Court of Federal Claims would order to\nfigure out how much -\nMS. SPINELLI: It is because it requires the\ntrustee to provide all information about the trust that\nmight be relevant to the beneficiary, and it does so\nwithout requiring the beneficiary to prove any\nmismanagement. By contrast -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Were those accountings\navailable before the Administrative Procedure Act was\npassed? Is the jurisdictional basis for that the waiver\nof sovereign immunity that allows you to demand an\naccounting from the United States? Is that just the\nAPA?\nMS. SPINELLI: The waiver of sovereign\nimmunity that is being asserted in the district court is\nthe APA, that's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about this -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you didn't have a right\nto that before the APA was passed?\nMS. SPINELLI: In the district court, no.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Either in the district\ncourt nor in the Court of Claims. So this is not an\nunthinkable situation, is it?\nMS. SPINELLI: It's a little bit more\ncomplicated -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was thought about for a\ncentury, anyway.\nMS. SPINELLI: It's a little bit more\ncomplicated than that because prior to -- prior to the\nCourt of Federal Claims in its current incarnation,\ncertain claims for an accounting could have been brought\nbefore the Indian Claims Commission, but -- I mean\nthat's going a little far afield. The -- at any rate\nCongress has now recognized specifically by statute that\nthis is something that Tribes need, and that's the right\nthat the Nation is seeking to enforce in the district\ncourt action.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why have -- you say\nCongress has specifically recognized it by statute.\nYou're referring to the APA?\nMS. SPINELLI: No, I'm referring to the 1994\nIndian Trust Fund Management Reform Act, which\nspecifically required the Department of the Interior to\nprovide Tribal beneficiaries with certain statements,\ncertain accountings regarding their -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But did not provide for a\nlawsuit against -- against the government.\nMS. SPINELLI: They did not -- they did not\nexpressly do so, no.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: When you are in the CFC,\ndon't you get -- you aren't you asking for compensation\nfor losses and injuries from the commingling or the\nmisappropriation of assets?\nMS. SPINELLI: No, Justice Kennedy, in the\nCourt of Federal Claims, as a close reading of the\ncomplaint will show, the Nation is requesting four\nspecific kinds of relief. First it's asking for damages\nfrom the United States' failure to lease its mineral\nrights for fair market value. That's count 1. Count 2\nis seeking damages from the United States' failure to\nobtain fair market value for leases of its land. Count\n3 is seeking damages from the United States' failure to\ninvest judgment funds in a timely way and to obtain the\nmaximum interest rate; and count 4 asserts a similar\nclaim for damages with respect to the trust fund.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But your brief makes the\n-- seems to make the point that that's all just interest\non capital. It's not for lost capital. But even as you\ndescribed it, it sounds to me that you get damages for\nloss of capital plus interest.\nMS. SPINELLI: It's -- it's not just\ninterest, you are correct. I mean, maybe if I give an\nexample this will make things a little bit clearer. Say\nthat the government sold a stand of timber belonging to\nthe Nation for $20, even though the stand of timber was\nworth $40. It then deposited it into the trust account,\n$10.\nThe suit in the district court seeks an\naccounting and a restatement of the accounts and to the\nextent appropriate and available, equitable restitution\nof the $10 that was missing from the account.\nThe suit in the CFC seeks to recover the $20\nthat the United States should have earned, had it acted\nas a prudent fiduciary when it was selling the stand of\ntimber. And the Nation is entitled to both sums of\nmoney, but they are different, and because the money\nsought in the two courts is different, the relief is not\nduplicative.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My problem is that I read\nthe CFC complaint as including both. I will take a look\nat it. And I intruded on Justice Breyer's question.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I'm trying to work out\nstill in my mind, is if you say, look, Indian Tribe:\nYou have to go to the court of claims, period. Period.\nYou can't go to these other courts, I mean unless you\ngive up the court of claims. Is the Indian Tribe going\nto really lose something it needs?\nMS. SPINELLI: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know you think yes. I\nrealize that.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: And, what I want to ask you\nabout -\nMS. SPINELLI: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is in section 2 -\nMS. SPINELLI: I apologize.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- of 1491 there is a\nsentence which says, about the court of claims, in any\ncase including the 1505 Tucker Act, the court shall have\nthe power to remand appropriate matters to any\nadministrative or executive body or official with such\ndirection as it is may deem proper and just.\nNow that seems awfully broad, so I'm\nthinking now, if they want money, they can get the money\nfrom the court of claims. If they want something like\nan injunction, they could ask the court of claims, tell\nthe executive branch to behave the way we think they\nhave to under the law and there's your authority.\nMS. SPINELLI: Justice Breyer -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm just quoting. Now\nwhat's -- I want to know the response.\nMS. SPINELLI: Justice Breyer, you're -- you\nare exactly right about what 1491(a)(2) provides, but it\nalso provides that any such relief can be ordered only\nas an incident of and collateral to a judgment of a\nclaim of which the Court of Federal Claims otherwise has\njurisdiction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you want money; that\ncauses the problem. If you don't want any money, you\ndon't have a problem. You Just forget about it.\nMS. SPINELLI: And notwithstanding this\nlanguage -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMS. SPINELLI: -- the court of claims has\ncontinued to hold that it lacks jurisdiction to grant an\nequitable pre-liability accounting. All that it can do\nis after liability for certain acts of mismanagement has\nbeen proven, calculate damages for those specific acts\nof mismanagement. Now -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure I\nunderstand. You could not bring in the court of claims\nthe old money claims, and why? That the government\nmismanaged -\nMS. SPINELLI: Well, two -- two things,\nJustice Sotomayor. We believe that the Nation could not\nbring the old money claims in the Court of Federal\nClaims because it has held repeatedly that it lacks\njurisdiction to grant an equitable accounting. However,\nI don't believe the answer to that question matters,\nbecause the issue here is not -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It does, because why\ncouldn't you simply have said, they owe us that original\nextra 10 bucks -- $10, and we want it? What -- what -\nMS. SPINELLI: Dividing -- well, it is clear\nthat the accounting sought in the district court\ncouldn't have been obtained in the court of claims. And\nit made sense to seek the old money as the court of\nappeals called it, in conjunction with the accounting,\nbecause the accounting is what should reveal what is\nmissing from the account. And that's the reason, and\nnot for any manipulative or forum-shopping purpose, that\nthe Nation split its complaint the way it did.\nNow to be sure, there is some fuzziness\nabout the jurisdictional line between the Court of\nFederal Claims and the district court. There is no\ndoubt about that. The Nation did its best to negotiate\nthat and filed its complaints in good faith. We believe\nthat that question doesn't need to be addressed by this\nCourt, because the only question section 1500 asks is\nwhether the two suits are for or in respect to the same\nclaim, by which we think it means are they for or in\nrespect to the same demand for relief. Here -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The government says the\nstatute is simple. It says you can't have two suits\nsimultaneously, or you can't when the CFC suit is the -\nthe second one.\nAnd Mr. Yang told me that yes, the\ngovernment thinks that in the Casman case there was a\nchoice, you can sue for reinstatement in the district\ncourt, you can sue for back pay in the claims court, but\nyou cannot get both. And when Congress realized that\nthat's what was happening, Congress did not adopt a\ntwo -- didn't bless the two-state -- two court solution.\nCongress said, there will be one lawsuit. It will all\nbe in the claims court, and they can grant both the back\npay and the reinstatement.\nSo the two-suit approach was rejected, I\nguess, in -- in Congress's response to Casman.\nMS. SPINELLI: With respect,\nJustice Ginsburg, I would disagree. I think that action\nby Congress in the 1972 Remand Act strongly supports the\nconclusion that Congress has implicitly acquiesced in\nthis construction of section 1500.\nCongress -- you are right, Congress decided\nnot to say go ahead with your two suits in two different\ncourts. It thought that was too burdensome for the\nplaintiff; rather it amended the Tucker Act to permit\nthe plaintiff to pursue both remedies in the Court of\nFederal Claims. But that shows that Congress was well\naware of the Casman holding, and it did not make any\nchange to the statute to cast the holding into doubt,\nthat where two remedies are available in two different\ncourts, one can pursue them by bringing simultaneous\nsuits in the two different courts.\nAll that it did is make it easier for\nplaintiffs in that specific situation to get full\nrelief. Beyond that, in 1982 -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, excuse me, it didn't\nmake it easier. You -- you had to bring them both in\nthe court of claims, no? You didn't still have the\noption of -- of still bringing two different suits, did\nyou?\nMS. SPINELLI: No, I think after -- after\nthe amendment -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You had to go to the court\nof claims.\nMS. SPINELLI: Yes. I mean, other -\notherwise that would raise a claim-splitting problem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but if they were just\nmaking it easier, they -- they would have said, you\nknow, you can do either one.\nMS. SPINELLI: Well, I mean, clearly the\neasier path is to have one suit. I don't think any\nplaintiff wants to be forced to bring two suits to\nobtain two different remedies, both of which it needs,\nat double the expense and, you know, double the anxiety.\nBut I think what's significant about the\n1972 action is that Congress did absolutely nothing to\nsuggest that it disagreed with the Casman holding. And\nthe same is true in 1982, when Congress completely\nrevamped the entire jurisdictional scheme, changed the\njurisdiction of the claims court very much, and yet left\nsection 1500 entirely untouched. And that makes sense.\nI mean, just to turn to the text for a minute, the key\nword, as I think this Court said in Keene, is the word\n\"claim.\"\n\"Claim\" can mean a lot of different things.\nIt can sometimes mean the set of operative facts from\nwhich a right to relief arises, which I believe is at\nleast implicitly what the government is saying. It can\nalso mean a demand for relief; for instance, in this\nCourt's cases regarding Article 3 standing, it's\nroutinely said that plaintiff has to establish standing\nseparately for each claim, which means for each form of\nrelief sought.\nThe reason that is the correct reading of\nsection 1500 is because of the nature of the\njurisdictional scheme. The Court of Federal Claims has\nalways been a court of limited jurisdiction. It can\nonly grant certain remedies, primarily money damages.\nAnd the word \"claim\" in the Tucker Act and its\npredecessors, from the very beginning, prior to the\nenactment of section 1500, has been read by this Court\nto mean a demand for relief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That would be\ninconsistent with the definition of \"claim\" in the\nfederal rules, I think.\nMS. SPINELLI: Yes, I think the definition\nof \"claim\" in the federal rules -- I think that's a\ndifferent definition of \"claim.\" I think what we have\nhere is a narrower definition that was first established\nin the 19th century through this Court's decisions\nconstruing the Tucker Act and its predecessors.\nGiven that the word \"claim\" in the Tucker\nAct carries that narrow meaning, it certainly makes\nsense to construe the word \"claim\" in section 1500 as\nhaving the same meaning.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you give it that narrow\nmeaning, however, the government says you are\ncontradicting what was the case with regard to the\ncotton suits. That, in fact, some of them were asking\nfor funds from this -- money from this common fund, and\nothers were seeking relief against the individuals who\nhad taken the cotton or replanted the cotton. Those are\ndifferent claims, as you define \"claim,\" anyway.\nMS. SPINELLI: I don't think that is our\ndefinition of \"claim,\" but let me explain.\nWe don't dispute that certain cotton\nclaimants, you know, brought writs of conversion of\ntrespass. Some may have brought writs of replevin or\ndetinue seeking the cotton itself back. The relevant\nfact is that the suit saying \"I want my 100 bales of\ncotton back\" and the suit saying \"I would like money to\ncompensate me for my loss of 100 bales of cotton\" seek\nduplicative relief. And -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That is different from the\nword \"claim.\" I mean, if you are hanging the whole\nthing on the word \"claim,\" you gave me a very plausible\nalternate definition of \"claim.\" But your case does not\nfollow that. Your case hinges on duplicative relief,\nwhich is something quite different. I don't know any\ndefinition of \"claim\" that is synonymous with\nduplicative relief.\nMS. SPINELLI: The word \"claim\" in section\n1500 refers to claims over which the Court of Federal\nClaims has jurisdiction, just as it does in the Tucker\nAct. There is no express limitation in the Tucker Act\non the relief that can be granted. The word \"claim\" has\nbeen read implicitly to incorporate a limitation on the\nkind of relief that can be granted.\nTherefore, in section 1500, a suit for or in\nrespect to a claim in the Court of Federal Claims must\nmean a suit for or in respect to a demand for relief\nthat the Court of Claims can grant, and where\nduplicative relief is being sought, that falls within\nthe language of the statute. It falls within the\noverall jurisdictional scheme which directs plaintiffs\nto bring suits for different relief in different courts,\nand it also appears with cotton claimants.\nThe cotton claimants were seeking\nduplicative relief, and that's the concern that Congress\naimed at. Congress was not faced in 1868 with a\nsituation in which plaintiffs had been directed to seek\ndifferent non-duplicative remedies, remedies that\nweren't substitutes for one another but complimented one\nanother in two different courts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I had under the impression\nthat sometimes they sued for some money out of a fund,\nwhich would have been partial, and other times they sued\nfor the value of the cotton, and other times they sued\nfor the cotton itself, which in certain circumstances\ncould have been worth a lot more. By the time of suit,\nit went up. I mean, do we know it was always\nduplicative in those cotton suits?\nMS. SPINELLI: I believe we do know it was\nalways duplicative, notwithstanding the fact that the\namount that one might recover might differ.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if the amount\ndiffers, then, why do you suppose the cotton belonged to\nthe Indian Tribe? On the one hand, they want an\naccounting out of the money ever earned out of this\ncotton in the past and on the other hand, they want what\nthe cotton is worth in the future on the -\nMS. SPINELLI: That is not -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's Justice Scalia's\nquestion.\nMS. SPINELLI: That is not duplicative.\nWhat is duplicative is a remedy that is either the same,\nor a remedy that serves as a substitute for another\nremedy. And what this Court has said, though, is that\neven if it's not a completely full substitute -- even\nif, say, the damages sought in one court are less than\nthe damages sought in another -- if they are duplicative\nrelief for the same injury, they are barred by section\n1500. And I think that is completely consistent with\nthe holding in Keene.\nIn Keene, the plaintiff was bringing\nmultiple suits against the United States in different\ncourts for duplicative relief, money, and compensation\nfor funds it had paid out to asbestos claimants. And\nnotwithstanding the fact that it brought some of those\nsuits on a contract theory and some of those suits on an\nequitable tort theory of indemnification, the statute\nbarred those. But Keene was not faced with a situation\nin which the plaintiffs were forced, as in Casman, to\nproceed in two different courts to obtain different\nrelief.\nAnd another particularly good example is an\nexample of a regulatory taking suit, in which if a\nplaintiff wants to challenge the legality of government\nregulation affecting his property, he needs to do that\nin the district court under the APA. And according to\nthe government, he cannot bring a suit for just\ncompensation in the Court of Federal Claims until that\ndistrict court suit is completed and any appeal is\ncompleted and any cert petition is completed, by which\ntime the six-year statute of limitations on the just\ncompensation claim may very well have expired.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But in your case -- now,\nlet's assume the government prevails. You go to the\nCFC, and you prevail on everything. You get all the\nfindings in your favor and so forth. There is some\nrelief that you don't get.\nI take it, unless I am missing something,\nthat you could then, after the CFC suit is finished, go\nto district court and say: Now we want this added\nprotection, this added relief.\nMS. SPINELLI: The reason -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the statute wouldn't\nhave run generally, because if you are seeking the\ninjunction, it's only latches bars you, and you are not\nbarred by latches because you couldn't have gone sooner.\nMS. SPINELLI: There are a couple of reasons\nwhy that doesn't work, Justice Kennedy. First of all,\nthe Nation needs the accounting now. I mean, it's as if\nin Casman, Casman had been told, well, you know, first\nget reinstated -- I'm sorry -- first get your backpay;\nthen go get reinstated. He needs his -- the Nation\nneeds the accounting now, not later. In addition, if it\nwere the case that the accounting uncovered additional\nmismanagement, this statute of limitations, the six-year\nstatute of limitations might well expire while the\ndistrict court suit for an accounting is pending, those\nsuits tend to last a very long time. Indeed in the\nIndian Claims Commission they have been known to last\nfor up to 50 years. And it would force the Nation to\nrun the risk of losing its right to damages. We don't\nbelieve that's what Congress had in mind. It doesn't\nharmonize Section 1500 with the remainder of the\nstatutory scheme. It's not mandated by the history of\nthe statute, and it simply doesn't make sense.\nUnless there are further questions, we ask\nfor the judgment be affirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Yang, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. YANG: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe Tribe is unable to identify a textual\nbasis for its same relief defense to the court of\nfederal claims. If it's definition of claim is as\nnarrow and circumscribed as it defines, it wouldn't\ncapture the cotton claim. Moreover, putting aside the\ndefinition of claim, the statute applies when there is a\npending suit or process in another court. That is not\nonly for the claim, but in respect to the claim. That\nsubstantially broadens the statute.\nTwo, there are two problems with the same\nrelief test that's as a practical matter. In order to\ndetermine whether the same relief is being sought in the\nother court, which is the relevant question under their\ntest, you have to ask, what relief would be sought in\ndistrict court. But Rule 54(c) makes clear that the\nrelief which is available in district court is not\nspecified by the complaint, it's whatever develops\nthrough the case. So you might not know until the very\nend whether duplicative relief is being sought.\nSecondly, if you are going to limit the\nrelief that is available in the district court based on\nwhat the court of claims' view is of the district\ncourt's jurisdiction to issue relief, you are inviting\nthe court of federal claims and the federal circuit to\nbe opining on the jurisdiction of the district court\nunder the APA, in very complicated cases which involve\nquestions of Bowen, Utah Wilderness, this is not the way\nthat you would construe normally a jurisdictional\nstatute.\nThe specter of 50-year old suits proceeding\nsimultaneously in the court of federal claims in\ndistrict court certainly would have motivated, or spoken\nto the Congress that enacted Section 1500's predecessor\nin 1868.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree with\nyour friend that there are differences between the\naccounting you can get in the district court and the\naccounting you can get in the court of federal claims as\na prelude to monetary damages?\nMR. YANG: I'm not exactly sure the\ndifferences that they are pointing to. There are\ndifferences in terms of the procedure and what is a\nrelief. The other you would have to show that there was\nsome kind of a breach and you get a full kind of\naccounting to quantify damages that relate -- in aid of\njudgment. But at the end of the day, the example,\nlosing $10 and you collect 20 but only debit -- put 10\non the books, that is a claim which is cognizable in the\ncourt of federal claims if they have a money mandating\nstatute of regulations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They don't even know who\nhas hunting leases and -\nMR. YANG: That's what discovery -- that's\nwhat discovery is for. The Ak-Chin case, for instance.\n33,000 boxes of discovery we have to go through in terms\nof a discovery request in the court of federal claims.\nThis is done -- this is the way cases normally proceed.\nThey do not proceed on dual tracks where the very\npremise of liability in the court of federal claims is\nbeing litigated in district court, or they are seeking\nto challenge, you know, an accounting. Accounting\nnormally would be, you know, here's an account of\nyour -- your assets, but they're seeking to challenge\nit. If you went back to equity, for instance. A\ntrustee does, as an equitable matter, have a duty to\naccount when requested. But the cost of the accounting\nis taken out of the trust corpus. That's not what is\ngoing on here. They are trying to seek to use the APA\nto force something which we don't think is authorized\nunder statute as a secondary means of discovery for the\nsame claims that are at issue in the court of federal\nclaims. That type of duplicative litigation and the\nburden on the federal courts is precisely what Section\n1500 was intended to prevent against, and in the absence\nof a textual basis for the same relief test that the\ncourt of federal claims or federal circuit adopted here\nI think is fatal to the case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the accounting doesn't\ncome out of the trust corpus if there is misfeasance,\nthe trustee has to pay the damages for that?\nMR. YANG: I can't speak to that,\nJustice Kennedy, that is possible. I'm just not that\nversed in equity jurisprudence to be able to give you a\ndefinitive answer.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the Loveladies\nsituation?\nMR. YANG: In Loveladies, if I may answer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMR. YANG: Loveladies involved a district\ncourt claim for a declaration that the action wasn't\ntaken. The district court taking declaration which was\nultimately disposed of, but at the same time that\nLoveladies was seeking does assert a claim for just\ncompensation in the court of federal claims.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Yang,\n"
