        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 00-1089, Toyota Motor Manufacturing v. Ella\nWilliams.\nMr. Roberts.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe Sixth Circuit below held that the\nrespondent, Ms. Williams, was substantially limited in\nperforming manual tasks and therefore disabled under the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act because she could not\nperform the manual tasks associated with her assembly line\njob, specifically gripping a sponge and repetitively\nwiping down cars with her arms at shoulder level for an\nextended period of time.\nThat test for disability status was wrong. It\nwas wrong because it is inconsistent with the statute\nwhich requires a substantial limitation on a major life\nactivity. Repetitively wiping down cars with arms at\nshoulder level for an extended period of time is not a\nmajor life activity, and being limited in that activity\ndoes not constitute being substantially limited in the\nmajor life activity of performing manual tasks in general.\nA plaintiff must show a substantial limitation\nin a broad range of manual tasks to meet the statutory\nstandard. The most that the court of appeals could\nextrapolate was that Ms. Williams was substantially\nlimited in the tasks associated with jobs that required\ngripping tools and repetitive activity with arms at\nshoulder level for an extended period of time. That is a\nspecialized and idiosyncratic limitation. It is not a\nsubstantial limitation --\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, can I just ask you at\nthe outset, so you have plenty of time to comment, there's\nexpert testimony, as I read the briefs, that -- on your\nopponent's side that she suffers a lack of access to the\nlabor market of from 50 to 55 percent of the jobs, both\nnationwide and in Kentucky.\nMR. ROBERTS: A number of things about that.\nFirst, that was not pertinent on the manual tasks inquiry.\nThat was submitted under the major life activity of\nworking in an effort to show a substantial limitation as\nto working. The district court rejected that limitation.\nThe court of appeals did not reach it.\nThe district court rejected it for a number of\nreasons. First, the 50 to 55 percent was based largely on\nthe assumption that she -- she could not do medium duty\nwork, but as the evidence showed -- and I would point\nparticularly to page 24 of Dr. Weikel's deposition -- she\nnever established that she could do medium duty work in\nthe first place and had never done medium duty work. And\nwhat Dr. Weikel said is, if you take out that loss -- in\nother words, the loss of eliminating medium duty work --\nher loss of jobs goes down to 10 to 15 percent, which\nwould not be sufficient to show a substantial limitation\nin working.\nThe district court also said that that evidence\nwas not geographically specific enough. It was based on\nnational figures and it was not narrowed down to the\nparticular job market, so that the -- the evidence was\nproperly rejected by the district court and never reached\nby the court of appeals because it was submitted on the\nworking life activity and not the manual tasks.\nQUESTION: When you say it was rejected by the\ndistrict court, you don't mean it was inadmissible. You\nmean it was given no weight by the district court.\nMR. ROBERTS: The district court considered it\nand said it was not probative of what it purported to\nshow, a loss of access to the job market. She failed to\n-- to meet the test for working because she didn't show an\nexclusion from a class of jobs. All she showed was that\nsome assembly line jobs were closed to her. That was the\nmain reason.\nThe other reason was because the evidence that\nshe showed wasn't probative of what it purported to show,\nagain an issue that the court of appeals did not reach.\nWhat the court of appeals erred in doing was\nartificially narrowing the manual tasks inquiry. It said\nquite clearly it was adopting a class-based analysis.\nWe're only going to look at the manual tasks associated\nwith your job.\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, in the same vein as\nJustice Stevens' question, how does the worker's\ncompensation notion of disability fit in? As I understand\nit, she was assessed as having a 20 percent -- what was it\n-- partial disability for worker's compensation purposes.\nSo, that's another statutory scheme -- uses the same\nconcept, disability.\nMR. ROBERTS: But -- but pursuant to very\ndifferent standards. And there are two worker's\ncompensation proceedings. The first one, before she was\nrotated into this new job, was the 20 percent that Your\nHonor referred to. The second one, she sought worker's\ncompensation also after this one, and that was denied in\n-- in a denial affirmed by the Kentucky Supreme Court.\nBut there are different standards. Worker's\ncompensation is looking to very different things than --\nthan the Americans with Disabilities Act. And under the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, you have to show a\nsubstantial limitation on a major life activity. That's\nnot the standard --\nQUESTION: Well, why wouldn't 20 percent\nlimitation -- 20 percent occupational impairment be a\nsubstantial limitation?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, first of all, it may be\npertinent if the standards were the same, but only under\nthe working category. The worker's compensation system is\nlooking to impact on work. The court of appeals analysis\nwas under the performing manual tasks category. But\nagain --\nQUESTION: Why did the court of appeals avoid\naddressing the work approach? Was it because it thought\nthis Court had rejected that?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, a couple of reasons. My\nbrother, the respondent's counsel, represented to the\nSixth Circuit that the strongest claim was under\nperforming manual tasks and not under working, and a\nrecent Sixth Circuit precedent, the McKay case, I think\nmade it quite clear that she would not qualify as\nsubstantially limited in the major life activity of\nworking.\nQUESTION: Should we address that, or because it\nwas not addressed below, leave that alone?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, I think the more typical\napproach would be not to address the major life activity\nof working since it was not addressed below, except to\nthis extent. The major problem with what the Sixth\nCircuit did in looking only at the manual tasks associated\nwith working replicates, under that category, all of the\nproblems that this Court has noted or the concerns,\nrather, that this Court has noted with respect to the\nmajor life activity of working. The test is circular.\nQUESTION: In -- in looking at a substantial\nlimitation, do we focus on the things that the person\ncannot do or the things they still can do or both? What\ndo we do?\nMR. ROBERTS: Certainly with respect to manual\ntasks, you have to look at both because it's not enough,\nobviously, to say there's one particular manual task that\nI can't do. That wouldn't show a substantial limitation,\nand that particular manual task is probably not going to\nbe a major life activity. So, you have to look at the\nbroad range.\nAnd that is what the courts of appeals have\ndone. They've taken a list of everyday manual tasks that\nwe all perform and said, well, where does the plaintiff\nfall in this -- in this -- against this list of everyday\ntasks? The Sixth Circuit did not do that. They looked\njust at the work-related activities.\nWhen you do that, the record is quite clear that\nMs. Williams can do a broad range of manual tasks. With\nrespect to personal hygiene, she can brush her teeth, wash\nher face, bathe. With respect to everyday activities\naround the house, the record shows she makes breakfast,\ncan cook, laundry, pick up and organize around the house.\nAnd, of course, what the district court, in particular,\nfound most compelling, she can do assembly line work at\nthe Toyota plant.\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, may I just stop you on\nsomething you just said? I thought the Sixth Circuit said\nin its opinion that it had considered recreation,\nhousehold chores, living generally, as well as the work-\nrelated impairments.\nMR. ROBERTS: A very important sentence that I\nthink has to be read carefully. In the first place, it\ndoesn't say that we've looked at the record and considered\nthose. It was a generic assumption. The assumption is,\nwell, if she can't do this assembly line work, that must\naffect other areas, recreation and household chores.\nA generic assumption like that is wrong, first,\nbecause the ADA specifies you have to look at the\nindividual impacts; second, because the impairments we're\ntalking about, myotendinitis and that sort of thing,\naffect different people in widely different ways. You\ncan't assume, just because someone cannot do the\nrepetitive work for an extended period of time, that\nthat's going to have an effect. Of course --\nQUESTION: You can assume that, though, in some\ncases, couldn't you? I mean, you're not -- if -- suppose\na person says I cannot be a watchmaker and the reason he\ncan't is he's blind. That would be the end of the case,\nwouldn't it? I mean, it would be clear he's disabled.\nMR. ROBERTS: Certainly.\nQUESTION: Even though he only mentioned\nwatchmaking.\nMR. ROBERTS: Certainly.\nQUESTION: All right. So, why can't this woman\nhere say I cannot lift more than 20 pounds ever, I cannot\nlift more than 10 pounds frequently? I cannot perform\nrepetitive motions with both hands over an extended period\nof time, and I cannot work with my hands above my head.\nNow, that's the problem. Now, in addition, that -- I'll\ntell you that makes me too -- it makes it hard for me to\nfind a job.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well --\nQUESTION: But it's -- it's really the\ndisability that we're focusing on, and in the\ncircumstances someone like that would be able not only not\nto perform the job but also not to do the things that the\njudge said below, a reasonable inference from the nature\nof the disability.\nMR. ROBERTS: First, because that type of an\ninference is contradicted by the record. She says I can\ndo other assembly line work, including work that involves\nmanual tasks. The record shows she can take care of\npersonal hygiene. She can do chores around the house.\nThe inference would be -- it's contradicted by the record.\nSecond, the type of manual task that you're\nlooking at -- the problem is no one suggests that she\ncan't use a sponge and wipe down the side of a car. The\nproblem is with the repetitive aspect of it, doing it for\nan extended period of time. The only setting in which\nsomeone would have to do that is in an assembly line job,\nand therefore, if anything, the -- the disability should\nbe analyzed under the major life activity of working, if\nthat is a major life activity.\nQUESTION: Why -- that's what I -- my -- until\nyou said the last part, my thought was, well, we need a\ntrial on this.\nMR. ROBERTS: Oh, no.\nQUESTION: How serious is this disability? What\ndoes it disqualify her from doing? But do we have to go\non to categorize between whether it's working, gardening,\nwhat is a major life activity? I mean, isn't it just is\nthis person hurt badly enough that there are an awful lot\nof things that she can't do?\nMR. ROBERTS: No, no. The statute sets forth a\nstandard, substantial limitation on a major life activity.\nTherefore, the way the cases have been tried, you identify\na major life activity.\nQUESTION: That's the part that's bothering me.\nYou're absolutely right. And what I wonder is whether\nthis statute intends the courts to be so rigid as to say,\nwell, you've got to get into an argument about whether\nit's working, gardening, this or that or the other thing,\nor to use a more broad, general judgment, is this person\nincapable of doing a lot of things that people do in life.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, first of all, with respect\nto working, it is important I think to identify what major\nlife activity you're talking about because as the EEOC has\nrecognized in its regulations, as this Court has\nindicated, there are all sorts of problems when you say\nworking is a major life activity. The problems are,\nfirst, that it's completely circular. The -- the need for\nan accommodation establishes the entitlement to it if your\nlife activity is working. That's not how the statute\nshould work. It should work by identifying a disability\nand then seeing if it can be accommodated.\nWorking is also unusual in the sense that it is\nnot the individual's physical characteristics or condition\nthat are primarily significant in deciding whether there's\na disability, but the demands of the job. That's unlike\nthe other major life activities that Congress was talking\nabout, seeing, hearing, breathing, walking. Working -- it\nsuddenly becomes not only circular, but it looks like\nyou're talking more about the job than the individual.\nThat's why I do think it is important to -- to\ndraw a distinction, and what the court of appeals did, of\ncourse, was look at manual tasks but then say only the\nmanual tasks associated with work.\nAnd with respect again to the record, the record\nshows that Ms. Williams can do a broad range of manual\ntasks. When you compare the approach here to the approach\nof the other courts of appeals, the Eleventh Circuit in\ncases that we've discussed in our brief, Chanda and\nHillburn, or the Fifth Circuit in Dutcher. This doesn't\ncome close. She can do a broad range of manual\nactivities. Yes --\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Roberts, can I just\ninterrupt again? I -- you've explained by the 50 percent\nfigure is -- is wrong. But assume for the moment that\nthere were -- she was disabled from performing 50 percent\nof the job opportunities available in the State, and in\naddition, there were a random number of additional things\nlike playing tennis and playing the piano and so forth\nthat she could not do. Would it still not be -- would it\nbe impermissible to analyze this as the disability being\ninability to use the hands like most people can and the\nmajor part of the evidence relates to work, but then there\nare these other things she also cannot do? Does she have\nto have the other things -- you have to separate them.\nCan't you look at the two together?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, you can, and -- and certainly\nin a manual tasks case, you can submit evidence and say,\nhere's an example of manual tasks that I can't perform,\nthe ones that are required at work. There's nothing wrong\nwith that.\nThe problem is in artificially limiting it to it\nand looking only at the manual tasks associated with work.\nThat's not enough. But yes, it certainly could be part of\nher case that I can't do this job at work. But there has\nto be more because otherwise she hasn't shown a\nsubstantial limitation on the major life activity of\nperforming manual tasks.\nQUESTION: Is it -- is it your view that by\nincluding the non-work impairment that she has, you sort\nof increase the universe of things she has to -- you\ncompare it to, and therefore, there's a smaller percentage\nof an impairment, and therefore, it's not substantial?\nMR. ROBERTS: If the claim is I'm limited in\nmanual tasks, you do have to look, and this is what all\nthe other courts of appeals have done, the broad range of\nmanual tasks. It's not enough, obviously, at one extreme\nif there's a peculiar task that you can't do, but you can\ndo everything else.\nQUESTION: What you're objecting to particularly\nI suppose is the sentence of the court's opinion which\nsays the fact that Williams can perform a range of\nisolated, non-repetitive manual tasks performed over a\nshort period of time, such as tending to her personal\nhygiene or carrying out personal or household chores, does\nnot affect a determination that her impairment\nsubstantially limits her ability to perform the range of\nmanual tasks associated with an assembly line job.\nMR. ROBERTS: That's right.\nQUESTION: In other words, it made that\ncriterion of whether she's -- she's substantially limited.\nMR. ROBERTS: That's wrong. In that sentence,\nthe court of appeals said, okay, you can do a lot of\nthings, but you can't do the assembly line job, and not\nbeing able to do the assembly line job is enough for us.\nAnd that was what was wrong with the court of appeals --\nQUESTION: So, the nub of it is the -- the\nlimitation to considering one job; i.e., an assembly line\njob.\nMR. ROBERTS: With respect to working --\nQUESTION: That if -- if there was one\noverriding sin, that was it, wasn't it? Instead of\nconsidering a range of jobs -- I'm sorry -- a class of\njobs --\nMR. ROBERTS: If -- if they're going to look at\nit under manual tasks, you've got to look at all manual\ntasks.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ROBERTS: If you're going to look at it\nunder working, you've got to look at either a class or a\nbroad range of jobs.\nQUESTION: I was going to say if you're doing it\nunder -- under the major life activity of manual tasks,\nyou wouldn't just look at jobs.\nMR. ROBERTS: Not just jobs. It has to be the\nbroad range. And typically what the courts have done --\nQUESTION: Yes, but it -- I didn't mean to\ninterrupt you. I was going to say, but if -- assume they\nstart out, our category is going to be manual tasks, and\nthey had come up with 100 jobs in which she could not\nperform manual tasks, would that not have satisfied the --\nthe required inquiry under -- under manual tasks?\nMR. ROBERTS: I would still need to know what\nabout everyday activities. Maybe the jobs involved\nspecialized, idiosyncratic manual tasks. Can she --\nQUESTION: Yes, but at this point, aren't we\ngetting sort of academic about it? If somebody -- let's\nassume the category is manual tasks, but they identify 100\njobs which she -- I mean, a great range of things that she\ncan't do. Isn't it a little unrealistic to say, well, she\nmight be able to vacuum the floor at home? I mean, at\nthat point, you've made a pretty good prima facie case,\nhaven't you?\nMR. ROBERTS: The -- the evidence then would\nprobably not be that she can take care of herself\ngenerally. She can cook. She can do laundry. She can --\nas the evidence is in this case.\nQUESTION: No. But the question that he's --\nwhat if the evidence did show she could do all these\nthings?\nMR. ROBERTS: Then it would seem to me to be\nproperly analyzed as a working case. That's where her\nproblem is, according to the -- this unusual record we've\nhypothesized, only a problem at work. Then look at it as\na working case. If it's a manual task case, you have to\nlook at the broad range of manual tasks.\nI'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Roberts.\nMs. McDowell, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nMS. McDOWELL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nWe agree that the Sixth Circuit applied an\nincorrect test in determining whether a person is\nsubstantially limited in the major life activity of\nperforming manual tasks.\nThe correct test asks whether a person is\nsignificantly restricted relative to the average person in\nperforming those basic manual tasks that are central to\neveryday life, tasks such as grasping objects,\nmanipulating objects, holding objects. That inquiry is\nindicated by the statutory focus on substantial limits and\nmajor life activities.\nThe Sixth Circuit's approach, which focuses only\non a plaintiff's ability to perform particular manual\ntasks required by a specific job, seems to us both over-\ninclusive and under-inclusive.\nFirst, the Sixth Circuit's approach would extend\nthe protections of the act to persons who are\nsubstantially limited only in performing a particular job,\nnot in everyday life and not in performing a range of jobs\nor a class of jobs. That approach would undermine the\nestablished test for establishing a substantial limitation\nbased on the major life activity of working. That test,\nas the Court recognized in Sutton, requires the plaintiff\nto show that she's substantially limited in a class or a\nrange of jobs.\nQUESTION: Ms. McDowell, I didn't think that the\nSixth Circuit had said we're looking only at one job. I\nthought they were looking at assembly line work as a broad\ncategory of jobs.\nMS. McDOWELL: No, we don't think so, Your\nHonor. And I would refer you to page 4a of the petition\nappendix where the court is engaging its analysis. It\nrefers to certain types of manual assembly line jobs that\nrequire the gripping of tools and repetitive work with\nhands and arms extended out or above shoulder level for\nextended periods of time. So, it appears that the Sixth\nCircuit was focusing on a particular category of assembly\nline jobs and not assembly line jobs generally.\nQUESTION: Types. It uses the plural. So, it\nwasn't just talking about a particular job, which is what\nI thought you reduced this to, and I think that is not\nquite a fair characterization of what the court said.\nMS. McDOWELL: That may be correct, Justice\nGinsburg. It may be that the Sixth Circuit was thinking\nabout categories of jobs that would require these\nparticular limits. There is no indication in the record,\nthough, of how many other assembly line jobs there are\nthat would -- the plaintiff would be disqualified from\nperforming.\nQUESTION: It refers to painting, plumbing, and\nroofing, et cetera.\nMS. McDOWELL: That's correct. And that appears\nto be an assumption by the court of appeals. There does\nnot appear, at least from our examination of what record\nhas been presented to this Court, any specific discussion\nof building trades, plumbing, roofing, et cetera in the\nrecord.\nQUESTION: I suppose it's perfectly obvious a\nperson who can't raise their hands above heart level\ncouldn't paint the ceiling at least.\nMS. McDOWELL: That may well be correct, Your\nHonor. The analysis, if one --\nQUESTION: She'd have to paint floors\npresumably. Right?\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: And most painters are not limited to\njust painting floors, I don't think.\nMS. McDOWELL: That's correct.\nAnd if one is focusing on limitations in work,\nthe correct analysis is whether a plaintiff is\ndisqualified from a class of jobs, jobs that require\nsimilar training, abilities, skills, et cetera, or a range\nof jobs, jobs that do not necessarily require the same\nskills and training, but jobs that the plaintiff could\nperform.\nWe have no position at this point whether the\nplaintiff in this case could or couldn't demonstrate that\nshe is substantially disabled under the working test the\ncourt --\nQUESTION: Under the working test, do you just\nlook at the whole scope of jobs, or isn't it just limited\nto jobs that this person is -- has some demonstrated\ncapacity for or interest in? I mean, you know, what if I\ncan't be a -- you know, a jet pilot? You know, I'm\ndisabled from being a jet pilot. I have no interest in\nbeing a jet pilot. My other abilities would not -- would\nnot enable me to be a jet pilot anyway. Is -- is that\nirrelevant to the -- to working inquiry?\nMS. McDOWELL: No, it's not irrelevant, Justice\nScalia. The analysis focuses on those jobs that the\nplaintiff, without her impairment, would have the skills\nand ability to perform.\nQUESTION: Right. And had she been a roofer\nbefore?\nMS. McDOWELL: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I didn't think so.\nQUESTION: Under the Longshore Harbor Workers\nand Compensation Act, the courts routinely look at what\njobs are in the community that this person is eligible for\nafter they've suffered an injury. Is that about the same\napproach that we should use in this case -- in these kinds\nof cases --\nMS. McDOWELL: I'm not entirely familiar with\nthe statutory --\nQUESTION: -- when we're looking at the -- when\nwe're looking at the employment aspect?\nMS. McDOWELL: Yes. I'm not entirely familiar\nwith the specific statutory scheme you're referring to,\nbut it may be similar to that under the Social Security\nAct which looks at whether somebody can perform any\ngainful activity in the national economy, and the\nDisabilities Act doesn't require that broad a standard.\nIt looks at -- in a more limited way at whether a\nplaintiff is substantially limited in performing jobs.\nThere still may be jobs that she can perform. The\nquestion is whether there is a substantial limitation that\nwould disqualify her from a --\nQUESTION: Ms. McDowell, in looking at the\nmanual task approach, how -- how is the fact finder\nsupposed to decide which manual tasks are sufficiently\nimportant to constitute a substantial limitation? How do\nyou weigh that? How do we decide it? Is there any\nguidance on that?\nMS. McDOWELL: The courts of appeals thus far\nhave looked at -- aside from the Sixth Circuit, of course,\nhave looked to those manual tasks that are basic to\neveryday life. We would say, perhaps in some disagreement\nwith Toyota, that it's not necessary to be substantially\nimpaired in a broad range of manual tasks. There may be\ncertain manual tasks that are particularly important to\neveryday life, such as the ability to grasp a pen or\npencil and write, that in themselves may be sufficient to\nconstitute a -- a substantial limitation on the major life\nactivity.\nQUESTION: On -- on a question like substantial,\ncertainly you would get to a jury question at some point,\nwouldn't you?\nMS. McDOWELL: Oh, certainly it would become a\njury question in many cases.\nQUESTION: Conceptually it seems to work better\nyour -- your way. You say life activity is just like\nlifting or breathing, and the issue turns on what's\nsubstantial. What do we do about the EEOC regs that seem\nto embody what you would call a conceptual confusion?\nThey talk about working being a substantial life activity,\nthat working shouldn't be there. It should be evidentiary\nof whether the -- of whether the impairment of being able\nto lift your hands is substantial, and if you can't hold\nhalf the jobs, that's fairly good evidence. And if you --\nyou know, whether it's enough or not, I don't know.\nBut what do we do about the EEOC regs that don't\nseem to take the simple conceptual way you're advocating?\nMS. McDOWELL: The EEOC regs that you're\nreferring to discuss the major life activity of working.\nQUESTION: Yes, that wrecks it.\nMS. McDOWELL: The regs also recognize that\nperforming manual tasks is a separate major life activity.\nQUESTION: I know. I know, but they're taking\nthe wrong -- they're taking the wrong approach in your\nview. So, whereas I find your view much simpler -- and I\nagree with you, it isn't any harsher or more lenient, just\nsimpler. What do we do about the fact that the agency in\ncharge seems not to have taken that route?\nMS. McDOWELL: I believe this route is\nconsistent with what the agency has said, specifically\nthat one should consider working as a major life activity\nonly if a plaintiff cannot satisfy any of the other major\nlife activities, including performing manual tasks.\nQUESTION: May I ask you one question? Is it\nrelevant that she may not be able to perform a lot of jobs\nshe never performed? For example, is it relevant that she\ncouldn't be a roofer, for example?\nMS. McDOWELL: It may or may not, and I'm not\nsure that we have a position on that at this point,\nJustice Stevens. It may, in fact, be the defendant's\nburden to come forward with evidence that a plaintiff\ncouldn't perform, for example, in this case medium duty\nwork. The mere fact that she hadn't done it --\nQUESTION: But you don't -- you don't suggest we\njust look at her employment history and that's the only\npossible thing we look at in determining whether her\nworking ability has been impaired.\nMS. McDOWELL: No, I don't think you look only\nat the plaintiff's working history.\nQUESTION: It would be relevant then that she\ncouldn't be a roofer, electrician, or a painter or a lot\nof other things.\nMS. McDOWELL: It may well be relevant. There\nmay also be countervailing evidence that she had other\nlack of skills and so on that would prevent her from\nperforming those particular jobs.\nI'd also like to note that the Sixth Circuit's\napproach not only is over-inclusive in some respects, but\nit's also under-inclusive in some respects. It would seem\nto preclude a plaintiff from establishing a disability in\nthe performance of manual tasks based on manual tasks\nperformed outside the work place. In many cases, a\nplaintiff may be capable of performing manual tasks in the\nwork place, when the work place does not impose\nparticularly demanding obligations in that regard, but\nstill may be limited outside the work place.\nQUESTION: To what extent do we take account of\nthe particular individual? For example, for someone who\nis making a high income as a corporate executive, it\nwouldn't matter that she couldn't vacuum the rug because\nshe has paid someone else to do that for many years. So,\nto what extent do we -- are we thinking of a generalized\nperson to what extent the particular individual who is\nclaiming to be disabled?\nMS. McDOWELL: May I answer, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. McDOWELL: In focusing on a major life\nactivity of manual tasks, we would suggest looking at the\ngeneralized person. With respect to working, it's a\nsomewhat more tailored analysis.\nQUESTION: Thank you. Thank you, Ms. McDowell.\nMr. Rosenbaum, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. ROSENBAUM\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ROSENBAUM: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case is not about the inability to perform\na single job. The Sixth Circuit did not rest its opinion\nupon a finding that Ms. Williams was only unable to\nperform one solitary job. While I believe that there are\ninconsistencies in the Sixth Circuit opinion which cannot\nbe reconciled and while I disagree with part of the legal\nanalysis for reasons other than the reasons advanced by\npetitioner, it's not a single job case.\nThe Sixth Circuit stated at 6a of the opinion of\nthe appendix to the petition, here the impairments of\nlimbs are sufficiently severe to be like deformed limbs,\nand such activities affect manual tasks associated with\nworking, as well as manual tasks associated with\nrecreation, household chores, and living generally.\nQUESTION: Mr. Rosenbaum, so far as the question\npresented here is, you would defend the Sixth Circuit's\nopinion?\nMR. ROSENBAUM: I defend the result, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nQUESTION: But not the reasoning?\nMR. ROSENBAUM: Not in its entirety, but part of\nit I do.\nQUESTION: Well, where do you disagree?\nMR. ROSENBAUM: I disagree when the Sixth\nCircuit says that after you determine an individual is\nsubstantially limited, you must go farther and that\nindividual must show that their limitation affects their\nwork. And I think that that is the additional requirement\nthat the Sixth Circuit would place on defining substantial\nlimitation. I think it's, at best, superfluous and, at\nworst, makes every disability a working disability.\nBut the Sixth Circuit -- I must defend them to\nsome extent. They quoted the correct statute.\nQUESTION: Well, they ruled for your client.\nYes.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROSENBAUM: Well, then I -- yes, sir, and I\nappreciated that.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROSENBAUM: At -- at 3a of the appendix,\nthey cite the correct statutory language. They emphasize\nthat the impairment must substantially limit. They know\nwhat the law is. They specifically refer to this Court's\nopinion in Sutton and says you can't prove a disability\nbased upon a failure to do one particular job.\nQUESTION: Well, do you think a -- a fair\nreading of the opinion in the -- at the end of the\ncarryover paragraph at 4a, it says, it would appear,\nnevertheless, from the language of the act, the EEOC's\ninterpretation of the Supreme Court analysis in Sutton,\nthat in order to be disabled, the plaintiff must show that\nher manual disability involves a class of manual\nactivities affecting the ability to perform tasks at work.\nYou want us to read that as saying to perform tasks at a\nclass of work activities, at a broad range of work\nactivities.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: I -- I think --\nMR. ROSENBAUM: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: -- you want us to interpret it that\nway and that we have to interpret it that way in order to\nsave it, don't we?\nMR. ROSENBAUM: Your Honor, I would say that\nthat sentence --\nQUESTION: -- come close to saving it.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: -- that sentence has no place in\nthe analysis at all. That's what's superfluous about the\nSixth Circuit analysis.\nQUESTION: Okay. So, I'll x that out of the\nopinion then.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: That's correct.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I though that was the heart of the\nopinion.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: Well, it is not, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: It's x'ed out now.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROSENBAUM: The -- the Sixth Circuit found\nthat she has the impairment, myotendinitis, myofacial\npain, carpal tunnel syndrome. They found that she\nidentified the major life activity of working -- excuse me\n-- of manual tasks. And then they found that she was\nsubstantially limited in performing the major life\nactivity of manual tasks because of the uncontroverted,\nuncontradicted evidence as to how this affected her life.\nAnd they should have stopped there. It was when\nthey went on, apparently out of some kind of concern about\nSutton, that I think they lost their way, and I think that\nthis concept of class probably only fits into an analysis\nof the major life activity of working.\nIf you look at the regulations involving this,\nwhich are in the petitioner's brief on the merits at 19a,\nsubparagraph number 2, it says with respect to the major\nlife activity of working, substantially limits means\nsignificantly restricted in the ability to perform either\na class of jobs or a broad range of jobs. I would suggest\nto you this only has to do with working. It doesn't have\nto do with manual tasks. Manual tasks is at the top of\npage 19a.\nAnd really, in formulating what the correct\nanalysis of substantial limitation under the ADA is, I\nthink the question is obvious. It is spelled out in the\nregulation. No party to this proceeding challenges the\nregulations, says that the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission didn't have authority to promulgate the\nregulations. Everyone agrees that the regulations are\nvalid, and in past cases in -- in that circumstance, this\nCourt has been willing to accept those regulations as\nvalid.\nAnd the regulations say what substantially\nlimited means. It means that they are significantly\nrestricted as to the condition, manner, or duration -- or\n-- that is disjunctive, not conjunctive -- under which an\nindividual can perform a particular major life activity as\ncompared to the condition, manner, or duration under which\nthe average person in the general population can\nperform --\nQUESTION: Yes, a particular major life\nactivity, not a single major -- not a single manual task\nand not a limited number of manual tasks. But it is\ndisjunctive, either the duration or the -- the severity,\nwhatever. But of the major life activity. So, you're\ntalking about a person who cannot perform for a long\nduration substantial -- substantially can't perform manual\ntasks. And -- and the evidence here didn't support that\nexcept for -- except for certain manual tasks done for a\nlong period above shoulder level.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: Your Honor, I would respectfully\ndiffer with you. I think the record is to the contrary.\nI would point out to you the restrictions found in the\njoint appendix at, I think, page 45. These restrictions\nwere permanent in nature. They existed since May of 1992.\nJustice Breyer referred to them a moment ago. I don't\nwant to be unduly repetitive about this, but it said that\nshe cannot repetitively flex or extend her wrists, flex or\nextend her elbows. She can't use her arms. She can't use\nher shoulders repetitively. She can't pick up more than\n20 pounds ever. She can only regularly pick up 10 pounds,\nand she can't use vibratory or pneumatic type tools. And\na vibratory -- or appliance, I presume -- a vibratory\nappliance would be a vacuum cleaner, a hair drier, a hand\nmixer.\nIt's not that she wants to maintain that on each\nindividual thing such as gardening, getting dressed,\nplaying with her children, picking up a grandchild who\nweighs -- weighs more than 20 -- 20 pounds, that she has\ngot to prove she's substantially limited as to all of\nthat, it's that she has the generic overall limitation\nwhich manifests itself in these specific examples. And\nwhen --\nQUESTION: So, that's -- that's what I'd like to\nknow how to deal with exactly. My impression, which may\nbe yours, is that the simplest thing to say is the words,\nmajor life activity, refer really to the nature of the\ndisability. For example, use of hands. A person who has\ntorticollis, for example, would be restricted in moving\nhis neck, and that interferes with lots of things. But\nyou don't necessarily have to pin down one. You say it\ninterferes with dealing with other people. It interferes\nwith working around the house. It interferes with holding\na job. It interferes with all of them.\nThen the issue becomes whether it's substantial.\nAnd all of these work-related things that you're talking\nto are evidentiary in respect to the question of\nsubstantiality. Is that the right framework? And if so,\nhow do we get there?\nMR. ROSENBAUM: I think we are there.\nQUESTION: We are there. Good.\nWell, what about -- so, then I saw the EEOC reg,\nwhich talks about the major -- the major life activity of\nworking, and that would be a category mistake because it\nisn't -- there isn't a major life activity of working.\nWhat happens at work is evidentiary of whether the\nrestriction on moving your hands is a substantial\nrestriction.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: I would submit it's a question\nof substantiality always, that you're correct in stating\nthat the degree of impairment and the definition of the\nmajor life activity are inevitably linked together in the\nanalysis. But what this Court I hope will do is to give\nguidance and clarification as to how substantial the\nlimitation has to be before it is a substantial limitation\nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act, that this Court\nwill view the regulations, which are uncontroverted,\nuncontradicted, not questioned, and will say that this, at\nleast in this case certainly, is the standard of how\nsubstantial it is.\nQUESTION: Do you think we should say that\nworking is a major life activity?\nMR. ROSENBAUM: It is my opinion that working is\na major life activity. It is a major life activity which\nis separate from performing manual tasks, and we are in\nagreement in this case that, as regards the separate life\nactivity -- major life activity of performing manual\ntasks, we can consider how that affects work.\nQUESTION: It's a little hard to think of a\ndisability that affects a broad range of employment tasks\nthat doesn't affect other areas of life.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: Well, of course.\nQUESTION: I -- I can't -- and as Justice Breyer\nsaid, these are evidentiary matters that go to a larger\npoint.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: Well, that's why Ms. Williams --\nQUESTION: But the statute does talk about major\nlife activity.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: That's why this -- Ms. Williams'\ncase is a strong case.\nQUESTION: But the Sixth Circuit did not rely on\nworking being a major life activity.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: They never got there because\nthey had already found Ms. Williams to be disabled as a\nmatter of law and hence it was unnecessary to find her\ndisabled.\nQUESTION: As a -- as a matter of law, Mr.\nRosenbaum, no, they did not say simply that summary\njudgment should not have been granted for Toyota, but that\nsummary judgment should be granted for Ms. Williams?\nMR. ROSENBAUM: It is my belief that that's what\nthe opinion says, and I --\nQUESTION: Well, but -- but now surely we\nshouldn't have to talk about beliefs as to what an opinion\nsaid.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: I -- I have to give a caveat\nabout my remarks, which is that there are inconsistencies\nin this opinion. I know that on the first page of the\nopinion the court enunciates the summary judgment standard\nand says, we're here to determine whether or not the\nsummary judgment against Ms. Williams was appropriate,\ngiving Ms. Williams the benefit of the inferences. But at\nthe end of the opinion, they say, because we have found\nher ADA disabled as a matter of law, we remand solely to\ndetermine whether the requested accommodation was\nreasonable or whether the employer had some other defense.\nI can't reconcile it.\nQUESTION: That's one -- that's one of the\ninconsistencies.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: Yes, Your Honor, that is one of\nthe inconsistencies.\nAnd there's -- and I also disagree with the\nlegal analysis. They didn't make the mistake that the\npetitioner says they made. The mistake they met -- they\nmade was by going that extra step, after finding her\nsubstantially disabled, and said you've got to relate that\nparticularly to her work, and I don't think that that's\nthe law, nor do I think it should be the law.\nQUESTION: The trouble, of course, is -- is\ndefining what substantially disabled means. Unlike\nemployment compensation laws, this statute was not\nintended to require accommodation for everybody who is in\nfact disabled in -- in one way or another. I mean, lost a\nthumb, you know, lost -- lost an arm, whatever.\nYou know, in our earlier opinions in this area,\nwe have -- we have referred to the fact that -- that\nCongress clearly did not think that half of the population\nwould be covered by -- by this. It was addressing what it\nthought was a limited class of people, the handicapped, a\nlimited class of people against whom there had been\ntraditional -- what should I say -- feelings of -- of\ndisfavor.\nAnd now, do you think that -- that given that\nlimited notion of the handicapped and what it meant by\nsubstantial limitation of a major life activity, it's\nsufficient to -- to refer to simply what you referred to\nin the appendix, the statement of Dr. Kleinert, which says\nshe cannot lift 20 pounds -- she can only lift 20 pounds\nmaximum and no frequent lifting or carrying of objects\nweighing up to 10 pounds? She cannot make constant,\nrepetitive use of flexion/extension of wrist/elbow.\nConstant. She can do it, but not constantly. No overhead\nwork and no use of vibratory or pneumatic tools. Those\nare the only things that he -- now, do you think that's\nenough to bring her within the -- the category of the\nhandicapped that this piece of legislation was addressing?\nAnd that's really the question here.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: It was several questions, Your\nHonor.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROSENBAUM: The -- first of all, the\nevidence in this case that you recited I think is\nsufficient to bring her within the coverage of the act.\nSecondly, there is more evidence in the record\nthat supports Ms. Williams' position than what you\nreferred to, and I can go into it in detail if you would\ncare for me to.\nQUESTION: I only used that because that's what\nyou referred to.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: I can't -- I have limited time,\nand -- and I can tell you that this is not simply a sore\nwrist case. Ms. Williams was diagnosed by a board\ncertified orthopedic surgeon. She had muscular spasms and\nknotting which were palpable. Those were injected with\nmedications, with trigger point injections. There was an\nMRI of her shoulder showing inflammation and\nperitendinitis. There is uncontradicted testimony that\nshe has trouble dressing. She has -- does do housework.\nShe has pain when she vacuums. Gardening has been pretty\nmuch abandoned.\nQUESTION: Well, now she did get workman's\ncompensation benefits presumably.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: As a result of the initial event\nwhere she initially --\nQUESTION: Does -- does the existence of\nworkman's compensation schemes help us in giving meaning\nto substantial limitation language under the Disabilities\nAct? I mean, it wasn't intended to replace workman's comp\nschemes, and somebody who gets a bad back or a tendinitis\nor a carpal tunnel syndrome presumably can resort to\nworkman's comp to get some compensation and some relief.\nBut do you think that the Disabilities Act had a broader\nscope and maybe was focused more on discrimination against\npeople who are wheelchair-bound or something like that\nwhere employers tended to say, gosh, I'm not going to\nconsider hiring anybody like that?\nMR. ROSENBAUM: The worker's compensation award\nis probative as to the issue of whether or not she is ADA\ndisabled. It is not preclusive one way or the other, but\nit -- but it's a good piece of evidence because the\nworker's compensation award says that this is a lady who,\nbecause of her injuries, has suffered a decrease in the\nearning capacity in the area of where she lives of 20\npercent of what was available to her, and that's\nsubstantial.\nI also want to go back, if I might, to Justice\nScalia's comment on the limited number. When the ADA was\npassed in 1990, Congress specifically noted there were 43\nmillion Americans who would come within the protection of\nthe act. The National Employment Lawyers amicus brief\nrefers to census data of 1989, the year before, which\nindicates that at the time Congress passed this\nlegislation, 17.3 percent of the population were going to\nbe considered ADA disabled, and it was anticipated that\nthe number of individuals meeting that disability would\nincrease as time went by. And so, I think it's fair to\nsay that, yes, it's a limited and discrete group of\npeople, but it's close to 20 percent of the American\npopulation. One out of five Americans is going to\nqualify.\nQUESTION: Well, you're exaggerating it now.\nIt's -- it's under 20 percent, and -- and I wonder whether\n-- you know, when you count just -- just the wheelchair-\nbound or, you know, the homebound, those who really cannot\n-- cannot walk, cannot walk outside the house, it brings\nyou -- it brings you pretty high up towards that figure.\nAnd -- and when you start adding people who have, you\nknow, relatively minor manual disabilities -- let's take\ncarpal tunnel syndrome, for example. Is that a\ndisability? Does it disable you from certain manual\nthings? Certainly it does. Would you consider that a --\na disability that qualifies as a -- an impairment of a\nmajor life activity?\nMR. ROSENBAUM: We know that the inquiry as to\nwhether or not an individual is disabled is an\nindividualized inquiry. That's per Sutton. You can't\nhave a per se finding of disability based upon the\nnomenclature of a medical diagnosis. I understand and I\nthink the AFL-CIO brief talks about what carpal tunnel and\ntendinitis and all of this in a medical sense. But there\nare varying degrees of severity, and so to tell me that an\nindividual has carpal tunnel syndrome doesn't answer the\nquestion of whether that individual is ADA disabled.\nWe've got to go on and look.\nQUESTION: So -- so, you think that the most\nsevere case of carpal tunnel syndrome would qualify.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: If it --\nQUESTION: Otherwise you could have answered my\nquestion no. You -- you think --\nMR. ROSENBAUM: I -- I certainly --\nQUESTION: -- there has to be an individualized\ndetermination because the most severe case of carpal\ntunnel syndrome could qualify as rendering that person a\ndisabled person within the meaning of this -- this\nspecialized legislation.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: That's right because the\nregulations say is that if they're significantly\nrestricted concerning the condition, the manner, or the\nduration of the activity, then they are substantially\ndisabled. And in this situation, no one would say that\nthe average person in the American society can't flex and\nextend repetitively, can't do repetitive motion, is\nlimited in lifting, has trouble --\nQUESTION: Mr. Rosenbaum, do you have any notion\nof what percentage of the population would be taken in if\nwe use the standard -- the class that she was put in for\nworker's compensation purposes, a 20 percent occupational\nimpairment -- how many people?\nMR. ROSENBAUM: I have no figures that would\nrelate that to the population as a whole.\nQUESTION: Is there anything that suggests that\nthose people, the people who are in a sense not the most\ndisabled, but the people who are not quite in that\ncategory are the ones who are really discriminated\nagainst? Because the ones who can't work at all,\nobviously, are not discriminated against. The ones who\nwould be discriminated against would be the ones who --\nwho might work, but -- which is something bothering me\nabout using the major life activity of working. How is\nthat -- how does that play out?\nMR. ROSENBAUM: Well, I'm not sure that I can\nexplain all of its ramifications, but I can say that there\nwas certainly a concern that people who were labeled\ndisabled would be stereotyped and that employers would be\nhesitant to give them the same vocational opportunities as\nnon-disabled people would be, even though the disability\nhad no effect on the job. They would perhaps be afraid of\nhaving more worker's compensation claims. They would\nperhaps be afraid of excess absenteeism, all of this type\nof thing. But --\nQUESTION: One -- one of the problems with this\nis we're looking at the entry classification, disability,\nbut on the facts of this case, she was able to do a job if\nthe employer sliced it a certain way. And then the\nemployer says, well, for the good of my work force and\ncompany, I don't want people to do just that narrow thing.\nI want them to be able to do four different jobs and\nrotate. That's a common business practice. And the --\nthe concern is does it mean if she is able to do, as she\nwas able to do for 3 years, a simple job, she uniquely and\nall the people who work there has to be able to have this\nspecial job when the others all have to rotate into four\ndifferent positions.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: That issue is not reached in\nthis case. That is an issue of whether or not, with or\nwithout accommodation, Ms. Williams can perform all of the\nessential tasks of the employment. And --\nQUESTION: I -- I know that we -- we don't get\nto what is the -- how much accommodation would be\nrequired, but it's a little hard to keep that from view\nbecause if the employer doesn't have -- would not have to\nmake the accommodation that she's seeking, then this case\nis not very significant. It's just a question at what\nstage she loses.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: Well, let me -- let me say a\ncouple of things. It wasn't an essential task of Ms.\nWilliams' job that she performed the wiping in the shell\nbody for 3 years. She could perform a full job for 3\nyears without having to do that, and so, we would say\nthat --\nQUESTION: But the employer decided to change\nwhat the workers do, and as I understand assembly lines,\nthat's not uncommon to take people from doing the same\nthing every day, day in and day out, train them for\nseveral jobs, and then they rotate.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: In the Sixth Circuit, there's\nthe case of Kiphart v. Saturn where that issue was put to\nthe jury where the employer said, you've got to be able to\nrotate through all of the tasks in your group, and since\nyou, the allegedly disabled person, were not able to,\nwe're entitled to fire you. The jury did not accept the\nemployer's statement because the jury determined that the\nemployer did not, in fact, require all employees to do\nevery job.\nAnd in this particular case, the evidence is\nthat the area that Ms. Williams went back into, the\ninspection job, was a job where medically placed people\nwould be put, people who were known to have problems with\ntheir hands and arms and shoulders. That's the quote from\nKendall Hall. And so, this entire group was made up of\nphysically limited people and were put there as a matter\nof accommodation by Toyota. And in those circumstances,\nif Toyota on remand, if -- if we go there, wants to argue\nto the jury that it was essential, then this is a -- a\nmatter the jury will have to determine, but we say it\nwasn't.\nQUESTION: Essential is not the standard of\naccommodation, is it?\nMR. ROSENBAUM: Excuse me?\nQUESTION: Isn't -- essential isn't the\nstandard, is it, that the employer has to show that it's\nessential --\nMR. ROSENBAUM: No.\nQUESTION: -- that their work be arranged --\nMR. ROSENBAUM: No, no. There are\nreasonableness considerations to accommodation. It is --\nthe definition of the individual who is eligible to ADA\nprotection is that that individual is a qualified\nindividual with a disability, meaning that although they\nare significantly and substantially limited in a major\nlife activity, they can do all of the essential tasks of\nthe employment either with or without accommodation.\nAnd there was a -- if I might go on, there was a\nrefrain in the -- in the question that you asked about,\nwell, if they can do all of these things, how can they be\ndisabled. The ADA looks at what a person can't do. It\ndoesn't help or further the inquiry to say what they do,\nif they can do all these things.\nQUESTION: Well, doesn't -- don't you have to\nlook at both in -- in trying to assess the extent of\nsomebody's incapacity to do a major life activity?\nMR. ROSENBAUM: You -- you inevitably --\nQUESTION: What they can do and what they can't?\nMR. ROSENBAUM: In fact, inevitably by\nconsidering one, you consider the other, obviously. But\nit's not a defense to the ADA claim to say, look, they can\ndo a lot of stuff. You've got to look at what they can't\ndo.\nThat's what the Southeastern Community College\ncase is about. That's what Bragdon means when it says,\nyou don't have to be utterly unable. You have to have a\nlot of capacity to do ADA -- to be an ADA disabled person.\nThe ADA is about working. It's about a lawsuit\nto try to keep a job. This is a basic, fundamental\nAmerican value. Why shouldn't it be promoted?\nQUESTION: Mr. Rosenbaum, could -- could you\ntell us what you want us to do? Assuming we agree with\nyou, you want us to take the Sixth Circuit opinion as --\nas affirming a summary judgment for you on the disability\nportion. Correct?\nMR. ROSENBAUM: Correct.\nQUESTION: Now, let's assume we don't agree with\nyou on -- on the point. As I understand it, the\npetitioner wants us to reverse the Sixth Circuit and\nreinstate the district court's summary judgment against\nyou. Isn't that correct?\nMR. ROSENBAUM: Not in total. They --\nQUESTION: I thought that's -- that's what they\nsay, and I'm wondering --\nMR. ROSENBAUM: They want --\nQUESTION: -- wondering why we can do that when\nthe Sixth Circuit hasn't addressed the -- you know, the\nother areas of disability.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: The case is before the Court in\nthe procedural posture of proceedings for a summary\njudgment. The outcomes in the case can be, as a matter of\nlaw, she's insubstantially, insignificantly disabled and\nshe loses, or as a matter of law, she is substantially and\nis significantly impaired and she wins, or she's someplace\nin the middle, and there's a --\nQUESTION: It goes to a jury.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: It goes to the jury.\nThis Court, I think, can probably reach that as\nconcerns manual tasks, but certainly this Court can\nclarify, say what the correct standards are, send the case\nback and let the lower courts apply the standard to the\nrecord before it. And -- and so, if -- if we are not\ngoing to prevail on our contention that Ms. Williams is\ndisabled as a matter of law, then we want to go back for\nthe jury trial, is what we want to do.\nAnd I know I'm almost out. I've got to say on\nthe 50 percent, Justice Stevens, the 50 to 55 percent\nvocational testimony, that was related to Ms. Williams'\ngeographical area. It is in the record. It is\nappropriate evidence, and it is not mentioned at all by\npetitioner in any of petitioner's filings. And I think as\nconcerns working, it is extremely strong evidence.\nI also want to say we have never conceded that\nMs. Williams is incapable of prevailing on working.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Rosenbaum.\nMR. ROSENBAUM: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, you have 2 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROBERTS: Thank you, Your Honor.\nJustice Kennedy, it will not be enough to x out\nthat one sentence on page 4a. You would also have to x\nout the sentence on page 5a saying that an individual is\ndisabled if their impairment, quote, seriously reduces her\nability to perform the manual tasks that are job-related.\nYou would also have to x out the other sentence on page 4a\nthat says a plaintiff is disabled if they're limited in\nperforming, quote, manual tasks associated with an\nassembly line job, end quote. And you would have to x out\nthe sentence on page 2a that says the key issue is whether\nthe plaintiff in this case can use her arms, hands, and\nshoulders, quote, as required by her new job, end quote.\nI respectfully submit that by the time you get through\nx-ing out all those sentences, you should go one step\nfurther and x out the opinion as a whole by holding that\nit is reversed.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: What about the other -- the other two\nissues? I mean, the -- the court of appeals did not\npurport to reach the working as a substantial life\nactivity and what else? Lifting as a substantial life\nactivity. How can we reverse it without addressing those\nissues also, which I don't think we have the tools to do\nhere?\nMR. ROBERTS: You can certainly reverse with\nrespect to the summary judgment on performing manual\ntasks. The issues with respect to lifting and working\nwere not addressed by the court of appeals.\nQUESTION: So, you acknowledge we would have to\nremand for -- for its consideration of those.\nMR. ROBERTS: Unless the Court felt, given the\nfact that the issues with respect to working were\ninsinuated into the case by the Sixth Circuit's approach,\nthat it was appropriate to address that major life\nactivity as well.\nQUESTION: Even as to manual tasks, are you\nasking for a ruling in your favor on summary judgment on\nthat, or are you saying it shouldn't have been effectively\nsummary judgment for the plaintiff and then we go to the\nnext stage, that -- that it could be a jury question on\nmanual tasks?\nMR. ROBERTS: No, no. Summary judgment should\nbe granted in favor of Toyota because you have, with\nrespect to manual tasks, an undisputed factual record, and\nthe question is whether that meets the legal standard of\nsubstantially limited with respect to a major life\nactivity. A jury can decide things like whether can she\nlift 20 pounds or not, if there's a dispute, can she do\nthis or that. But those facts are all undisputed with\nrespect to manual tasks. It is a purely legal question\nwhether she meets the statutory standard.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nRoberts.\n"
