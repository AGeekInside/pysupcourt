        "content": "(11:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in 05-1342, Watters v. Wachovia Bank.\nMr. Blanchard.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOHN BLANCHARD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BLANCHARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe dual banking system of State and Federal\nregulation in our nation which we've enjoyed for over\n140 years is one of the finest examples of cooperative\nfederalism in our history. For 35 years, the States,\nnot the OCC, have prudently exercised their authority\nover non-bank State-chartered operating local\nsubsidiaries of national banks. Indeed, respondent\nWachovia Mortgage complied with Michigan law for 6 years\nuntil in 2003 there was a corporate reshuffling and now\nit claims it's exempt from the same Michigan laws it\ncomplied with.\nThe OCC through its Regulation 7.40006 has\ndisrupted the careful balance and seeks to deprive the\nStates of the regulatory authority that they have\nhistorically exercised.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If the national bank set\nup its mortgage operations as a division or as a\ndepartment, then the sole regulator would be OCC, right?\nMR. BLANCHARD: That's correct, Your Honor.\nBut Wachovia Bank and Wachovia Mortgage made a choice.\nThey made a business judgment to create a\nState-chartered operating subsidiary.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did they do\nthat? What's the advantage to them having that\nsubsidiary rather than doing this directly?\nMR. BLANCHARD: Your Honor, the advantage is\nthat Wachovia Bank insulates itself from liability,\nbecause it's a bedrock principle of state corporate law\nthat the parent corporation is not liable for the acts\nof the subsidiary corporation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So mortgage\nsubsidiary could possibly get into some trouble that the\nbank wants to protect itself from and not have -- they\nhave a certain number of assets that are subject to\nliability in the subsidiary, but they would -- otherwise\nthey'd expose the whole bank to those liabilities?\nMR. BLANCHARD: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nFrom -- the conception behind operating subsidiaries was\nto separate a certain part of the business and the\nattendant risks of that business also to separate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume that the\nFederal regulating authorities require a certain ratio\nof loans to real estate value, things of that sort. And\nI assume that the States may have different rules with\nregard to that; right? In other words, the oversight\nmight be different. The States may be more permissive\nas to certain loans or as to, you know, what the balance\nsheet of the bank has to look like than the Federal\nGovernment is. And if you have a State subsidiary that\nis overseen by state authorities, you might have a\ndifferent result.\nMR. BLANCHARD: Possibly, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if not I don't see\nany advantage in this great Federal banking system\nyou're talking about, if it's Tweedledum and Tweedledee.\nMR. BLANCHARD: Well, the States do not --\nexclusive visitorial powers over national banks rest\nwith the OCC. But Wachovia Bank and Wachovia Mortgage\nare separate and distinct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not seeking\nvisit -- \"visitorial,\" is that the word?\nMR. BLANCHARD: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not seeking\nvisitorial rights with respect to the parent bank.\nMR. BLANCHARD: Absolutely not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not arguing\nthat because you need to see more about the mortgage\nsubsidiary you need to see what the parent is up to?\nMR. BLANCHARD: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMR. BLANCHARD: No, we're not. Michigan and\nthe States want to be able to help their citizens with\nabusive and predatory lending complaints.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that it was a\nnational bank. Forget the subsidiary. And your State\nsays: Well, we want to have a law here that says we\nwant to send our own bank examiners in. And moreover,\nwe don't want them to make any loans in excess of 12\npercent interest. Fine. Would that be constitutional?\nI mean, wouldn't be preempted?\nMR. BLANCHARD: As to the national bank?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. BLANCHARD: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, of course, because it\nconflicts and they don't want it.\nMR. BLANCHARD: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Do they have\nthe authority to say a subsidiary is a national bank?\nMR. BLANCHARD: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, they can't? Where is\nit in the law that says they don't have the authority to\nsay that a subsidiary of a national bank owned by a\nnational bank is a national bank? Is there something\nspecifically that stops them from saying that?\nMR. BLANCHARD: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What?\nMR. BLANCHARD: The Gold Foods case, the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is it? What is it --\nI mean, what statute or what is it that prevents them\nfrom saying it? I don't know the Gold Foods case.\nMR. BLANCHARD: Well, the point is that the\ncorporate law recognizes the two as separate and\ndistinct corporate entities.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought your point was\nthat the statute defines national bank, but also defines\naffiliates, and refers to them as two separate entities.\nMR. BLANCHARD: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I thought your point\nwas that the effect of this regulation is to simply\neliminate that distinction?\nMR. BLANCHARD: You're right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Their argument, they\nhaven't argued -- I realize this was a hypothetical, but\nthey haven't argued that the subsidiary should be\ntreated as a national bank. They're arguing that\nthey're entitled to say that the same preemption that\napplies to the national bank applies to the\nsubsidiaries.\nMR. BLANCHARD: Exactly. That's what they\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Presumably, if they\nsaid it's treated as a national bank they would lose the\nbenefit of the separate corporate existence when it came\nto issues of liability. If they said this subsidiary is\na national bank, then presumably the separate corporate\nexistence they're seeking to take advantage of would be\nobliterated.\nMR. BLANCHARD: Well, but that's the -- they\nare trying to contend that they are one and the same.\nBut they can't have their cake and eat it, too.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I guess we can ask\nthe respondents. But is it your understanding that\nrespondents take the position that the State has no\ncontrol at all over whether or not the shares have been\nproperly issued, whether or not certain accounting\nrequirements applicable to all corporations have been\ncomplied with?\nMR. BLANCHARD: Yes, that is my\nunderstanding of their position.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: They say that there's no\narea of State law that is applicable to the subsidiary\ncorporation?\nMR. BLANCHARD: They are saying that\nvisitorial powers over the State-chartered operating\nsubs is exclusively --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I could understand that\nwith reference to just the amount of consumer loans, as\nJustice Scalia was talking about. But just to see if\nthe corporation has a -- had -- had a meeting that year,\nhas duly elected its officers under State law, do the\nrespondents take the position you have no authority to\nvisit the corporation to determine that?\nMR. BLANCHARD: They take the authority --\nthe position that Michigan has no authority to impose on\nthe State-chartered operating sub the two Michigan\nlaws --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But let's -- there are\ntwo different kinds of regulations. I think\nJustice Kennedy was talking about regulations of a\nchartering State. This subsidiary was set up under the\nlaw of a State. It wasn't Michigan. Is there -- is\nanyone contesting that --was it North Carolina?\nMR. BLANCHARD: Yes, you're correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that they have to meet\nall the requirements for setting up a corporation and\nhaving meetings and all that that North Carolina\nrequires of corporations that are incorporated in that\nState?\nMR. BLANCHARD: No, I've not heard them say\nthat as to North Carolina law. But what they're saying\nis that the Michigan Mortgage Broker, Lenders and\nServicers Licensing Act and the Michigan Secondary\nMortgage Act do not apply to them.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that seems to be a\nstandard preemption case. It's not as broad as just\nvisitorial powers generally. Maybe I'm wrong. Do some\nsubsidiaries of the -- of a national bank do things\nother than banking, say title insurance or something\nlike that? I don't see anything in the record where the\nOCC wants to displace the State as to that. This is\njust a standard preemption case. When the OCC has\nregulations that control, then the State has no\nauthority to add to those regulations or to have, or to\nhave contrary regulations. But if it's something that\ndoesn't have to do with banking at all, then I suppose\nthey would say -- I can ask them -- I suppose they say\nthe State has authority to regulate.\nMR. BLANCHARD: The important point, though,\nYour Honor, is that the OCC has no independent power to\npreempt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign\nState.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Doesn't it have exactly the\nsame power that any other agency or Congress has? That\nit has the power, if its regulation is authorized, it\nhas the power to what they say, preempt a state law that\nobstructs, impairs, or conditions a bank's ability fully\nto exercise its federally authorized real estate lending\npowers? That's what they say, and then they list some\nexamples.\nSuppose they said nothing. Wouldn't we be\nin the same boat? After all, a state cannot under the\nFederal Constitution normally enact a law that\ninterferes or stands as an obstacle to the achievement\nof the objective of the Federal law.\nSo if that's right, or if it's wrong,\nexplain why it's wrong, but if it's right, why don't you\ntell me whether the two laws that you are worried about\ndo or do not stand as an obstacle to the full\nachievement of the purposes of the statute as\nimplemented by their regulation?\nMR. BLANCHARD: They do not.\nFirst of all, if the OCC -- if Congress\nintends to alter the balance that I spoke of earlier, it\nmust do so with clear and manifest language. There must\nbe unmistakably clear language that Congress intended to\nauthorize the OCC to preempt the state law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let's assume I don't agree\nwith you about that, that I think conflict preemption\ndoes not require clear language. Assume that, even\nthough you disagree with it. Now on my assumption that\nyou can have the law if it doesn't conflict, but you\ncan't have the law if it does conflict, so now you\nexplain to me why the two laws at issue here don't\nconflict.\nMR. BLANCHARD: Your Honor, in the Barnett\ncase and in the Atherton case, in order to have the kind\nof problem you're talking about, there must be a\nsignificant interference with the business of banking or\nan incapacitation of the business of banking. Our\nMichigan law doesn't incapacitate what --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Blanchard, may I ask\nyou a question, perhaps preliminary to what you are\nlaunching into? My understanding was that you did not\nquestion the OCC's regulatory authority over a unit that\nit says can do what the national bank itself could do in\nthe real estate business, no more, no less. OCC\nregulation, visitation, all the rest, OCC's regulations\nvalidly applied to this subsidiary that has been set up\nin North Carolina and is operating in Michigan; is that\nright? It is one thing for you to say we have the\nauthority to regulate. Are you saying at the same time\nthat OCC is out of the picture because its dual\nregulation conflicts with the inevitable?\nMR. BLANCHARD: I am not saying that. What\nI am saying is the OCC does not have the exclusive\nright.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ah, you're saying, you\nstarted to say they can't have their cake and eat it\ntoo, but you're saying they can have the worst of all\npossible regulatory worlds, so that they've got two\nequally competent regulators, and they have to meet the\nrequirements of both?\nMR. BLANCHARD: Yes. I am saying that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if they don't\nwant to, they don't have to set up a separate\nsubsidiary, right? They can do this business directly\nas a national bank and they're not going to be subject\nto any visitation?\nMR. BLANCHARD: You are absolutely correct.\nAs I started to say earlier, they made that choice and\nthey came to Michigan, and they obtained a certificate\nof authority from the Michigan Corporations Division as\na foreign for-profit corporation doing business in the\nstate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And I would\nhave thought your answer to Justice Breyer was yes, that\nthey get to regulate to the extent they want to, and the\nstate does, and if there's a conflict, the federal\nregulation will prevail, but what's the problem here is\nthat they're issuing a categorical regulation saying the\nstate can't regulate at all.\nMR. BLANCHARD: Yes. They are claiming\nexclusive preemptive authority.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand that\nyou made this --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just finish, please?\nYou argued, as I understand it, correctly, that the\nstate does, exercises certain regulatory controls that\nwill not be exercised -- will not be replaced by federal\ncontrols; is that right? In other words, you -- that\nthey will be unregulated to a certain extent? There\nwill be less regulation under the federal sovereign than\nthere is under the state; is that correct?\nMR. BLANCHARD: You are correct, Your Honor,\nin that Wachovia Mortgage as a subsidiary of a national\nbank is a registrant under Michigan law. And as a\nregistrant, it is not subject to an annual --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can you give me some\nspecific examples of what Michigan would require that\nthe OCC does not require? You mentioned licensing, for\nexample.\nMR. BLANCHARD: Michigan would require\nWachovia Mortgage to register. There's a difference\nbetween registration and licensure. As a subsidiary of\nWachovia Bank, they are a registrant like they've been\nfor the last --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does that have any impact\non the way they run their business?\nMR. BLANCHARD: No.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I mean, does it make any\ndifference as a matter of what they have to do in order\nto comply with the law that they are now exempt from\nMichigan rules and subject to Federal rules instead?\nMR. BLANCHARD: No. Michigan just wants to\nbe able to -- and the other states -- to deal with fraud\nand deceit and material misrepresentation in mortgage\ntransactions, and to have a say over the corporations\nthat come to their state and do business.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Blanchard, if I could\ngo back to what you were saying before this last line of\nquestioning, I didn't understand your position to be\nthat the OCC can come in and regulate this non-Federal\nbank up to the point where its -- well, can do it\napparently without limitation. And where its regulation\nconflicts with the state regulation, the Federal\nprevails.\nMR. BLANCHARD: Or the more restrictive.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ah, or the more\nrestrictive.\nMR. BLANCHARD: That's the difference.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Federal Government says\nyou can have outstanding loans of $10 billion and the\nstate says no, you can have outstanding loans of\n8 billion.\nMR. BLANCHARD: No, Your Honor, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. What happens in that\nsituation?\nMR. BLANCHARD: Well, it doesn't happen in\nMichigan because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, invent some other\nhypothetical then. I'm talking about a situation in\nwhich the Federal law is more permissive than the state\nlaw. Which law prevails? The Federal law allows this\nbank to do things which the state law would not allow it\nto do. As I understood your prior answer, you say oh,\nof course, if the Federal law allows to it do things the\nstate law doesn't allow to it do, the Federal law\nprevails. I didn't understand that to be your position.\nAnd if it is your position, I don't know what all this\nfuss is about. That's the end of the game, isn't it?\nMR. BLANCHARD: No, Your Honor. You see,\nin -- we do not conduct -- they are exempt from an\nexamination where we go in and look yearly at such\nthings as capital assets management, earnings,\nliquidity. Those aren't the kinds of things that we're\ntalking about. They, as a registrant, they are exempt\nfrom that, from an annual examination. They're not\nincapacitated, nor are --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exempt from state\nexamination?\nMR. BLANCHARD: Yes. The state chartered\ncorporation, Wachovia Mortgage, is exempt under Michigan\nlaw from an annual examination.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We're not looking for that.\nWe're looking for the opposite. As I read this, the\nbanking agency has not said, we wipe out all of your\nlaws. They've said, we wipe out a subset of laws, which\nare defined as those laws that obstruct, impair, or\nlimit the ability of this bank to fulfill its federally\nmandated powers. Okay? So they're just saying, we only\nget the ones that are in conflict. Now, they then have\na list of which ones they preempt and which ones they\ndon't. So my question to you is, give me a list here of\nwhich ones they think conflict that you think don't.\nMR. BLANCHARD: They -- their position is\nthat both laws that we append to our brief, both laws in\ntheir entirety, are preempted.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Their position is\nnot that it only preempts in cases of conflict. Under\n12c apart, 7.4006, it says, state laws apply to national\nbank operated subsidiaries, which is what we're dealing\nwith here, to the same extent that those laws apply to\nthe parent national bank, which is to say not at all.\nMR. BLANCHARD: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's not a case\nof conflict preemption. They're trying to preempt state\nlaw whether it conflicts or not, right?\nMR. BLANCHARD: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You do have -- one thing\nthat seems concrete and clear to me -- correct me if I\nget this wrong -- Michigan is kind of deferring to OCC\nin its primary jurisdiction sense. It says customers,\nif you've got complaints about what this operating\nsubsidiary is doing, you go first to the OCC; and then\nif we think -- we, Michigan -- thinks OCC has not given\nyou an adequate response to your complaint, we take\nover.\nMR. BLANCHARD: You are exactly correct.\nThat's the Michigan regulatory --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's kind of a reverse\nsupremacy. Where it's usually the feds that have the\nlast word, but here you're saying Michigan has decided\nthat it will let OCC go first and Michigan will be kind\nof a supervisor for the adequacy of the OCC's handling\nof the consumer's complaint?\nMR. BLANCHARD: Yes, you are exactly\ncorrect. Our regulatory framework in Michigan says that\nthe complaint is referred to the appropriate Federal\nagency, and only if that complaint is not being\nadequately pursued does the commissioner have that\nwindow of investigative authority for her to pursue it.\nIt is a cooperative type of statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know another\narrangement where the Federal agency goes first but then\nthe state agency has authority to say Federal agency,\nyou didn't deal with this consumer adequately, so we\nwill take over? I know schemes that work the other way\nwhere the state goes first, and then the Federal\nauthority, but do you know another one?\nMR. BLANCHARD: Another one that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where the primary\nadjudicator, decision-maker would be the Federal\nauthority, but then the state can override that if it\nthinks the Federal authority hasn't done an adequate\njob?\nMR. BLANCHARD: Well, in a sense, in our\nstatute, the commissioner of the state agency is able to\ninvestigate if the complaint referred to the comptroller\nhas not been adequately --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not the question.\nJustice Ginsburg is trying to find out if you know any\nother situation where when the Federal agency doesn't do\nan adequate job, the state agency comes in?\nMR. BLANCHARD: No situations come directly\nto mind.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe civil rights actions\nwhere there's a Federal agency that has some remedial\npowers and if the Federal agency doesn't act, the\ncitizen is free to bring litigation in state court? I\nguess that would be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or environmental\nregulation where just because the Federal EPA doesn't\ntake a particular action against a polluter, doesn't\nmean that the state can't take action against the\npolluter.\nMR. BLANCHARD: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't the action an\ninadequate action? Michigan is saying yeah, the Federal\nauthority can do with respect to this unit just what it\nwould do to a national bank itself, but if we think that\nis inadequate, that is a question of just one act or the\nother, but if the -- it is the state judging the\nadequacy of a particular Federal response.\nMR. BLANCHARD: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the Federal\nU.S. Attorney prosecutes, decides to prosecute someone\nfor manslaughter, the state can decide that's not an\nadequate enough response and prosecute them for murder,\nright?\nMR. BLANCHARD: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could the OCC --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did this go through your --\ncan I just ask --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Sure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This still goes to the same\nthing. Does Michigan do this by grace? If Michigan\nwanted to, could it just tell the feds to butt out and\nsay, you know, all these years we've been letting you\ncome in first, and we only step in when we think you\nhaven't done a good job, but we've had it.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Especially after this\nlawsuit, get out, we're going to regulate our state\nbanks?\nMR. BLANCHARD: No, Your Honor. That would\nbe contrary to the express statutory scheme in Michigan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I know in Michigan. I'm\nsaying, could Michigan change its statutory scheme to\nkick the Feds out? Or would that be prevented by this\nFederal statute we're discussing here? I'm trying to\nsee what you think this Federal statute does. Or what\nthe --\nMR. BLANCHARD: The Federal rule provides\nthat the operating -- the State chartered operating subs\nare to be treated just like the law pertaining to the\nparent national bank. And there is no authority from\nCongress given to the OCC that kind of rule. The OCC\nonly has the authority that Congress gives it, either\nthrough a preemptive statute or through the dell\ndesignation of preemptive authority; and Congress has\nnot given them that kind of power.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask the question --\nthe regulatory question. You do not dispute Michigan\ndoes not dispute that the operating -- well, strike\nthat.\nMichigan does not dispute that national\nbanks can go into business of real estate loans?\nAnd Michigan does not dispute that Congress\nhas authorized national banks to operate through\nsubsidiaries for specific purposes like this.\nMy question is can you give me any plausible\nreason to think that Congress would have contemplated\nthis system of potentially more restrictive State\nlegislation when its national bank in a given instance\ndecides to do -- to exercise its Federal banking power\nthrough a subsidiary rather than directly?\nCan you think of any reason that Congress\nwould have contemplated the scheme that you're, that\nyou're defending?\nMR. BLANCHARD: Well, first of all, Your\nHonor, I'm not defending that Michigan has a more\nrestrictive scheme or that Michigan law in any way\nincapacitates or significantly interferes with the\nbusiness of banking.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if, if -- if the\nbanks have got, let's say, a subsidiary has to go\nthrough two rounds of bank inspection every year instead\nof one round, it is going to cost them something.\nRegulation costs the regulated entity something. It is\na burden on them.\nAnd we also have to assume that there may be\ninstances -- you brought it up -- in, in which the, the\n-- the State burden is heavier. So with those\npossibilities in mind, can you think of any reason why\nCongress in authorizing the exercise of the Federal\nbanking power through a subsidiary would have\ncontemplated Michigan or any State would have this\nauthority?\nIt seems counterintuitive to me. They're\nsaying you can -- - you can -- you banks can exercise\nthe Federal banking power through a subsidiary. It\nwould seem strange to me that Congress would silently\nsay, \"and, of course, we acquiesce to a -- a dual system\nof regulation that would not apply to the bank itself.\"\nWhat reason would Congress have had for\nassuming that might be the result?\nMR. BLANCHARD: A recognition that the\nStates have a sovereign, compelling and legitimate\ninterest in regulating those corporations that it\ncharters and that do business within its borders. And\n-- and that that balance should be respected.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So it is state sovereign\nimmunity in effect, is the answer -- State sovereignty\nis rather the answer?\nMR. BLANCHARD: But the - but the key point,\nand I would like to reserve whatever time I may have.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You better hurry\nthen.\nMR. BLANCHARD: The key, the key point is\nthat Congress has distinguished clearly and\nunequivocally between affiliates and national banks; but\nit has not included affiliates in either Section 481 or\n484 of the National Bank Act.\nNational banks are not synonymous or\nequivalent to the State-chartered operating\nsubsidiaries.\nTHE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Blanchard.\nMr. Long?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. LONG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court.\nI would like to start with the question that\nJustice Souter asked because there are some important\nprinciples that are really not disputed in this case,\nand I think they help to focus the issue that is before\nthe Court.\nThere is no dispute, as we understand it,\nthat mortgage lending by national banks is supervised\nexclusively by the Comptroller of the Currency. And\nthere is also no dispute that national banks' incidental\npowers under Section 247 include the power to make\nmortgage loans through a operating subsidiary. And an\nadditional point is that both Federal statutes and\nFederal regulations state that when national banks make\nmortgage loans or exercise their banking powers through\nsubsidiaries they do so subject to the same terms and\nconditions that apply to the exercise of the power by\nthe national --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Blanchard, may I ask\nyou a question. I just want to understand. Wachovia\nhas branch banks all over the country. Are they\ngenerally subsidiaries or are they divisions of the\nbank?\nMR. LONG: Well, a branch of a national bank\nhas a particular status under Section 36 of the National\nBank Act.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand that. I'm\nasking a factual question.\nMR. LONG: It would not be separately\nincorporated. So --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They are actually\ndivisions, in effect, of the national bank itself?\nMR. LONG: Well, I think they are generally\nreferred to as branches but I think its would be more a\ndivision. That would be --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: At least they are not\nseparate corporate subsidiaries.\nMR. LONG: That -- that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why is that, that the Best\nbank decided to use the subsidiary approach for this\nbusiness, rather than the more traditional banking\napproach.\nMR. LONG: Well, of course, anything that a\nbank does through an operating subsidiary it could do\nthrough the bank. It can always do it through the bank.\nBut there are many reasons why a bank may choose an\noperating subsidiary. They can be managerial reasons;\nit's -- just sometimes works better as matter of\nbusiness management.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It protects from\nliability, too.\nMR. LONG: Well, that is one of the reasons.\nAlthough --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- in the district.\nMR. LONG: I will say, Justice Stevens, I\nhave not been able to find examples of national bank\noperating subsidiaries that have become insolvent. They\nare regulated very heavily by the Comptroller and so\nthey don't.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you have a\nsubsidiary that's in the mortgage lending business that\npresumably competes with other companies in the mortgage\nlending business that are not associated with national\nbanks, and you're claiming an immunity from the\nregulation that their competitors are subject to. Is\nthat right?\nMR. LONG: Well, but again, Mr. Chief\nJustice, the national banks compete. And its undisputed\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's fine, and\nthey have an express provision in 48 -- 484(a) that says\nthey're, they're exempt from regulation. The question\nis whether a separate subsidiary that is not a national\nbank that competes with other mortgage lending companies\nis immune from the regulation that those other\ncompanies --\nMR. LONG: But again, Mr. Chief Justice,\nthrifts, S&Ls, State-Chartered banks in all 50 States\nare permitted to have operating subsidiaries. It's\nrecognized not just for national banks, but really for\nall types of banking institutions, that are operating\nsubsidiaries are a useful tool of banking. This is not\na sort of special privilege that's given --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Breyer's\nquestions were pointing out, to the extent your\nregulation -- the Federal regulation of your subsidiary\nconflicts with the State law, that regulation is going\nto prevail. The question is whether or not you are\nimmune from State regulation across the board --\nMR. LONG: Well, and you asked that\nquestion. I mean, I think it might be useful to think\nfirst about national banks and then about the operating\nsubsidiaries. It is not true that there are no State\nlaws that apply to national banks.\nThis Court's unanimous Barnett Bank decision\nis the clearest statement of the principle. Any State\nlaws that prevent or significantly impair or impede the\nexercise of national banking powers are preempted. But\nmany State laws having to do with contracts --\nJUSTICE ALITO: In real world terms, what's\ninvolved here? What are examples of some of the things\nthat Michigan does or some other State does that impair\nor impede the operations to the --\nMR. LONG: The beginning is, it is a\ncomplete separate set of regulation. You have to\nregister or obtain a license. You have to submit to\nexamination by the regulator. Investigation.\nEnforcement. There are substantive laws; Michigan has\nsome that are not directly at issue in this case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of those laws\nmight be, I mean, let's say they have a law, when you're\nissuing a mortgage to a consumer, you have to give them\na disclosure about how much they're going to end up\npaying over the life of the loan and all that. And they\nrequire that of anybody who issues a mortgage in\nMichigan. Could that law be applied to your subsidiary?\nMR. LONG: Well, the question, Mr. Chief\nJustice, would be is it preempted as to the national\nbank? The Comptroller of the Currency would say yes.\nBut the issue in this case is if it is preempted as to\nthe national bank, then it is also preempted when the\nnational bank chooses to exercise this power that it has\nunder Section 24 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't -- isn't your\nfriend correct then? You are really trying to have your\ncake and eat it, too. You're saying if we did this\nwithout a subsidiary, we wouldn't be subject to that.\nBut you want to be able to operate through a subsidiary\nand yet not be subject to the same rules that apply to\nother people.\nMR. LONG: Well, but it, it with respect, it\nis not really a case of having our cake and eating it,\ntoo. We are in the area of powers of national banks.\nAnd the Court has recognized for a century that in that\narea, when national banks have powers, including\nincidental powers recognized by the Comptroller, they\ngenerally preempt any State law that prevents or\nsignificantly interferes --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the question I had.\nI got somewhat thrown by the Chief Justice's question,\nbecause I thought first, when I read the reg, 34.4.ab,\nthat those things that are preempted are those things\nthat obstruct, impair or condition, or in other words\nlimit, the Federal powers of a national bank.\nMR. LONG: That, that is correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I thought we were\nbasically dealing with conflict --\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- not fielding.\nMR. LONG: It's -- that's one level --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But -- but the last part of\nthe reg says that what applies, no State law applies to\na national bank operating subsidiary if it doesn't apply\nto the parent bank. And I began to think it fields\npreemption. Am I right in thinking that it is conflict\npreemption, not field, because it is conflict in the\ncase of a national bank?\nMR. LONG: Well -- it's, it's a very\nimportant point. And our position is there are actually\nseveral ways in which you could analyze this case and\narrive at the conclusion that the Comptroller's\nregulations are valid. One is looking simply at\nstatutory language and saying we would, we the Court\nwould reach this result as we did in the Franklin\nNational Bank case even without any regulation. And\nsecond of all is to say the regulations are a reasonable\ninterpretation of the statute. A third is to say that\nthe Comptroller has broad rulemaking authority. And as\nthis Court recognized in De La Cuesta and many other\ncases, an agency exercising its rulemaking authority can\npreempt State laws even though the statute itself would\nnot --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think, the question is\nnot whether it can preempt State laws but whether the\nrulemaking authority can, can eliminate a, a basic\ndivision of the statute into a national bank and\naffiliates of the national bank. The statute makes a\nclear distinction between the two. And the effect of\nwhat, of what the agency has to done here is simply to\neliminate that distinction, and to say really it doesn't\nmatter.\nMR. LONG: No. It -- I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you are an affiliate of\na national bank, you have the same immunity that the\nnational bank has. That's not what the statute says.\nMR. LONG: I have a two-part answer to that\nquestion, Justice Scalia. One is that Section 484 of\nthe section you're referring to does limit the\nvisitorial authority as to national banks, but it is\nsilent as to operating subsidiaries or any other type of\naffiliate. States do exercise visitorial authority over\nsome affiliates of national banks. That's established.\nOperating subsidiaries are a special type of affiliate;\n484, which was enacted during the Civil War, a hundred\nyears before operating subsidiaries were authorized,\nreally doesn't address the question of visitorial\nauthority.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, an operating\nsubsidiary is an affiliate, right? What kind of\naffiliates did they have before they had operating\nsubsidiaries? Did they rent pool halls, or what?\nMR. LONG: It's a type of affiliate --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought that\nany affiliate of a national bank would, would be engaged\nin essentially banking business.\nMR. LONG: But, but this really became\nclear, in answer to your question, in part two of my\nanswer. In 1999 when Congress enacted the\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act, it directly addressed this\nquestion of affiliates of national banks. And this is\non page 2A of our appendix. It refers to, it created a\nnew type of affiliate, for the first time, financial\nsubsidiaries which can do anything financial in nature.\nSo they can actually engage in activities that the\nparent national bank could not.\nBut if you look at the bottom of page 2A of\nour appendix, this is Section 24A now of the act, it\nsaid that financial subsidiaries can also engage in\nactivities that are permitted for national banks to\nengage in directly, subject to the same terms and\nconditions that govern the conduct of the activities by\na national bank.\nAnd then at the bottom of 3A and going over\nto 4A where they actually define financial subsidiaries,\nthey do so by distinguishing them from the operating\nsubsidiaries which had existed for decades. And at the\ntop of 4A you see that the operating subsidiary again\nengages only in activities that the national banks may\nengage in directly and are conducted subject to the same\nterms and conditions.\nThen if you'll bear with me a moment longer,\non page 12A of our appendix some additional provisions\nof GLBA -- actually, that's the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act,\nGLBA people call it -- said -- this is on 12A -- that\nsecurities activities and insurance activities,\nactivities that have been traditionally subject to State\nregulation, if they're engaged in by a functionally\nregulated subsidiary, operating subsidiary or a\nfinancial subsidiary, then they may be regulated by\nrelevant State securities authorities or State insurance\nauthorities.\nSo Congress was actually quite specific.\nI mean, your question is about statutory language. You\ndon't find this in 484, which is, since it's a century\nold, doesn't really get into this. But in this 1999\nstatute, it's all about subsidiaries of national banks.\nCongress was pretty clear if it's securities, if it's\ninsurance, it can be regulated by States. They were\nspecific about that. If it's a banking activity that\nthe bank itself can undertake, it's subject to the same\nterms and conditions.\nAnd so, going back to the Chief\nJustice's question, you have this question of would it\nbe a preempted State preempted state law if it were\napplied to the national bank when the national bank is\nmaking a mortgage loan. Not every State law is\npreempted because not every State law conflicts. But if\nit does --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What authority\ndo you have for the proposition that when then Federal\nlaw says subject to the same terms and conditions that\nthey're referring To State regulation as opposed to the\nsame Federal regulation that applies to the national\nbanks?\nMR. LONG: Well, I mean, we have section\n7.4006, which is the 0CC's regulation interpreting that\nlanguage in the statute and in its own OPSUB\nregulations, section 5.34. And we also relied simply on\nthe ordinary meaning of \"terms and conditions.\" It\nmeans prerequisites, limitations.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was 7.4006 issued\npursuant to -- what did you call it, GLBA?\nMR. LONG: GLBA?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. Or did it\npredate that?\nMR. LONG: 7.4006 was issued pursuant to\n24-7, which is this incidental powers provision, and\n24(a), which I've just been walking you through, which\nis a provision of GLBA. So it is based partly upon\nGLBA, and it is an interpretation of the same terms and\nconditions language.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Conflict preemption\nbasically strikes down a State law that stands as an\nobstacle to the full enforcement of the Federal law.\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, with that\nin mind, suppose that you didn't have either 7.4006 or\n34.4(a)(B). Neither existed. But we listened to what\nthe agency said as a Court and they explained how the\nregulation worked. Would you expect to come to\nprecisely the same result?\nMR. LONG: Well, I mean, of course --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would you or not?\nMR. LONG: We do have them and we think that\nmakes the case easier, of course.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know, but would you --\nwould you expect to come to the same result or not?\nMR. LONG: Yes. We would say that if you\nstart with 24-7 and the incidental powers of national\nbanks and the undisputed point that one of those\nincidental powers is for the national bank --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How does it conflict\nwith Federal banking authority for the State to audit\nthe books of the mortgage subsidiary?\nMR. LONG: Well, it has been established\nsince the beginning of the national banking system\nthat -- and this goes back to the history of the first\nand second Bank of the United States in McCullough\nagainst Maryland -- that the national banking system is\nprotected from possibly unfriendly State legislation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Take my earlier case\nabout the consumer disclosure. Michigan has a law, I\nassume, that any mortgage lender has to tell the\nconsumer all this information. Would that conflict with\nthe authority of a national bank?\nMR. LONG: The Comptroller's view as I\nunderstand it is that it would. But again let me\nemphasize --\nTHE COURT: How?\nMR. LONG: Because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think any\nregulation would conflict with the national bank status?\nMR. LONG: Well, I think that may go too\nfar. But I think what Comptroller has done, it has --\nhas been to look at a series of these State regulations\nand determine whether in fact they do impair or impede\nthe exercise --\nTHE COURT: I'm trying to get a handle on\nit. As I understood the case that came, I don't think\nthere's disagreement on either side about how conflict\npreemption works. But I thought your position was that\nmore is involved here and that the State can't regulate\nit at all, and you're not getting into a conflict\npreemption question. It's just if it's a State\nregulation it can't --\nMR. LONG: I think our position is there are\nmultiple roots that we can win this case. One is based\non conflict preemption. Another --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you do take a field\npreemption position, don't you?\nMR. LONG: Yes, of course. And another\nroute is simply that the agency has --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I mean, it's truly broader\nthan just conflict preemption.\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Literally.\nMR. LONG: Yes. And the agency has broad\nrulemaking power. It's exercised it here. There's\nreally no dispute about what the OCC's rules mean. The\nonly question is whether they're valid and then what is\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your best case for\nthe proposition that an agency and not the Congress\ndefines the extent of field preemption?\nMR. LONG: That an agency and not the --\ncertainly the Delaquesta line of cases stand for the\nproposition that if an agency has preempted State law by\nregulation, the questions are simply whether the agency\nhas acted within the scope of its delegated authority\nand whether it is a reasonable accommodation of the\nconflicting principles and whether there's any reason to\nthink that Congress would have disagreed with it. Are\nthere -- I mean, there are examples. For example, in\nthe world of Federal thrifts OTS has a sort of field\npreemption as I understand it. It's evolved differently\nin the world of national banks. That's conflict\npreemption.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is a functionally\nregulated subsidiary of a depository institution.\nMR. LONG: Well, that that again goes to\nthis scheme of GLBA that I was trying to describe. The\nnotion that Congress had is that you're going to\nregulate by function. So if it's insurance, the State\ncan regulate it whether it's in the subsidiary or in the\nbank. If it's securities, the SEC and in some\ncircumstances the States can regulate it. But if it's\ncore banking functions like mortgage lending, that's\ngoing to be regulated subject to the same terms and\nconditions that apply when the bank itself conducts\nthose activities.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And is that a functionally\nregulated subsidiary?\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUST SCALIA: If it's just engaging in\nbanking activities?\nMR. LONG: That is the concept as I\nunderstand it. It's going by function and we think that\nshows actually Congress did --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does Wachovia have any\nbranch banks in Michigan?\nMR. LONG: Wachovia does not, although -- I\nmean, an interesting feature of the Michigan law is if\nthey did Michigan's law would not apply, which we think\nis not consistent with their view that the OCC is an\ninadequate regulator, because it would be exactly the\nsame whether or not there's a branch.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are there States in which\nWachovia has both branch banks and subsidiaries\ncomparable to this?\nMR. LONG: Yes, yes. North Carolina and\nothers.\nI will add, there was a point at the\nbeginning that this Wachovia Mortgage Company actually\nwas regulated by Michigan for 6 years and there were no\nproblems. During that period it was a subsidiary of a\nbank holding company, and that's a completely different\nsituation. Those are not regulated at all by the OCC.\nSo of course they were regulated by Michigan. That's\nthe way subsidiaries of bank holding companies are\nregulated. That's simply a different situation.\nIf there are no further questions, I will --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Long.\nMr. Srinivasan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUSCURIAE,\nSUPPORTING RESPONDENTS\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nLet me begin by addressing this question of\nwhether what's going on here is conflict preemption or\nfield preemption. Now, it depends on how one defines\nthose terms. But as we understand it it's conflict\npreemption, not field preemption, in the following\nsense. Our position is not that State laws have no\napplication to operating subsidiaries or to national\nbanks for that matter. It's that State laws apply to\nthe same extent to operating subsidiaries as they would\nto national banks. And as this court has made clear in\nthe Atherton case and in the Barnett Bank case, State\nlaws do apply to national banks and operating\nsubsidiaries in a variety of respects, and State\ncontract law would be an example. But with operating\nsubsidiaries in particular, State laws dealing with\ncorporate governance questions, for example the process\nof incorporation, dissolution, shareholder voting, and\nthings of that sort, would be controlling and so federal\nlaw doesn't control those sorts of aspects.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's field\npreemption when it comes to regulation. Yes, if the\nbank is sued the normal rules of contract are going to\napply for enforcing a contract. But you're claiming\nfield preemption with respect to regulation, correct?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I guess it depends on\nthe degree to which the regulations apply to the\nnational banks. That's my only point, is that State\nlaws apply to the same extent to the operating\nsubsidiary as to the national bank.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: State laws generally\n-- State agencies generally don't regulate national\nbanks at all, right?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: State agencies don't\ngenerally do that because there's a specific statutory\nprohibition on that. And Justice Scalia, this goes to\nyour questions about the scope of these provisions at 12\nU.S.C. 484(a) and 481. It's true that those provisions\nsay by their terms that visitorial authority resides\nexclusively with the Comptroller of the Currency with\nrespect to national banks, and there's another provision\nthat deals with affiliates.\nAnd so that's the point with visitorial\nauthority. But visitorial authority by its very nature\nis asserted in service of and enforcement of some\nunderlying substantive requirement, and the underlying\nsubstantive requirement at issue here is the requirement\nthat operating subsidiaries register with the State.\nAnd so there's a question of conflict preemption that\napplies both to the national bank and the operating\nsubsidiary of whether that underlying substantive\nregistration requirement could be applied to the\nnational bank or could be applied to the operating\nsubsidiary.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but it is true, is it\nnot, that as long as this mortgage company was a\nsubsidiary of a holding company rather than the bank\nitself, the State would have done the visiting, the\nvisitorial power, whereas once they changed the Federal\nGovernment assumed that responsibility?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't know what you\nmean by \"holding company,\" Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, as your co-counsel\npointed out, previously this very company was a\nsubsidiary of a holding company that also owned the\nbank, and at that time it was exclusively regulated by\nMichigan.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right, because it\nwasn't an operating subsidiary of a federally chartered\nnational bank.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the change in the\ncorporate structure is the sole basis for saying now\nit's exclusively regulated by the OCC?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It is, but it's changing\nthe corporate structure in a fundamentally important\nway. That's that it's no owned and controlled by a\nfederally chartered national bank.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But this results in field\npreemption to the extent that the exercise of visitorial\npower is a regulatory function?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, again it depends on\nhow one defines those terms. And I don't take issue\nwith the fact that as a consequence of the fact that\nthis became a subsidiary --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it is now only the\nFederal agency that does the visiting, whereas it used\nto be only the State agency?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the question that led\nme to is how many additional personnel did OOC employ\nwhen it took over this area for 48 States?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't have an\nempirical answer to that question.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it was certainly quite\na few people, I assume.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: But Justice Stevens, in the\nregulatory materials that attended the promulgation of\nthese rules OCC specifically addressed the question\nwhether it had sufficient resources to exercise\noversight authority over operating subsidiaries of\nnational banks. And let's be clear. It's not that the\nOCC previously had no authority over operating\nsubsidiaries. The question is whether the OCC has\nexclusive authority over operating subsidiaries. And\nthe OCC determined in the regulatory materials that it\nhad sufficient resources to exercise oversight authority\nover operating subsidiaries --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the authority under\nthe old regime was just to make sure that the operation\ndid not affect the financial stability of the parent\nbank.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: But that's because it\nwasn't an operating subsidiary of a federally chartered\nnational bank, and that changes things in a fundamental\nway for the following reason: That under the Barnett\nBank case the rule of preemption, the special rule of\npreemption that applies in the context of national\nbanking, is that when you're dealing with enumerated or\nincidental powers of national banks -- and one\nincidental power of a national bank is undisputed to be\nthe power to conduct affairs through an operating\nsubsidiary -- that the grants of those powers are\nnormally preemptive of rather than preempted by State\nlaw> And so once the operating --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was an effort\nof the State to prohibit the national bank from engaging\nin the activity, correct?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that was. But the\nCourt --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's an obvious\ncase of conflict preemption. Here we have a question of\nwhether or not the State can regular the operating\nsubsidiary to any extent.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: But the Court's decisions\naren't limited to prohibitions of that sort. I'd make\ntwo points in that regard. First of all, in one sense\nthis is a prohibition, because the operating subsidiary\ncan't engage in federally authorized activities unless\nand until it gets the State's permission. So at least\nthere is a prohibition at the outset. But more\nimportantly, the Court's cases aren't limited to\nsituations involving prohibitions of the sort that Your\nHonor posits, because in the Franklin National Bank case\nthat was a situation in which the national bank had the\npower to accept savings deposits and the State law that\nwas deemed to be preempted there didn't prohibit the\nnational bank from accepting savings deposits.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What comes next? Can the\nOCC say, well, the corporate law of this State doesn't\nreally allow subsidiaries to do as much as we think a\nsubsidiary of a national bank ought to be able to do, so\nwe're going to attribute additional corporate powers to\nthis subsidiary? Can it do that?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, not if you're talking\nabout corporate powers, because those are governed by\nState law. What it could do, though, is regulate the\nsubsidiary's conduct of the business of banking,\nbecause, after all, an operating subsidiary has one\npurpose and one purpose only, and that's to carry out\nfunctions that the national bank itself could perform.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What troubles me, and maybe\nyou can answer to it more specifically than you have, is\nthat the core function of a banking regulatory agency is\nthe visitation power, and the Banking Act makes it very\nclear that there is visitation power to national banks\nand makes it very clear that there is not for\nsubsidiaries.\nAnd here is a regulation which under the\nguise, it seems to me, of defining the powers of the\nnational bank simply eliminates that distinction. And\nit seems to me that perhaps goes beyond what an agency\nregulation is allowed to do.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: With respect,\nJustice Scalia, I don't think the statutes say that at\nall. There is a statute, 484(a), that says that the\nOCC's visitorial authority is exclusive with respect to\nnational banks. But there is no statute that says that\nthe OCC's visitorial authority is not exclusive with\nrespect to subsidiaries. There's another statute that\ndeals with affiliates. Now one point is that affiliates\nare not limited to subsidiaries, but they could include\nfor example, I guess brother and sister corporations for\nlack of a better term, that are controlled by a common\nparent. But another point is that at the time these\nstatutes were enacted, Congress simply didn't have\nwithin its field of vision the notion that a national\nbank would have the power to exercise its functions\nthrough a subsidiary corporation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why should we assume\nthat they wanted to preempt state laws to that extent.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Because what Congress was\ntrying to do is to make sure that the OCC had exclusive\nvisitorial authority with respect to the conduct of\nnational bank function. It's just at the time that\nthese statutes were enacted, the only play that national\nbank functions were being conducted was by a national\nbank itself. Now later on, when the laws of all 50\nstates, the OTS, the Federal Reserve with respect to\nstate member banks, and the comptroller gives banks the\nauthority to conduct national -- to conduct bank\nfunctions through its subsidiaries, then this issue\narises about who exercises visitorial authority with\nrespect to the conduct of those functions for a\nsubsidiary. And it stands to reason that if the\nbaseline rule is that with respect to the conduct of\nnational bank functions through a national bank itself,\nthe OCC visitorial authority is exclusive, then when a\nnational bank exercises its Federal entitlement to\nconduct those very same functions through an operating\nsubsidiary, the OCC's visitorial authority, likewise,\nwould be exclusive. That seems to me to be an entirely\nreasonable regulatory determination by the comptroller,\nand there's nothing in those statutory provisions that\nspeaks directly to that issue and that in any way\nprecludes the comptroller from reaching that\ndetermination.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Practically, is there any\ndifference between the way they operated when they were\njust a corporation as before, and now a parent and sub?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, there could be. I\ndon't know about this particular case but there\nabsolutely could be, Justice Ginsburg, because when they\nbecome subsidiaries they are controlled by the national\nbank and not by some other entity. And the reason that\na national bank would choose to engage in this sort of\nstructure rather than folding the enterprise into the\nbank itself are many fold. And in part it's for\nefficiency purposes because you can have focused\nmanagement, especially when you're dealing with the sort\nof specialized things that operating subsidiaries\ntypically do. But there's also other reasons. For\nexample, there's a modularity component to this in the\nsense that the best specialized functions such as\nmortgage lending, very often a national bank will\npurchase an entity that conducts that activity, and may\nbe interested in selling the entity later, and it's much\nmore straightforward to do that if those functions are\nmaintained in a separate subsidiary corporation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any aspect\nof state law, including liability limitation, that they\nwant to take advantage of by establishing a subsidiary\nchartered under state law, Michigan or another state,\nand yet they're claiming immunity from all other state\nregulations?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, with respect to\nliability limitation in particular, Mr. Chief Justice, I\nshould clarify that veil piercing principles and things\nof that sort would be governed by state law with respect\nto the operating subsidiary. So if the question is\nwhether the corporate veil is pierced, state law would\ndictate an answer to that question.\nBut, may I just finish one thought?\nStates won't have an incentive to liberally\nconstrue veil piercing principles with respect to\nnational banks precisely because state member banks in\nall 50 states also have operating subsidiaries through\nwhich they charter banks to conduct banking functions.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Blanchard, you have a minute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOHN BLANCHARD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BLANCHARD: Two key points.\nFirst, Section 484 and 481 have been amended\nsubsequent to the time operating subsidiaries came into\nplay. Congress knew of operating subsidiaries when it\namended 484 twice in the 1980s, and 481 was amended four\ntimes. Yet, never did Congress insert the word\n\"affiliates\" into the exclusive power of the OCC in 488.\nSecondly, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act is\nbeing greatly distorted. The same terms and conditions\nlanguage that my opponent referred to was meant to\nreturn op subs only to the authority that the parent\nbank could engage in. It wasn't preemptive or meant to\npreempt the states. The comptroller had issued a\nruling, 34.F, (f), and they had allowed operating\nsubsidiaries to do things differently from the parent\nbank.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
