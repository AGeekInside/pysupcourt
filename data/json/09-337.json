        "content": "(10:09 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear\nargument this morning in Case 09-337, Krupski v. Costa\nCrociere, S.p.A.\nMr. Bendure.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. BENDURE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BENDURE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case revolves around Rule 15(c)(1)(C)\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In pertinent\npart, if two subsections are -- are satisfied, the rule\npermits relation back of an amendment adding a new\ndefendant after expiration of the limitations period.\nThe courts below found, and Respondent does\nnot question, that we satisfied the first subsection:\nNotice and no prejudice. That arose from the service of\nthe original complaint upon Costa Cruise, the agent and\ncorporate affiliate represented by the same attorney as\nRespondent Costa Crociere.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know, Mr. Bendure,\nwhat exactly the corporate relationship was between the\ntwo?\nMR. BENDURE: No, Your Honor, not the\ncorporate relation. The functional relationship as\ndescribed in the affidavit is that Costa Cruise is the\nbooking agent for Costa Crociere. And for the notice\nprocedure, according to the affidavit of Mr. Klutz,\nCosta Cruise engaged the IRSI adjustment service to\nresolve claims arising on the ship. So in that respect\nit was also, in our view, an agent of Costa Crociere.\nBut the specific corporate relationship is not known.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Thank you.\nMR. BENDURE: Because of that timely service\non Costa Cruise, we satisfied the first subsection. And\nas this Court noted in Schiavone, timely service on one\ndefendant may serve to give imputed notice to a related\ndefendant, which is what we have here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your --\nyour client tripped over the cable, right?\nMR. BENDURE: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the case\nwere there were two people behind her and she was\npushed? And she didn't know which one pushed her, Jones\nor Smith. So she sues Jones, and Smith knows all about\nit because, of course, he's a key witness or whatever.\nCan he be substituted later on because he was the person\nshe should have sued?\nMR. BENDURE: If you're talking about a lack\nof knowledge of the real name, probably --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not just the real\nname. It's not that Jones pushed her, but his real name\nis Johnson. It's that Jones -- whoever pushed her; I\nforget -- but one guy --\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of the people pushed\nher, and she named that -- she named the other person. She\nmade a mistake about who pushed her. Can they have\nsubstitution in that case?\nMR. BENDURE: I would say yes, because --\nagain, assuming that all of the other criteria are\nsatisfied.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. The non-pusher\nhas notice --\nMR. BENDURE: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and everything else.\nBut there's no relationship between the two of them.\nMR. BENDURE: It's -- it's obviously a\nslightly different and more difficult case from our\nperspective, but what I think is critical is the status\nthat's involved. In this particular case, the suit was\nfiled against the vessel operator, and that vessel\noperator was identified as Costa Cruise, when we know\nthat the actual identity was Costa Crociere.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the first --\nwhen was your first notice of that? I mean, it was on\nthe first page of the ticket, but the answer came after\nthe statute of limitations. Was that your first notice\nthat there was this different entity, or did you know\nthat earlier?\nMR. BENDURE: It was -- we say that was the\nfirst notice. Now, the circuit court used an imputed\nknowledge rationale to suggest that the inclusion of the\nname \"Costa Crociere\" within the definitions section\ngave us what I would call constructive notice. But in\nterms of actual knowledge that -- that we had sued the\nwrong party, it was the answer which was filed after --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you don't -- I didn't\nunderstand you to deny that the ticket made it very\nclear who operated the ship.\nMR. BENDURE: I'm not sure --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you contest that?\nMR. BENDURE: I contest that it makes it\nvery clear, but I don't contest that one could conclude\nthat that provided constructive notice, that if read\ncarefully one might infer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why not? Don't you\nread the contract carefully before you bring a lawsuit?\nMR. BENDURE: Well, actually it was under\ndefinitions. And according to the definitions, Costa\nCrociere fell within the same definition of \"carrier\" as\nthe steward, the ship itself, any --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you are -- you either\nare contesting or you're not contesting that it's clear\nfrom the ticket. I had assumed it was clear from the\nticket.\nMR. BENDURE: I'm not -- I am not agreeing\nthat it's clear. I am agreeing that it provides\nconstructive notice from which one might infer that.\nNot clear, but discernible.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you had -- so then you\nhad notice even before the suit was filed. It was on\nthe -- it was on the ticket.\nMR. BENDURE: We had what the circuit court\nreferred to as \"imputed knowledge.\" Now, I think there's\na --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the -- did the name\nshow up any place other than page 1 of the general\nconditions of passage?\nMR. BENDURE: I don't believe so, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- and this is\nwhat? An 11-page, very small print --\nMR. BENDURE: It's an 11-page, small print\ndocument. And one thing that bears mention is that\nreference is under the designation \"Definitions,\"\nbecause Respondent makes some hay out of the fact that\nwe complied with other requirements which are under a\ndifferent heading which says \"Limitations of liability.\"\nBut what we also had was that we purchased\nthe ticket from Costa Cruise; it was sent by Costa\nCruise. We had the pre-suit notice sent to Costa\nCruise, responded by the -- the gentleman under the\nheading \"Costa\" that says \"claims administrator for\nCosta Cruise.\" So there was certainly what I would call\nconflicting information at best about which was the name\nof the actual vessel operator.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not if you read the\ndefinitions on page 1. And if you are not going to read\nall 11 pages before you file suit, I would think you\nwould at least read page 1. And that, it seems to me,\nmade it clear.\nMR. BENDURE: Well, it -- well, under the\nsame definition, the steward would be a carrier every\nbit as much as Costa Crociere, S.p.A. So it seems to me\nby that reasoning you could conclude that the steward or\nthe janitor is the vessel operator because they are\nlikewise defined as the carrier in that definitional\nsection.\nAnd, in fact, it also includes the vessel\nitself within the definition. So let's assume that my\nclient had, instead of suing Costa Cruise, sued Costa\nMagica, the name of the vessel itself. Most of the\ncases would say that an amendment like that to add the\nactual name, once you have identified the status of the\ndefendant you seek to sue, falls within the\nsubsection (ii), which is addressed primarily to the\nconstructive notice of the defendant, that they knew or\nshould have known that they would have been brought in\nthe suit but for a mistake concerning the proper party's\nidentity.\nBut the general focus of that second subsection,\nI think, is to look to whether this defendant knew or\nshould have known that it was the intended target.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me -- I've been\nthinking about the Chief Justice's question where the two\npeople are pushed and you don't know which person -- or\ntwo people fired the shotgun, and there's only one pellet,\nand you don't know which gun the pellet came from. In\nthat case, I think we could stipulate that even by\nreasonable inquiry, you wouldn't know.\nIn your case, I think the -- and I think the\ndifference in the case is that \"reasonable inquiry\"\nmeans you should have known. So now we have a rule that\nexcuses something you should have known but doesn't\nexcuse something you -- you couldn't have known, which\nseems odd. And because it's odd, therefore, maybe\nthat's why it only applies to clerical errors.\nMR. BENDURE: Well, actually when it talks\nof mistake, it seems to me that the very notion of\nmistake connotes error. I looked at a couple of\ndefinitions, dictionary definitions. Merriam Webster's\ndefines a mistake as, quote, \"a wrong judgment\" or,\nquote, \"a wrong action or statement proceeding from\nfaulty judgment, inadequate knowledge, or inattention.\"\nSo, at least in that colloquial sense, the very nature of\nmistake implies some measure of blameworthiness.\nAnd, indeed, it's hard to conceive of a\nmistake that couldn't be avoided. And I think that's\nthe problem with looking to the ticket, because what the\ndefinition on the ticket essentially says is: With due\ndiligence, you might have avoided the mistake.\nBut in my view, and I think in the view of\nthe language of the rule, that doesn't change the very\nnature of it as being a mistake.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --\nMR. BENDURE: Certainly.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- assume I accept\nyour argument, and I am the cruise operator -- the\ncruise owner, cruise ship owner, and I look at the\ncomplaint, and I say: I think they really meant me,\nbut -- I think. Now, within the 4(m) period, which is\nthe period in which I am supposed to reasonably know\nthat I would have been named absent a mistake, here an\nanswer is filed, and you are told there is a mistake,\nand you don't correct the mistake. What conclusion\nwould a reasonable person at that second juncture make\nabout whether you made a mistake or not?\nMR. BENDURE: I think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And I think that's what\nthe issue is here, which is, assuming the complaint\ncould be read as a mistake during the 4(m) period,\nwasn't that mistake corrected, and you refused or failed\nto act?\nMR. BENDURE: Let me respond both legally\nand factually. Legally, I submit that it doesn't make a\ndifference because under the text of the rule if during\nthat 4(m) period they had the knowledge that you're\nsuggesting and which would be suggested by the\nRespondent when they say, I think, if you had filed the\namended complaint and served it a month after the answer,\nit would have been timely, we would have done it.\nThat acknowledges that there was a mistake,\nand once there is a mistake, if during that 120-day\nperiod they knew or should have known that it would have\nbeen brought against them but for the mistake, that\nknowledge doesn't evaporate by later events, as long as\nthere is knowledge during that period.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That makes so little\nsense to me. Here I think -- and for the following\nreason: You seriously I don't think could contend that\nif you had sought to amend a year later, that that would\nhave been timely, correct?\nMR. BENDURE: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. But putting\naside prejudice --\nMR. BENDURE: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what the lower court\nsaid was because your delay speaks to a choice, that\nthat's the only thing a reasonable defendant would have\nassumed, that having been told that you sued the wrong\nparty and you continued in that action, that that's what\nyou intended to do, to sue that wrong party.\nMR. BENDURE: Let me point out factually --\nand I did not stress it in my brief. The answer was\nfiled on February 25th. Twenty-three days later, on\nMarch 20th, the court entered a scheduling order which\nsaid: You have until the end of June to amend your\ncomplaint to add parties.\nSo it seems to me that a defendant faced\nwith a court order that says the time for amendment\nextends till the end of June would not be drawing any\nconclusions that the plaintiff's state of mind had\nchanged. And one difficulty with trying to look at\ndifferent points during the 120-day period is that it\nseems to me you'd have a constantly moving target.\nIf you say that we satisfied 120(m) at one\npoint in time but somehow that's not enough and at a\nlater point in time maybe they didn't know it any more,\nand then perhaps I guess in theory you could have them\nagain -- if we had sent them a letter even after that and\nsaid, you know, we really did mean it, and then for some\nreason they concluded otherwise, you'd have a constantly\nmoving target. And that's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bendure, would you\nexplain one factual matter to me? I might have gotten\nthis wrong, but I thought the answer was filed after the\n1 year had run.\nMR. BENDURE: It had. It had.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So when the answer was\nfiled it was too late for you to come within the statute\nof limitations.\nMR. BENDURE: Absolutely true.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And I thought that would be\nthe answer that you would give to Justice Sotomayor,\nbecause when you got the answer -- which was filed after\nhow many days?\nMR. BENDURE: It was filed I think 24 days\nafter the complaint.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If you had gotten that a\nfew days earlier, you could have amended, and then we\nwouldn't be here.\nMR. BENDURE: That's certainly true, Your\nHonor. And I think it also --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You have\n120 days to amend, don't you, from the filing of the\ncomplaint?\nMR. BENDURE: No, Your Honor. The 120 days\nis the time frame for the notice to the defendant.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right.\nMR. BENDURE: It -- 120 days after the amended\ncomplaint is our time for service of the amended --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Complaint.\nMR. BENDURE: -- complaint on the new defendant.\nBut I think the point that is raised by Justice Ginsburg is\nthis: Once we find out and the limitation period has already\nexpired, school's out. If we tried to amend immediately\nthereafter -- if we hadn't made a mistake -- we couldn't\namend 1 day after expiration of the limitation period.\nSo if we had acted immediately, we still\ndon't get relation back unless we've satisfied the two\ncriteria of the subsections. But if we do satisfy those\nwithin the 120-day period, then we fall in the safe\nhaven provided by the rule whether the amendment itself\noccurs 1 week, 3 weeks, or 7 weeks afterwards. That --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the basic point is\nthe answer didn't come in until you were already out\nunder the statute of limitations.\nMR. BENDURE: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So from their point of\nview, nothing else matters; you were out when they filed\ntheir answer, and you could do nothing to cure that.\nMR. BENDURE: We could do nothing to, as a\nmatter of right, file within the limitation period.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did your amended complaint\ncontain any new and material allegations other than the\nname correction?\nMR. BENDURE: It actually was a second\ncount, but it was the same allegations against Costa\nCrociere that had been made against Costa Cruise. We\ndid not amend the theories of liability. And, again,\ngetting back to the question of status and theories, I\nthink that's the critical distinction between this case\nand the cases they rely upon, Ish Yerushalayim and\nthings like that, where you're changing from an\nindividual defendant to an institutional defendant or\nvice versa on a different theory. And, of course, you\ncouldn't mistake an individual for an institution.\nAnd that I think is the line of demarcation\nthat we're asking the Court to draw, and it explains\nwhy in the lower courts the decisions which present our\nparadigm all or virtually all allow relation back;\nwhereas, those that seek to amend a change from an\nindividual to a corporation or vice versa often don't\npermit relation back.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that the only\ncondition was that it had to arise out of the same event\nor transaction, which would give you much more running\nroom than -- than what you assert.\nMR. BENDURE: Only if you're amending\nagainst the same defendant. If you are adding a new\ndefendant, you have to satisfy (i) and (ii), which look\nto the notice and reason to know of the new defendant.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bendure, in addition\nto the mailing of the ticket -- the mailing of the\nticket came; it said \"Costa Cruise\" -- were there any\nother connections between the plaintiff passenger and\nCosta Cruise beyond the ticket coming in an envelope\nthat says \"Costa Cruise\"?\nMR. BENDURE: There was the -- the pre-suit\nclaims notice which was sent to Costa Cruise at the\nFlorida address, in attempted compliance with the\nprovision of the ticket which says you must file notice\nto the carrier before filing suit. And you have to do\nthat within 185 days.\nSo we not only got the ticket from Costa\nCruise -- we bought it from Costa Cruise -- the ticket\nitself, if you look at I think it's 25a of the\nappendix to the petition for certiorari, there is a\nprominent page which says \"Costa Cruise, cruise company\"\nnext to a picture of the vessel. So we have that.\nThen when we filed the notice, we sent it to\nCosta Cruise, we get a letter back from a person who\nclaims to be in a position to resolve the liability of\nthe vessel over -- owner, signed by him as claims\nadministrator for Costa Cruise.\nThose are the things -- oh, and then we\nhave, prior to the commencement of suit, the\nInternet investigation about which Florida company is\nregistered to do business in the State of Michigan, and\nwe look at the Costa Cruise Web site, which says: \"Costa\nCrociere with several offices in several countries,\nUnited States office, Costa Cruise, Florida.\"\nSo those are some of the things which give\nrise to the mistake --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bendure, can -- can I\ncome back to your -- I'm not sure why it matters, but it\nseems to me you're giving too narrow an interpretation,\nand I would not like our opinion to read any more\nnarrowly than the statute allows.\nIt seems to me that if you assert a\ndifferent claim arising out of the same transaction, you\nwould be able to amend. If you will look at (c)(1)(C),\nwhich is what you're asserting here, right? (C)(1)(C)\nsays, \"the amendment changes the party or the naming of\nparty against whom the claim is asserted, if Rule\n15(c)(1)(B) is satisfied.\" Then you go back to (1)(B)\nand it says, \"the amendment asserts a claim or defense\nthat arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence\nset out.\"\nIt doesn't say it has to be the same claim.\nMR. BENDURE: There's no question we\nsatisfy that. Everybody agrees.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. That's\nwhy I don't understand why you're arguing a more\nnarrow -- a more narrow interpretation.\nMR. BENDURE: Because I'm forced to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me you're home\nfree with (B).\nMR. BENDURE: Unfortunately, (C) then goes\non and says: \"And if, within the period provided,\" (i)\nand (ii). So --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, yes, but -- but those\nare the only things we -- we have to argue about.\nMR. BENDURE: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There's no doubt that you\nare asserting -- even if you were asserting a different\nclaim, it certainly arose out of the same transaction or\nevent, didn't it?\nMR. BENDURE: Certainly. No question about\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. BENDURE: If the Court doesn't have any\nadditional questions at this time, I'd like to reserve\nthe remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Glazier.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. GLAZIER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GLAZIER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThere are, we suggest, two issues before the\nCourt: The first is the legal question of whether a\nplaintiff's knowledge about the identity of the proper\nparty can preclude a finding that there was a mistake\nconcerning the identity of the proper party. That, we\nsuggest, is in some ways the easier issue, because there\nare -- there's abundant authority from the circuit\ncourts of appeal and from this Court in Nelson v. Adams\nUSA, where the Court said the rule requires a mistake.\nIn that case, there was no mistake.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Glazier --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's no mistake if you\nhappen to know it, if you happen to know who the right\nparty is?\nMR. GLAZIER: Correct. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ever?\nMR. GLAZIER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have you ever driven a car\nwhere your wife has said turn left and you've turned\nright?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Has that ever happened to\nyou?\nMR. GLAZIER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was there anything you\ndidn't know?\nMR. GLAZIER: What the facts are here, Your\nHonor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm asking about this\nquestion, my hypothetical.\nMR. GLAZIER: You know --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was there anything you\ndidn't know?\nMR. GLAZIER: There is nothing that you did\nnot know.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Correct. Did you do it by\nmistake? Yes, of course, you did. It's happened to\nevery human being. There are millions of instances in\nwhich people do things by mistake where, in fact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think your wife made a\nmistake. I don't think you made a mistake.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, my wife does not make\nmistakes.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GLAZIER: I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I make mistakes, and\nsometimes I make mistakes knowing all the facts, and so\ndo you and so does everybody else. So I never heard of\nthis thing that you can't make a mistake knowing all the\nfacts. But anyway, here we have a person who didn't\nknow all the facts. What the judge says is he should\nhave known all the facts.\nWhere in the record does he say he did know\nall the facts?\nMR. GLAZIER: Where -- in three different\ntimes the plaintiff was informed of the facts. But let\nme say on the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's a different matter.\nMy wife told me to turn left and I turned right, okay?\nBut I didn't take it in.\nMR. GLAZIER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that's a different\nmatter. Where does it say that he did know the facts as\nopposed to he should have known the facts?\nMR. GLAZIER: The circuit court refers --\ntalks about imputed knowledge. We disavow that. There\nwas no need for imputed knowledge in this case. What\nimputes knowledge is someone who does not have\nknowledge. Courts and lawyers make that up. If you\ndon't have knowledge --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I just want the citations\nto the page. I wasn't challenging you. I just wanted\nthe citations to the page --\nMR. GLAZIER: There are --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- where there's a finding\nthat, in fact, he knew that this company called \"Costa\nCruise\" in Italian is the same as the company called\n\"Costa Cruise\" in English? I take it \"Crociere\" means\n\"cruise.\"\nMR. GLAZIER: They are -- they're separate\ncorporations.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes. One is called\n\"Costa Cruise\" in Italian and one is called \"Costa\nCruise\" in English. And I just want to know where it\nsays in the record that the client or he, the lawyer,\nactually knew, actually knew that he should have sued\nthe one that spells its name in Italian?\nMR. GLAZIER: They are separate\ncorporations. There's nothing in the record that says --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't ask you that\nquestion. I'm asking for a record citation as to where\nthere is a finding that this particular plaintiff knew\nthat the Italian company called \"Costa Cruise\" was in\nfact the one he should have sued?\nMR. GLAZIER: There is a finding --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'll write them down and\nlook at them later.\nMR. GLAZIER: The finding on page 19a of the\ndistrict court opinion says --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 19a of the petition?\nMR. GLAZIER: 19a of the cert petition\nsays \"Her failure to timely naming Costa Crociere,\nS.p.A. as defendant.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought what the district\ncourt said was \"impute\" the knowledge.\nMR. GLAZIER: No. No, the district court\ndid not impute knowledge, and this is an important\npoint. The circuit court imputed knowledge, and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that?\nWhere does it say that on 19a?\nMR. GLAZIER: 19a -- it's not precisely it,\nbut it says, \"Her failure to timely named Costa Crociere\nas defendant was not the result of a mistake.\" It does not\nspecifically say --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I -- I know. I would\nsay in reading this, that both courts have made the most\nelementary mistake of the English language in thinking\nthat when a person doesn't know something but should\nhave known it, that that's inconsistent with a mistake.\nThat's the very definition of a mistake.\nMR. GLAZIER: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, all I want is some\ncitation from you that shows that isn't what they\nthought.\nMR. GLAZIER: Well, the best I can do is the\nconclusion that there is not a mistake. But I -- I need\nto --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's the conclusion,\nand when I read two sentences down, it said they may have\nhad constructive knowledge. The word \"constructive\" to\nme, when I hear I want to run out the door, because what\nthe word \"constructive\" to me means is not knowledge.\nMR. GLAZIER: I'd like to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry. I -- I am not\nfollowing it. Where -- where -- where --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm on page 19a.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. But he's talking\nabout constructive notice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Constructive notice.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- by -- by the defendant,\nnot constructive knowledge by the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then what is --\nwhere is the page that it says that the plaintiff had actual,\nas opposed to imputed, knowledge?\nMR. GLAZIER: The -- there -- there is not\nthat sentence --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. GLAZIER: -- in the opinion. What there\nis, is the plaintiff made a conscious choice.\nThe facts of the case are, first of all,\nbefore the lawsuit is filed the plaintiff has the\nticket. There is no doubt, no doubt whatsoever, that\nthe plaintiff or her attorney read --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any other than\nthat one page on the ticket, that against the mailing\nenvelopes that she got that say \"Costa Cruise\" -- is\nthere anything in the entire record other than that\ndefinition page that includes carrier, that includes\nsteward, anything else that tips her off that this is a\ndifferent corporation?\nMR. GLAZIER: There are three different\npieces of evidence. The first is the ticket. The\nticket defines carrier as Costa Crociere. It is the\nonly entity stated by name --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It says it includes\nstewards. What do you -- what do you say to that?\nMR. GLAZIER: I'm sorry. I didn't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It includes the stewards on\nthe boat, according to your -- your friend.\nMR. GLAZIER: It lists one entity by name,\nCosta Crociere, and lists others by role. Now, there\nmay be some dispute over whether --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why can't Costa\nCruise be perceived to hold one of those roles?\nMR. GLAZIER: Well, one might argue that\nthere might be a number of different entities that might\nbe a carrier, but there is only one entity which is\nclearly the carrier, indisputably a carrier.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the relationship\nbetween those corporations?\nMR. GLAZIER: Costa Crociere is, I believe,\none level removed an owner of Costa Cruise Lines. Costa\nCrociere operates around the world. They have different\ncompanies that operate as sales and marketing agents in\ndifferent regions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But are they -- are they\nsister corporations, a parent-sub --\nMR. GLAZIER: No.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- or what?\nMR. GLAZIER: Costa Crociere is parent, and I\nbelieve there's a corporation below them, and then that\ncorporation owns Costa Cruise Lines.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: When it's below them, you\nmean it owns all the shares in its -- in its subsidiary\ncompany?\nMR. GLAZIER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, the -- the\ndefinition of carrier includes independent contractors.\nI mean -- I -- I would -- other than that they are more\nclosely related, I can see someone thinking, well, Costa\nCruise is at least an independent contractor with which\nCosta Crociere does business.\nMR. GLAZIER: There might be more than one\ncarrier, but there is one carrier identified by name.\nIt is the first -- it is the first person listed. Costa\nCrociere is the carrier. I -- I suggest that if one\nreads the first page of the ticket, one might have\nquestions about whether there might be some other\nentities that are carriers, but there is simply no doubt\nthat Costa Crociere is the carrier.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And if you went to --\nMR. GLAZIER: Now, there is no --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If you went to the Web site,\nwhich was mentioned, for Costa Cruise, there would be a tab\nthat says \"Our ships\" \"Our ships\" -- and one of those ships\nis Costa Magica, whatever.\nMR. GLAZIER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: \"Our ships,\" and it\nidentifies Costa Cruise as the cruise operator. That's\nthe information that's given to passengers in the United\nStates who are going to book on these ships. It says\nCosta Cruise, our ships, Costa Cruise is the operator.\nThat's what was being put forth to the public.\nMR. GLAZIER: What -- what -- the relationship\nbetween the parties was governed by the ticket. The\nticket says, for example, the claim against the carrier\nhas to be filed within the Southern District of Florida.\nThis claim was filed in Southern District of Florida,\nbut they did not sue the carrier as identified on the\nticket. And the question is was there a mistake\nconcerning the identity of the proper party --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it shouldn't matter\nthat this confusion was caused in large part by this\nentity that advertises in English under the name \"Costa\nCruise\" and identifies Costa Cruise as the operator.\n\"The largest European cruise operator\" is how Costa\nCruise is -- is identified in -- in the advertising.\nMR. GLAZIER: We -- we believe that the\nticket is clear, and that governs. But even if one would\ndisagree with that, then we move forward. If there were\nany confusion, there's an answer filed. Costa Cruise\nLines is sued. Costa Cruise Lines denies that it can be\nheld liable, says it wasn't the carrier, it wasn't --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the answer is filed\nconveniently after the 1-year period has run.\nMR. GLAZIER: The answer is filed, but the\nquestion of whether the defendant knew or should have\nknown that there -- it -- it would have been sued but\nfor a mistake, the inquiry there is not within the\nlimitations period. It was until the 1991 amendment,\nwhich followed the Schiavone case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I don't --\nI mean, there's some sharp practice going on here.\nParagraph 10 of their complaint sues Costa Cruise Lines\nbecause -- saying they owned, operated, managed,\nsupervised, and controlled the ocean-going passenger\nvessel. And it's the same lawyer for Costa Cruise as\nfor Costa Crociere, right?\nMR. GLAZIER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So that\nlawyer looks at this and says: Aha, they made a\nmistake; they named the cruise line rather than the name\nin Italian. So I'm going to wait until the statute of\nlimitations runs, and then a couple of days after, I'm\ngoing to say aha.\nMR. GLAZIER: The statute of limitations is\nnot the measuring period. It was before the 1991\namendment. Now, what happened here is the answer is\nfiled, which makes clear the defendant -- the defendant\nCosta Cruise Lines denies it was involved with the\nownership, operation, or management. That's Joint\nAppendix 30. Joint Appendix --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the answer say the\nstatute -- the 1-year period has run? Was that raised\nas a defense in the answer?\nMR. GLAZIER: It was not raised in the -- in\nthe defense -- it was not raised as defense in the\nanswer. It -- it was not.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When was it raised as a\ndefense?\nMR. GLAZIER: It was raised 10 weeks later\nin a motion for summary judgment, which was still within\nthe Rule 4(m) period, and that is the crucial period.\nIf upon reading the answer, which says the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- the Rule 4(m)\nperiod concerns when you can serve. It doesn't say that\nthe statute of limitations is any more than what was the\nterm of the -- of the passage, was 1 year.\nMR. GLAZIER: Well, the Rule 4(m) period is\nawfully important because Rule 15(c) turns on, since\n1991, on the Rule(4)(m) period. If during the Rule 4(m)\nservice period, the -- it became clear to Costa Crociere\nthat it was an intended defendant, that it would have\nbeen sued but for a mistake, then the complaint against\nCosta Crociere would relate back, even though it was not\ntimely filed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, that -- that\nassumes -- that assumes -- when, what is it, 1(C)(ii),\n\"knew or should have known,\" it says within the period\nprovided by rule 4(m). Now, in the early part of that\nperiod, at -- at one point in the period you should have\nknown. And at another point, because the answer was\nfiled, you shouldn't have known.\nMR. GLAZIER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you're relying on the\nfact that they filed an answer which -- I'm sorry --\nthat -- that you filed an answer which made it very\nclear to them what the situation was. But was there any\npoint, any -- and all it takes I think is any point\nwithin that 4(m) period -- when you -- you knew or should\nhave known?\nMR. GLAZIER: The answer, we submit, is no.\nWhen they filed the complaint, the complaint indicated a\ncouple of things. First of all, they were suing Costa\nCruise Lines, but they had read -- the complaint made\nclear that they had read the ticket. They specifically\nrelied on the venue provision of the ticket. So we knew\nthat they had read the ticket, which clearly identifies\nCosta Crociere as being the carrier, yet they still --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where is the\ndefense -- I mean, the ticket says suit must be filed\nwithin 1 year of the date of any alleged injury. And\nwhere is the -- that defense stated? You said it comes\nup 10 weeks --\nMR. GLAZIER: In the motion for summary\njudgment, which -- which is not in the joint appendix.\nIt's docket entry 19. The affidavit which is -- was\nfiled with the motion for summary judgment is in the --\nthe Joint Appendix at Joint Appendix 33. And the\nmotion -- the answer made clear that Costa Crociere is\nthe carrier which could be liable, not Costa Cruise\nLines --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but --\nMR. GLAZIER: -- but there was no change.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- being realistic\nabout it, as I understand it you're relying entirely on\nthe condition, general conditions of passage in the\nticket, the fine print describing the term \"carrier.\"\nThat's -- but do you take into account that\nthe cover of the ticket, which is what the passenger\nwould look at, uses \"Costa Cruises,\" blah, blah, blah --\n\"Costa Cruise Lines\" and so -- and doesn't even mention\nthe carrier?\nMR. GLAZIER: The --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Don't you think, looking\nat that ticket, if you were a passenger you would think\nyou were doing business with Costa Cruise?\nMR. GLAZIER: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Just looking at the cover?\nMR. GLAZIER: If what --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct that on the\ncover of the ticket, the Italian name isn't used at all?\nMR. GLAZIER: On the cover, the Italian name\nis not used. The ticketing agent's name --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And isn't that what the --\nMR. GLAZIER: -- is Costa Cruise Lines.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- what the passenger would\nnormally look at, understand who he is doing business with?\nMR. GLAZIER: If one were to not read the\nticket, which on page 1 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Assuming -- assuming the\nlawyer would just look at the cover before he files a\nlawsuit?\nMR. GLAZIER: We know -- if this were a\nquestion of uncertainty whether the lawyer read the\nticket, that would be one thing, but we know that the\nlawyer read the ticket.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't understand\nwhat the lawyer reading the ticket has to do with this\nquestion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because the question is\nwhether the lawyer made a mistake. Isn't that the\nquestion?\nMR. GLAZIER: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And he did make a mistake.\nMR. GLAZIER: The principle is if one knows\nwhat the true facts are -- if one knows what the true\nfacts are and proceeds in any event, then there's no\nmistake concerning the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That isn't true, is it? In\nthe English language, it's not true? I mean, that's why\nI was giving you some examples. I don't know; maybe\nthere's some special legal language somewhere written\nin Blackstone, or maybe it's Lord Coke, I don't know,\nthat says when you use the word \"mistake\" don't use it\nin English, use -- use it in Italian.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I mean, if we're going\nto use it in English, there -- it's not hard to find\ninstances where a person would know, but he'd still make\na mistake.\nMR. GLAZIER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And there's even a\nfortiori --\nMR. GLAZIER: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- if he doesn't know, even\nif he should.\nMR. GLAZIER: We have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Isn't that true?\nMR. GLAZIER: What we have up front is\nthe -- the ticket. If we move past that, it's sort of a\ntest case. All right, did this plaintiff really not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What possible reason is\nthere that somebody who is hurt on a ship and has a\nlawyer, and she has a broken leg, and she'd like to get\nrecovery, would deliberately sue the wrong person?\nMR. GLAZIER: The plaintiff --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there such a reason?\nMR. GLAZIER: The evidence in the record is\nthat the plaintiff's lawyer looked at the Web site and\nchose a United States corporation instead of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I'm just saying, did he\ndo it by mistake? If you were representing this person,\nwould you want to sue the company that could give you\nsome money if they are liable? Or would you rather sue\nthe Bank of America that has nothing to do with it?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GLAZIER: Well, if it were -- if I had\nto sue Costa Crociere through the Hague Convention in\nGenoa, maybe a lawyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I want to ask you\nabout that, because in your brief you refer in your\nfootnote on page 6 to requirements of the Federal\nGovernment 44101-44103. So I looked those up. I\ndiscovered that 44103 says that it is a requirement, and\nyou say you follow these requirements, that you shall\nestablish under regulations of the FMC financial\nresponsibility.\nAnd those regulations tell you that, at\nleast as best I could read them, that you must furnish a\nwritten designation of a person in the United States as\na legal agent for service of process, and they are\nreferring to instances in which somebody on a ship\nsuffered an accident.\nSo since you say that you are complying with\nthat, I would like to know the name and address of that\nperson in the United States for whom you must send legal\nprocess, because if obviously that had been on the\nticket, that is precisely the man to whom this plaintiff\nwould have sent the notice.\nMR. GLAZIER: I cannot answer the question\nnow.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well then, were you correct\nwhen you said in your -- in your brief that this company\nwhich you represent does comply with 44103?\nMR. GLAZIER: My understanding is the answer\nis yes, but I cannot address the specific question.\nI submit --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is relevant, I think,\nbecause it adds to the confusion if they are under a\nlegal requirement to have a service -- an agent to\nreceive service, and then they not only don't do it, but\nthey don't have it printed on the ticket. And they get\neverybody mixed up by having the same name in English,\nor a very similar one, and announcing someone you're\nsupposed to serve, and then it turns out to be not that\nperson you're supposed to serve. It's a mysterious\nperson that you can't find.\nMR. GLAZIER: But the question, though --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It seems odd. I'd like\nto know what the explanation is of this.\nMR. GLAZIER: Well, the question is not a\nmore generalized blame explanation, but under the rule,\nthe language of the rule, whether Costa Crociere knew or\nshould have known that the action would have been\nbrought against it but for a mistake concerning the\nproper party's identity.\nAnd the most problematic case -- part of the\ncase for the plaintiff is why, when they were told in\nthe answer that they had not sued the proper party, that\nCosta Cruise Lines was not the carrier, was not the\noperator, but Costa Crociere is, why did the plaintiff\nnot do anything?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we -- let's clarify\nthat point now. I am looking at 3a, which is the court\nof appeals opinion, and it says that \"Costa Crociere\nmoved to dismiss, arguing that it had been sued after\nthe 1-year ticket period allowed for claims set\nforth\" -- as set forth in the ticket. Then the rule\ntells us that you have this much time to serve, and\nthen the complaint will -- the -- the amendment will\nrelate back to the date of the original filing.\nIt doesn't change your statement, your\ndefense. The 1-year statute of limitations isn't\naffected. What is affected is the complaint will\nrelate back if there's an amendment filed. But the\n1-year statute of limitations remains, and you didn't\nbother to answer until the -- that time had run.\nMR. GLAZIER: But if -- if, during the\n120-day period -- you know, the Rule 15(c) happens to\nrely upon the measuring point, but service is not the crucial\npoint. Within that 120-day period, if the plaintiff had\ndone anything, anything at all, to indicate that she had\nnot sued Costa Crociere because of a mistake, then the\ncomplaint would have related back, a very easy case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but the relation\nback is different from the point at which the statute\nhas run. The statute runs after 1 year. Then, if she\ndoes what the rules say, it can relate back to the date\nof the original filing. The fact remains that you\ndidn't file your answer until after the limitation\nperiod had run.\nMR. GLAZIER: Yes. Yes, we did not file the\nanswer. They filed the lawsuit on the eve of the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why does that even matter?\nI'm not really sure I'm following this argument. Let's\nsay that the answer was filed during the limitations\nperiod, and the lawyer -- the plaintiff's lawyer is a\nsolo practitioner, and he or she is out of the office\nbecause the lawyer's on a cruise --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- and doesn't come back\nfor 2 weeks. And by that time, the limitations period\nhas run. It's still a mistake.\nMR. GLAZIER: If --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where do you see in --\nthe question on which cert was granted has to do with\nimputed knowledge. Where do you see in the text of this\nrule anything that picks up the concept of either imputed\nknowledge or actual knowledge? It just talks about a mistake.\nMR. GLAZIER: We do not rely at all upon\nimputed knowledge. The Court granted review, but we\ndon't think there is imputed knowledge here.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, where -- just -- where do\nyou -- where in the rule is there anything that relates to the\nreasonableness of the mistake? What if it is the most\nfoolish, negligent mistake you can possibly imagine? Is\nit not still a mistake?\nMR. GLAZIER: The rule contemplates by its\nstructure that the mistake will be the cause of the\nreason why the -- the plaintiff did not sue the parties.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not what the\nrule says. That's not what the rule says. The rule\ndoesn't talk about what kind of mistake or why. The\nrule says what the defendant should have known. And so,\nwhen you read this complaint, it's very clear you know\nyou're the carrier.\nMR. GLAZIER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You know cruise -- the\nother line, the sales agent, can't be the carrier,\ncorrect?\nMR. GLAZIER: We --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's either a factual\nor a legal mistake. There is no other way to read that\nother than that there is a mistake.\nMR. GLAZIER: And then --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because -- then have you\nto answer Justice Breyer's question, which is: What\nconceivable reason that is not either negligence or\nunintentional or inadvertent or just plain stupidity,\nhowever you want to define it, that someone who is\ninjured would want to name a party who wasn't\nresponsible for the injury?\nMR. GLAZIER: The most powerful evidence is\nsimply when they were informed of the claimed mistake,\nthey did nothing for 95 days to indicate in any manner\nwhatsoever that it was a mistake. They had --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's evidence from\nwhich the absence of a mistake might be inferred. I\nagree with that, but that doesn't establish that it\nwasn't -- it wasn't a mistake.\nMR. GLAZIER: Well, this -- whether\nsomething is a mistake ultimately is a factual issue.\nThere's a legal question of whether a plaintiff's\nknowledge of the identity of a proper party can preclude\na finding of mistake. But once we get past that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But, counsel, don't --\nwhat you're really talking about is whether once the\nanswer was filed, they were dilatory in making their\nmotion. I don't understand how you can argue that the\nday you received this complaint, you didn't understand\nthat some sort of mistake had been made.\nThe day that the answer came in, you might\nstart to have a doubt because of their delay in the\nmotion to amend, but doesn't that go to a 15(a)\nquestion, whether the judge should have given leave to\namend because of dilatory tactics? Isn't that a 15(a)\nquestion, not a 15(c) question?\nMR. GLAZIER: Well, delay in moving to amend\nvia 15(a). But 15(c) requires the judge to determine\nwhether there was a mistake. And here, in essence, we\nhave a test case: Well, the plaintiff is claiming that\nthe reason why she did not sue Costa Crociere --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there anything in the\nface of the complaint that would suggest anything but a\nmistake? Now, forget -- I'm being very specific. On\nthe face of the complaint. You read that.\nMR. GLAZIER: Yes, I believe there is. The\ncomplaint specifically makes clear that the plaintiff's\nlawyer read the ticket.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where does it say that?\nWhere does it say: \"I know that the carrier is Costa\nCrociere\"? Where does it say that?\nMR. GLAZIER: The complaint certainly does\nnot say that. What --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What the complaint says\nis that Costa Cruise, the operator of the vessel,\ninjured me, correct?\nMR. GLAZIER: It says that the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And is that an accurate\nstatement of fact?\nMR. GLAZIER: That -- it's not an accurate\nstatement of fact.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I would have\nsaid the previous paragraph, 9, says: \"The plaintiff\nhas complied with all the pre-suit requirements of the\npassenger ticket.\" So you know they read the ticket.\nMR. GLAZIER: Right. And in the paragraph\nbefore, venue is proper in Broward County; defendant's\npassenger ticket contains a forum selection. So we know\nwhen Costa -- Costa Cruise Lines, or Costa\nCrociere learns of this, we know that the plaintiff\ndecided --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, which is it?\nIs that a Freudian slip?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GLAZIER: No. No, because we're --\nbecause we're not disputing --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just a mistake.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GLAZIER: We're not -- we are not\ndisputing the notice issue. What -- what is clear is\nthey have read the ticket, and despite that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Despite that, they made a\nmistake.\nMR. GLAZIER: -- they have decided to sue\nCosta Cruise Lines.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They made a mistake,\nright? They read the ticket, and despite that, they\nmade a mistake.\nMR. GLAZIER: No.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What?\nMR. GLAZIER: We don't think so.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why isn't -- why doesn't\nthe rule cover it?\nMR. GLAZIER: But, again, if we move past --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I object to your relying\nupon the -- the answer as -- as establishing compliance\nwith (C)(ii), because (C), in the prologue, says \"is\nsatisfied, if within the period provided by Rule 4(m).\"\nAnd there is at least some point within that\nperiod before the answer was filed. And if, within that\nperiod before the answer, you knew or should have known\nthat it was a mistake, it seems to me you lose.\nDo you understand what I'm saying?\nMR. GLAZIER: I understand what you're\nsaying, but there's nothing in -- just the point --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the -- the only\nthing you could rely on for that short period before the\nanswer is filed is simply the ticket, right?\nMR. GLAZIER: There's nothing in the rule --\nthe ticket and the complaint -- there's nothing in the\nrule that says that only events up to point of the\nrunning of the limitations period or the service of the\nanswer are relevant. It is throughout the certain --\nwithin the period --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you are reading\n\"within the period\" to mean \"throughout the period.\" It\ndoesn't say \"throughout the period.\" It says \"if within\nthe period.\"\nMR. GLAZIER: Well, the district court,\nwhich is serving as the fact-finder there, looked at all\nthe evidence. And the powerful evidence is the service\nof the answer, which identifies the party --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's an important\nissue with respect to the statute. I don't think we can\ntreat cavalierly whether \"within the period\" means\n\"throughout the period.\" That's one of the issues here.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one -- one question\nabout the face of the ticket, the one with the picture\non it. Is it Costa Cruise or Costa Crociere that got\nthis big award for \"B.E.S.T. 4\"?\nMR. GLAZIER: I -- I don't know the answer\nto that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Pardon me.\nMR. GLAZIER: I don't know the answer at\nthis time.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I make the assumption that\nit's the cruise line, Crociere, that got the award. So\nthe ticket itself confuses the two companies.\nIs that a mistake, incidentally?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If I am right, is that a mistake?\nMR. GLAZIER: I -- Your Honor -- clearly, as\nyou said, Costa Crociere is the vessel operator. The\nticket makes it clear on the next page, the very next\npage --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How many -- if you have a\n1,000-page ticket, how many pages do you have to read?\nMR. GLAZIER: Here, you only have to read\none.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But this is the first one.\nMR. GLAZIER: Well, this is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The one I pointed out to\nyou with the mistake, that's the first one.\nMR. GLAZIER: It's -- it's on the cover.\nThe ticketing agent here, Costa Cruise Lines, adds the\ncover. The first page of the provisions say Costa\nCrociere is the -- is the vessel operator.\nBut, again, if one looks at the answer,\nthere's no response. No response, and then a motion for\nsummary judgment. Still nothing. If the plaintiff had\nmerely said in an e-mail or a phone call, hey, I made a\nmistake, then it would be clear. An easy case. But\nthey did not act despite being informed. Despite being\ninformed in the answer of the identity of the proper\nparty and in the motion for summary judgment. The trial\ncourt, serving as the trier of fact here on this issue,\nhad to make that decision. Maybe the court with another --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm still puzzled, because\nRule (C) just requires -- describes the state of mind of\nthe defendant, correct? C(i) and (ii); isn't that\nright?\nMR. GLAZIER: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And is it not true that\nunder (i), the defendant did receive such notice of the\naction, would not be prejudiced? That's clear, isn't it?\nMR. GLAZIER: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And is it also true that\nat the time they received the complaint, they knew or\nshould have known that the action would have been\nbrought against the carrier instead of the broker?\nMR. GLAZIER: The answer --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I just don't understand\nhow you get around the plain language.\nMR. GLAZIER: Our answer is no, and\nespecially considering, within the events, they don't\nshow that there's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You don't think -- you\ndon't think that the agent didn't realize that they\nwould have sued the carrier if they had known the\nidentity of the right party?\nMR. GLAZIER: What is known is that they had\nthe ticket. They still decided --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand all that.\nMR. GLAZIER: -- to sue Costa Cruise Lines --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But we're talking about the\n-- about mindset of the defendant, and to say that they\nwouldn't have sued -- they would have sued the broker\ninstead of this carrier? It's absurd.\nMR. GLAZIER: Well, the events played a role and\ndemonstrated that even after the plaintiff was informed\nof the identity of the proper party, they continued to\npursue the claim against the ticketing agent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Bendure, you have 9 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. BENDURE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BENDURE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nObviously, from the questions, the Court has\na good grasp of the facts and the issues in our\narguments. I'd just like to clarify a couple of\nfactual points.\nThe district court ruling didn't rely on the\nticket at all. What the district court said was: I\nadopt the legal premise that if you knew before the\nfiling of -- before the running of the statute of\nlimitations but didn't sue, that would not be a\nmistake. And here, says the district court judge, they\nfiled their answer after the statute of limitations, and\nthat's why you lose under a rule that requires that\nnotice before the statute of limitations expires. That\nwas the district court rationale.\nThe circuit court was the one who relied\nupon the imputed knowledge notion that is now, I think,\ndisavowed by Respondent himself.\nWith regard to the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is sort of an\nequitable rule, isn't it, this mistake? We're going to,\nyou know -- equity takes account of such things. It\nseems to me very reasonable to say: If the mistake is\negregious, it doesn't apply.\nMR. BENDURE: I think now one gets into a\nwonderful process of trying to identify mistakes on a\nscale of egregiousness. Like, how many points of\negregiousness would it take? And I think that's beyond\nthe statute, or the court rule itself, which just uses\nthe plain language \"mistake.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought\nyour answer would have been: This has nothing to do\nwith equity at all. It's just the interpretation of a\nlegal rule.\nMR. BENDURE: Certainly. And the rule\nitself -- I understood Justice Scalia's point to be that\nthe interpretation of the rule is designed to be liberal\nin its application to avoid the forfeiture of\npotentially meritorious causes of action over technical\nmistakes which have nothing to do with the merits. I\nthought that was the sense in which you used the word\n\"equitable.\"\nThe other point I'd like to make, even\nthough it's, in my view, legally insignificant, is their\nargument regarding the nature of the delay. Their\nmotion for summary judgment was filed on May 6th. Two\ndays later, the court erroneously dismissed the lawsuit\nfor a period of approximately a month. It was then\nreinstated on June 5th, and our response, which sought\nrelation back, was filed on June 13th.\nSo in addition to the scheduling order,\nthere is a 1-month period of time in which the case was\nerroneously dismissed. So if it were significant, we\ncould say there's not significant delay. But the\nultimate point is it's legally beside the point.\nIf the Court has no further questions,\nI'll --\nJUSTICE BREYER: This might be tangential,\nbut is there a reason to suggest the Federal Maritime\nCommission look into this? Because I read the regs. I\ndon't understand quite what's going on, because it seems\nto me they have a rule that is designed to prevent this\nsituation.\nMR.
