        "content": "(11:04 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We'll now hear argument in\nJohnson against the United States.\nMr. Reichman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF COURTLAND REICHMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. REICHMAN: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nOn occasion a prior conviction that's used to\nenhance a Federal sentence turns out to have been obtained\nin violation of the Constitution. This Court addressed\nthe procedure for handling those challenges in Custis and\nDaniels. Those cases determined that, in most\ncircumstances, the facts that would show the prior\nconviction is unconstitutional do not support a claim\neither at sentencing or under section 2255.\nThis is the key phrase in this case: facts\nsupporting the claim. It's the key part of the fourth\ntrigger in the 2255 statute of limitations. In this case,\nthe State court vacatur is the fact supporting the claim\nfor three reasons.\nFirst, as expressed, Daniels made clear that the\nunderlying facts, those facts that you use for the\nchallenge to the prior conviction, do not support a claim\nunder 2255, leaving the vacatur as the operative fact.\nSecond, the plain meaning of the word fact\nencompasses a vacatur just like courts often refer to\nconvictions as historical facts.\nAnd third, there's no reason to dispense with\nthe plain language of the statute to serve policy ends.\nThe policies animating both AEDPA and section 2255 are\nserved by the rule advanced by petitioner. And moreover,\npetitioner's rule will be a lot more straightforward in\napplication.\nLet me -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: One little complication here.\nUnder 2255, even if that applies in this situation, it\ndoes establish a 1-year statute of limitations. Right?\nMR. REICHMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And subsection (4) of that\nsection says: the date on which the facts supporting the\nclaim or claims presented could have been discovered\nthrough the exercise of due diligence. Now, is that a\nrequirement that the defendant seek State relief on a\ntimely basis? Can the defendant just wait indefinitely\nbefore going back to the State and seeking a vacatur? Or\ndoes that due diligence requirement apply to the efforts\nto get State action?\nMR. REICHMAN: Well, there -- there are several\nlevels to the response. Let me work through them.\nThe first is that the petitioner's position\nrelies on a straightforward reading of the statute, and we\nthink that the due diligence requirement is satisfied when\nthe vacatur is discovered through the exercise of due\ndiligence.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but you're not being\nresponsive to my question. Here the defendant did go back\nto the State courts and got this -- the earlier\nconvictions vacated. Right?\nMR. REICHMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But I asked you, is there any\nrequirement that the defendant act promptly in going back\nto the State to get the vacaturs?\nMR. REICHMAN: There's no requirement in -- in\nthe fourth trigger. However -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, except that the statute\nitself speaks of diligence.\nNow, can the -- suppose he's been given a very\nlong Federal sentence and part of that is the result of\nprior State convictions. And suppose he waits 10 years\nbefore going back to the State to seek to overturn those\nearlier State convictions. Is there no requirement that\nhe act promptly?\nMR. REICHMAN: The requirement is not found in\nthe fourth trigger. The requirement is found in the State\nstatutes of limitations. And to elaborate on the\nfootnotes in our brief, we have found that there are\napproximately -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but the Federal statute\nsays -- it puts a burden of diligence on the defendant.\nMR. REICHMAN: Reading the plain language, we\nthink that burden of diligence applies to discovering the\nvacatur. If you -- if a vacatur is a fact -- and I think\nthe Government has all but -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How -- how could one not\ndiscover the vacatur?\nHere's my problem. I -- I frankly don't think\nthe text of -- of (4), part (4), really fits comfortably\nwith either your interpretation or the Government's. It\nsays the date on which the facts supporting the claim\ncould have been discovered through the exercise of\ndiligence.\nWell, as you point out in your brief, the fact\nsupporting the claim here is simply the elimination of the\nprior conviction, the vacatur of the prior conviction.\nThat's the fact supporting the claim, not the facts which\nled to the vacatur, but it's the vacatur. So that makes\nthe Government's case a little uncomfortable.\nBut it seems to me you have to acknowledge that\nyour case is pretty uncomfortable when you -- when you\ntalk about discovering the fact of the -- of the vacatur.\nI mean, it's a matter of public record. How does one\ndiscover a -- a public record? How -- how could you need\ndue diligence to discover a public record? I mean, it\nseems to me it's -- it's automatically -- isn't the\nvacatur always served on the -- on the person whose\nconviction is vacated? Isn't it always that person who\nseeks the vacation? So what sense does it make to talk\nabout his discovering that particular fact? It seems to\nme it makes no sense.\nSo you're left with -- with two competing\ninterpretations, both of which have some textual problems.\nI'm inclined to think you take the one that makes sense,\ngiven the purpose of the statute, and the purpose of the\nstatute, as Justice O'Connor has suggested, is to make\npeople bring up their claims promptly. And -- and that\npurpose would -- would be served by the Government's rule\nand not by yours. You say unless the State has some\nstatute of limitation, this -- this Federal requirement of\ndue diligence goes begging.\nWhat's -- what's your response to that? You\nreally think -- especially about the discover.\nMR. REICHMAN: I do and here's why, first,\nstarting with the language before I turn to the policy\nside of your question.\nOn the language, paragraph (4), the fourth\ntrigger, is broad language that was meant to cover a\nvariety of circumstances, things from ineffective\nassistance of counsel, to Brady violations, to vacaturs.\nI'll grant you that if Congress only intended the vacatur\nsituation to be covered by paragraph (4), we might wonder\nwhy they chose those particular words, but we know they\ndidn't intend this one circumstance.\nI think the Government's position as to discover\nboils down to this. Because the answer to the question,\nwhen could the vacatur have been discovered through\nreasonable diligence, is easy, the answer must be wrong.\nAnd we don't believe that to be the case. We think that\nyou can easily ask when could the vacatur have been\ndiscovered through the exercise of reasonable -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And when it could have been\ndiscovered I guess if he had taken due diligence and gone\nand made the motion within a year, at least, of his having\nbeen convicted in the Federal court.\nI mean, I don't see how you can have it both\nways. You want us to read that phrase very broadly to\ninclude under the word facts something like a vacatur, and\nthen it sounds to me you're being very literal and\nlinguistic when you say that due diligence to find the\nfacts shouldn't mean what I would take it as ordinarily\nmeaning, that -- that you have to, when you had a chance,\ngo back and generate this fact.\nMR. REICHMAN: I -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't see how you can do\nboth, in other words.\nMR. REICHMAN: I think we can. I think both the\ninterpretations of each of those contested words are\nstrict interpretations right within the plain meaning.\nAnd our case can boil down to asking whether there's\nsomething wrong with my English language when I say, on\nwhat day could the vacatur have been discovered through\nthe exercise of due diligence. It's -\nJUSTICE BREYER: On the pure English language,\nit's not exactly a fact.\nMR. REICHMAN: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it's a legal\ndetermination. We usually separate law from fact.\nMR. REICHMAN: And -- and as we point out in our\nbrief, there's nothing -- in this context in particular, a\nvacatur is like a conviction. It's a fact, you know, that\nis -- is commonly referred to by the court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, just so that I understand\nyour argument then, going back to Justice O'Connor's\nquestion, if you get a long sentence, can you sit there\nfor 10 years, then initiate the process to get the earlier\nconviction vacated and then say, as soon as it is, with\ndue diligence I'm here at the courthouse because, although\nI waited 10 years, I have brought my 2255 as soon as I\nlearned that my earlier sentence had been vacated? Your\nanswer to that question, I take it, is yes, he satisfies\nthe statute.\nMR. REICHMAN: He satisfies the statute, but I\nneed to point out something that I think is critical to\nunderstanding this question. At the end of the day, we're\ntalking about at most six States where this might be at\nissue. The rest of them either have laches or statutes of\nlimitations. And these are small States. We're talking\nabout a rule -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but in -- in six States,\nI would have thought that, A, the due diligence language,\ntogether with the general obvious policy of AEDPA, to get\nthis over with, would have made it very difficult to\nconclude that he can sit there without doing anything for\n10 years.\nMR. REICHMAN: Well, I -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe it's only in six States,\nbut six States count.\nMR. REICHMAN: They do count. But it ties into\nthe response -- the second part of Justice Scalia's\nquestion is, isn't finality served? Isn't that what AEDPA\nis all about? We don't believe that the Government's rule\nthat they propose will serve finality in the vast majority\nof cases because in the vast majority of cases, you're\ntalking about claims that will have no merit in State\ncourt. But because it's very difficult to complete the\nState court habeas process before the 1 year in the first\nparagraph, these petitioners will file placeholder\npetitions in Federal court and have them held while they\nfinish their State court review. So what you're doing is\nyou're talking about these six States, maybe 10 guys a\nyear, you're going to cause, as the Brackett court on\nremand said, thousands of placeholder petitions to be\nfiled, and you're needlessly extending all of those cases\nso that you cut off the rights for maybe 10 people who\nhappen to be in these States.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Here's -- here's a\nsimple way of looking at it. The minute that you're\nconvicted and you are subject to the enhanced sentence\nbased on a prior conviction, the obligation of due\ndiligence begins. You can't sit there for 10 years.\nThat's the point at which you've got to file your petition\nso that you can come into court with reasonable\npromptness, if not by the sentencing hearing itself, as\nsoon afterwards as the State process allows you.\nThat would be a simple due diligence point. It\nwouldn't involve placeholder petitions, and it would get\nthings concluded with reasonable promptness. Why isn't\nthat a way of -- of applying the statute?\nMR. REICHMAN: Because if you were going to be\nstrict about it -- and -- and I'm not sure I understand\nall of the parameters of the hypothetical -- in -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Easy. The minute he's\nconvicted, the State has charged him and -- and -- or his\n-- by some charging document has made clear that there is\ngoing to be an invocation of a prior conviction for an\nenhanced sentence. As soon as he is convicted of the\nlater offense in which that sentencing possibility has\nbeen raised, he has an obligation to go into the State\ncourt and start the process of -- of getting his earlier\nconviction vacated. Easy.\nMR. REICHMAN: If Mr. Johnson had done that in\nthis case, he still would have missed the 1-year statute\nof limitations. If Mr. Gadsen had done that in the Fourth\nCircuit case by Judge Wilkinson, he still would have\nmissed the 1-year statute of limitations.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But he would have acted with\ndue diligence and he would have had as -- I suppose, a\nvery powerful argument, which -- which the Government\napparently would accept, for -- for tolling.\nMR. REICHMAN: For equitable tolling? Well, I\ndon't know that the Government would accept equitable\ntolling.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, as I understood Justice\nSouter's question, it is the alternate that the Government\nsaid. The Government puts forward two arguments, and its\nalternate argument sounds to me just like what Justice\nSouter put to you, that is, he has to move diligently to\nchallenge those underlying convictions, that he cannot\nchallenge in Federal court because of -- was it -- Curtis\nand Daniels.\nWhy isn't that an -- an accommodation of what we\nknow was the concern of the Federal court -- of the -- of\nthe Congress that people act diligently? It happens that\n2255 wasn't framed with Curtis and Daniels in mind. There\nisn't any indication that the drafters of 2255 were aware\nof this peculiar situation where you can't make the\nchallenge in Federal court, you must go back to the State\nforum. But we do know they were concerned with diligence.\nMR. REICHMAN: Well, AEDPA was enacted after\nCustis was decided and I think we presume that the\nCongress was aware of the precedent, but the -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, wasn't -- didn't Mr.\nJohnson here wait a couple of years after the Federal\nsentencing before he tried to go back to the State courts?\nMR. REICHMAN: Yes, he did.\nThe -- the -- our answer -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I'm not sure that was a\ndiligent sort of a -- an effort.\nMR. REICHMAN: We believe it was diligent within\nthe -- the fourth trigger because, again, we rely on the\nplain language. And the -- the fall-back position, to\naddress your question and Justice Souter's question, is\nthat we don't believe -- we believe this is engrafting a\nwhole different statutory scheme on top of the one that we\nhave. The fall-back position of the Government is to say,\nall right, let's interpret the statute or rewrite it to\nsay that we're going to trigger the date on when the\nvacatur could have been obtained, not when it could have\nbeen discovered. And to do that, what they're saying is,\nwell, let's give him a year from the time of the Federal\nsentencing. So -- or -- or maybe even earlier, dating\nback to the time of the original conviction in State\ncourt. So they add that 1-year statute of limitations.\nThen they say then we'll add a provision that tolls during\nthe pendency of State habeas, and then we'll add another\n1-year statute of limitations on top of that after the\nvacatur is obtained. So we end up with -- instead of the\nplain language, we have two 1-year statutes of limitations\nwith a tolling provision in between, the type of tolling\nprovision that is, by the way, in section 2244.\nWe believe that petitioner's interpretation,\nalthough the answer is not difficult, it -- it is the\ncorrect answer. On what date did the -- could the vacatur\nhave been discovered through the exercise of due\ndiligence? And the answer I think was -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you -- you have to\nconcede that you are watering down almost to nothing any\ndue diligence requirement because on your reading of the\nstatute, there isn't -- there isn't any such requirement.\nMR. REICHMAN: Well, we think that that is -\nI'll -- I'll say that there's no -- we don't believe that\nthere is a requirement in the Federal statute, in\nagreement with -- with your statement, to exercise\ndiligence and seeking the vacatur. But we believe that\nthat is a necessary consequence of the administrative\ndecision that this Court made in Custis and Daniels to\nsend these back to the State court.\nIt -- it could have been the case that these\nwere all challenged at sentencing, and in fact, I think\nthat was the prevailing practice before Custis, that they\nwere challenged at sentencing. But Custis and then\nfollowed on by Daniels made a different decision, and I\nthink a good one. It made the decision to wrap these\nchallenges back to the State and that inevitably will\nresult in delays as it works it way through the State.\nThe rationale for the Court's decision makes\nperfect sense when you apply it to this context. One of\nthe key concerns, it seems to me, that the Court had was\nthat if you allow these Federal challenges that are\noutside the State statute of limitations, then it's very\npossible the State is not going to have the records\nnecessary to defend it because they wouldn't be expected\nto keep records outside of their statute of limitations.\nAnd that's simply not the case here because\nthese challenges, under the petitioner's rule, would be\nwithin the State statutes of limitations, and as this\nCourt recognized in Daniels, the States have a powerful\ninterest in defending their convictions and that powerful\ninterest, it seems to me, would lead them to preserve the\nrecords necessary to maintain their convictions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you make the argument or is\nit implicit in your argument -- maybe you don't have this\nconcern -- that if you imply a Federal due diligence\nstandard on your duty to vacate the State conviction, that\nit's just too burdensome on the petitioner who has to\nbegin fighting the vacatur battle at the same time that he\nhas only 1 year to complete his habeas with reference to\nthe other challenges to his conviction?\nMR. REICHMAN: That is not something that we've\nargued in the briefs. It -- it, no doubt, is true\nespecially when you're talking about a pro se petitioner.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask? You mentioned -- I\njust want to be sure I understand your point -- that there\nare only six States that are really affected by this rule.\nIs that because all the other States have State\nlimitations periods that require the prisoner to act\npromptly?\nMR. REICHMAN: Limitations period by statute or\nthey have a laches principle that would limit the ability.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So that the -- the\nhypothetical of the prisoner waiting 10 years to challenge\nthe State conviction can only arise in a few States. Is\nthat right?\nMR. REICHMAN: That's right, and from what I can\ntell from the Department of Justice statistics, there are\neven fewer number of convictions in those States, and best\nI can back-of-the-envelope it, we're talking about maybe I\nthink less than 10 people per year.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In those -- in those six\nStates or those few States --\nMR. REICHMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- have those States all made\nclear they'd say we will never apply laches, or is it just\nthe case that there have never -- there's never been an\ninstance where the laches issue was presented to them?\nMR. REICHMAN: The latter is more accurate. I'm\n-- I'm -- I was trying not to overreach, but I went with\nthe cases that States that were clear that laches would\napply either by statute or by case law.\nAnd why this becomes particularly important to\nme is because we think the petitioner's rule serves the\nends of the Federal court overall, especially when you're\ntalking about finality because it seems to be the tail\nwagging the dog, in a way, to have a rule that cuts off\nthe possibility of the 10-year scenario for these few\ncases and then causes thousands of placeholder petitions\nto be filed and managed. And it has been pointed, you\nknow, average non-merits dismissal, we're talking about\nroughly 260 days. It's a burden on the court that's\nunnecessary, particularly to bring it back, when we think\nthat in light of Custis and Daniels, the plain language\ntakes us all the way there.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I know -- I know -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But do you have any\nexplanation of why your client waited so long?\nMR. REICHMAN: The record doesn't reveal except\nthat he is pro se.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Pro se.\nMR. REICHMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even -- that was the question\nI was going to ask. With respect to -- he came into\nFederal court and he said -- a little -- like 3 days too\nlate to move to extend the time to file the 2255. That\nmotion was denied. That motion was made in April of '97,\nand then he doesn't file for State habeas to get rid of\nthose prior convictions until February of '98. Is -- is\nthere any indication of why, when the Federal court says\nwe're not going to extend your time, he waits so long to\ngo to the State court?\nMR. REICHMAN: There's -- I'm aware of the\nfacts, but there's none in the record other than the fact\nthat he's pro se and has limited education.\nI want to point out one thing that -- that I\nthink is important perhaps, if -- if the Court were to go\na way of equitable tolling, which as I've said, I don't\nbelieve is appropriate. But you mentioned that it was 3\ndays too late that he filed. Looking back at the record,\nI -- I don't think that's accurate. It shows that it was\nreceived by the court on April 25th, 1997, which is 1 day\nafter the grace period under AEDPA which -- it expired on\nApril 24th, 1997. Well, he did it by mail, and under the\nmailbox rule, that would have been a timely motion to the\nextent that we are concerned with equitable tolling and -\nand permitting the placeholder petition of that kind.\nBut again, this -- this difficulty in managing\nthe process is familiar to the court because it -- it's\nwhat happens when you have these pro se petitioners.\nThe important thing in this case, we believe,\nthe core concern is with the plain language of the\nstatute. Because Daniels in substance said, the\nunderlying facts to a State court vacatur do not support a\nclaim, we believe that you have to read section 2255,\nparagraph (4) to say that, okay, then the operative fact\nis a vacatur.\nAnd this case -- it's a very real concern\nbecause without the prior convictions that were later\nvacated, Mr. Johnson would have a roughly 7-year sentence.\nThose prior convictions that were vacated -- and we all\ncan conclude now were unconstitutional -- added 8 more\nyears on his sentence. He's serving more time on the\nenhancements than he was on the underlying sentence. And\nof course, the sentencing scheme depends on reliability of\nthe information used for purposes of sentencing, and\nthat's why Congress chose to enact the fourth paragraph\nand the statute of limitations so that there would be an\nopportunity to correct unreliable information when it came\nto light and it was discovered.\nIf there are no further questions, I would\nreserve the remainder of my time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You may. Thank you.\nMr. Himmelfarb.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioner's State court habeas corpus petition,\nwhich challenged his guilty plea on a ground available at\nthe time of the plea, was filed nearly 9 years after the\nplea was entered and nearly 2 years after a subsequent\nFederal conviction became final. Petitioner,\nnevertheless, contends that the challenge to his Federal\nsentence was timely under AEDPA's 1-year statute of\nlimitations because it was filed within a year of the date\non which his State conviction was vacated. That\ninterpretation, which enables a defendant to extend the\nlimitation period for challenging his Federal conviction\nby delaying a challenge to his State conviction, is\nfundamentally at odds with the statutory text, the\nstatutory purpose, and the overall statutory scheme.\nTo begin with the statutory scheme, under clause\n(1) of AEDPA's limitation provision, the presumptive rule\nis that a defendant wishing to -- to collaterally\nchallenge a Federal conviction has a year from the date on\nwhich the conviction becomes final.\nClauses (2), (3) -- (2), (3), and (4) create\nexceptions to that general rule when a prisoner is unable\nto comply with the rule in clause (1) for reasons beyond\nhis control. The fundamental flaw in petitioner's\ninterpretation is that it would excuse compliance with the\npresumptive rule in clause (1) for a reason that is not\nbeyond his control, a failure to exercise diligence in\nchallenging his State conviction.\nPetitioner's interpretation is also inconsistent\nwith the statutory purpose of the limitation provision.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, are you saying that (4)\nis inapplicable?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No, Justice Kennedy. We agree\nthat (4) is applicable in a case like this. It's just\nthat our position is that petitioner's interpretation of\nit is wrong. We offer two alternative interpretations of\nhow paragraph 6(4) would apply in a case like this.\nBefore I get to them, I'd like to respond to a\nquestion that you asked when petitioner's counsel was\nstanding up here, and that had to do with the difficulty\nof getting everything that needed to be done done in the\nspace of a year.\nIt's critical to keep in mind that in the\ntypical case of this type, the factual basis for the State\nclaim is going to available at the time of the State\nguilty or trial, which in almost every case is going to be\nyears before the Federal conviction becomes final. And\nsince the limitation provision under AEDPA runs from the\nlatest of the four dates, in a typical case a defendant is\ngoing to have many years to seek the vacatur of a State\nconviction and he'll have up until a year after his\nFederal conviction becomes final to challenge it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But do you agree with your\nopponent that most States have their own limitations\nperiod that will reduce the number of cases in which there\ncan be inordinate delay?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Some States do have statutes of\nlimitations. Many don't. Massachusetts is a prime\nexample. It doesn't. Many of the cases of this type that\ncome through the Federal courts arise based on a -- a\nvacated Massachusetts conviction. My understanding is\nthat perhaps as many as half the States don't have\nlimitation provisions in non-capital cases.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But he says some of them have\ndoctrines of laches that would kick in.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I think that's -- that -- that\nmay well be true, Justice Stevens, but laches is a much\nmore -- a -- a case-by-case -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It -- it does seem to me that\nthe State has a greater interest than the Federal\nGovernment does in the finality of its own convictions,\nand so the State would be the primary guardian of\npreventing dilatory tactics, it would seem to me.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: The -- the State does have an\ninterest. The problem is that when there's a delay in\nfiling a challenge to a State conviction, one of two\nthings can be happen -- can happen, and the cases bear\nthis out. One is that you have a State prosecutor who is\nperfectly diligent and wants to defend the conviction but,\nbecause of the lapse of time, can't because the requisite\nrecords aren't available. The other thing you see in some\nof these cases is that because the State sentence has been\nserved by the time it's challenged in cases of this type,\nthe State prosecutor doesn't have the same kind of\nincentive -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, as to your first -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I was going to say that. What\n-- what -- excuse me.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- as to your first -- as to\nyour first instance, if there's lack of diligence, then\nthere's laches. If the records are destroyed, somebody\nsits on their rights and the records are destroyed, then\nyou have an obvious defense of laches.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: The -- the important point,\nJustice Kennedy, is the limitation provision at issue here\nhas to do with the finality of Federal convictions.\nCongress was concerned that challenges to Federal\nconvictions not be -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we're -- yes, I -- I\nrecognize that that's going to be the ultimate issue, but\nyour point was, oh, well, the State is powerless because\nthe prosecutor might not have the records. The States\nhave laches provisions precisely for that circumstance.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Kennedy, we're not\nsaying that States are powerless, and there are many\ncases, probably the majority of them, where States do\ndiligently defend their own convictions in cases of this\ntype. Unfortunately, the reported cases show that there\nare many cases where either they're not able to or they're\nunwilling to because the State sentence has long since\nbeen served.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Himmelfarb -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, in this case now, the\npetitioner did obtain a vacatur of the two State\nconvictions. Isn't that so? Don't we accept that as a\nfact in this case?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Yes, Justice O'Connor. He\nactually obtained vacatur of seven prior State\nconvictions, only one of which was relevant to the career\noffender sentence that he received in the Federal case.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But he did succeed. And then\nwe have to look at whether the petitioner has complied\nwith section 2255 of AEDPA. And so we look to subpart\n(4), do we not, in this case to answer that?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, in a case of this type,\nyou would have to look to both subpart (1) and subpart (4)\nand determine which one gives him more time, and whichever\none gives him more time is the one that applies. We think\nthat 6(1) applies because under 6(4) he waited far too\nlong to challenge his State conviction.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that's possible, but\nyou also question whether the vacatur can be a fact under\nsubsection (4).\nMR. HIMMELFARB: We don't really, Justice\nO'Connor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I think the lower court placed\nsome weight on that idea. We don't dispute that if a\nconviction is a fact, the vacatur can be as well.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay. You think that the -\nthe vacatur here could be a fact, but then you say that\neven so, the petitioner didn't go back to State court\ndiligently and on a timely basis.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's exactly right. The\ntextual language we rely on is not fact or facts\nsupporting the claim, but rather could have been\ndiscovered through the exercise of due diligence.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And you say he was not\ndiligent in challenging those convictions.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's -- that's absolutely our\nposition, Justice O'Connor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's -- go on.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would -- would you comment on\n-- on one difficulty I have with what, I take it, is your\npreferred position of measuring due diligence from -- as I\nunderstand it, from the -- the date at which the State\nconviction became final?\nMost of these -- I think it is fair to say that\nmost of the State convictions, like most convictions in -\nin general, are going to rest on -- on guilty pleas. It\njust is not realistic to assume that Congress assumed a\ndue diligence system which was going to require a State\ndefendant immediately to start a collateral attack on a\nguilty plea. I mean, if -- if there -- if there were\nreasons for the collateral attack that seemed strong and\nworthwhile, he wouldn't have been entering the guilty\nplea.\nAnd it seems to me that if we're going to\nmeasure due diligence from the date of conviction, most\nconvictions resting on pleas, as a practical matter under\nyour system, a conviction that rests on a plea is never\ngoing to be subject to a timely challenge for purposes of\napplying 2255. Is -- is that a fair comment, or have I -\nhave I missed something?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No. We -- we disagree, Justice\nSouter. And if I could, I'd like to say a little bit\nabout the -- the proposal you made when petitioner's\ncounsel was up here about when the diligence could be\nmeasured from. And I think your suggestion was that it\ncould be measured from the time of the Federal conviction\nor -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: -- perhaps the time that\nFederal charges are brought because at that time, that's\nwhen the defendant has the incentive to -- to challenge\nthe State conviction. We obviously prefer that\ninterpretation to the one offered by petitioner.\nWe think the two that we offer are better than\nthat one for a couple of reasons. The first is that we\nthink that our two -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, would you comment\nspecifically on your preferred position which starts at\nthe very -- as I understand it, starts at the earliest\ndate, which would be the date of the State conviction?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. We think that's\nconsistent with the text because the diligence has to be\nconnected in some way to the facts supporting the claim,\nand we think you could take the view that in a case of\nthis type, particularly given the diligence requirement,\nthe facts supporting the claim either means the facts\nsupporting the State claim or it means the vacatur of the\nState conviction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but isn't it -- I guess my\nproblem is isn't -- isn't it a sense -- isn't your\nargument for a sense of diligence which is really other\nwordly? At the moment the defendant's conviction based\nupon his plea becomes final, it simply is unrealistic to\nexpect that any defendant would have an incentive to\nattack that conviction. And -- and the result, it seems\nto me, of -- of your position, your preferred position, is\nif -- if diligence is measured from that moment, that no\ndefendant will ever be diligent because no defendant will\never have an incentive at that point to be diligent.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, Justice Souter, the -- we\nthink that there's a -- a textual problem with the\ninterpretation you're offering because it doesn't tie\ndiligence to facts supporting a claim.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how about the one you're\noffering? Before you tell me why mine is bad, tell me why\nyours does not suffer the -- the -- at least I think, the\nobjection that I've -- I've raised?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Because it avoids the problem\nthat you could have a Federal conviction long after, years\nor a decade or a more after, the State conviction. And on\n-- on your view, you would not be -- the -- the petitioner\nwould not be required to challenge a State conviction for\na decade or more until after -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's -- that's right. But\nwhy is the requirement on your reading to challenge it\npromptly after it is entered in these plea situations, not\na just totally unrealistic requirement that will never be\nmet and will result in a consequence that all State\nconvictions, resting upon pleas, will be, in effect,\ninsulated from later collateral attack when -- under -\nfor purpose of 2255?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Souter, an argument\nalong those lines was actually raised in Daniels itself\nand rejected by the Court. And essentially what the Court\nsaid is that whatever the incentives may be at the time of\nthe State conviction, the remedies are available, the\nprocedures are available. And if a defendant does not\navail himself of those remedies and procedures, at a\nminimum he will know that so long as his State conviction\nremains on the books, if he goes out and commits another\ncrime, he runs a risk that he will be subject to an\nenhanced sentence based on the fact that he's committed\nthe prior crime. We think the same --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you say we're all stuck with\nthat.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I think that -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You don't mind, but -- if -- if\nyou think -- if you think there's anything to my\nobjection, you're in effect saying, too late.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I think that the arguments\nagainst your objection weigh in favor of our\ninterpretation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure I agree\nwith your argument, but I suppose one answer to Justice\nSouter is that you get the longer of (1) or (4), so that\nyou would always get at least 1 year. If the -- if the\nState conviction was 10 years prior to the Federal\nconviction and he waited and did nothing, I take it, he\nstill has 1 year because he gets the longer of the two\nprovisions.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's right, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is right? Because I thought\nthat Justice Souter provided that, but you don't because\nif you're relegated to (4) -- let's say it becomes final\nquickly. If you're relegated to (4), what you're saying\nis the date on which the facts supporting the claim could\nhave been discovered, if this is a conviction that took\nplace 10 years earlier, you are saying the date on which\nthose facts could have been discovered was 9 years earlier\nor whenever he could have brought it -- brought the claim\nin the -- in the State court.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. Under -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, therefore, it is not true\nthat he always has that year.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No. Under paragraph 6(4), what\nyou say is absolutely correct, as we see things.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: But the -- the limitation\nperiod under AEDPA runs from the latest of the four\ndates -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if the date of judgment\nbecame final prior to the running of (4), then he would\nnot have a year.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's true.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nNow, my question actually is the -- aside from\nJustice Souter's practical point, it seemed to me that the\nlanguage here is different from Daniels and different in\nthe other cases. The language is the date on which facts\nsupporting the claim or claims presented could have been\ndiscovered. And facts supporting the claim prior to there\nbeing a claim are not facts supporting the claim. And\ntherefore, it seems as if it would run no later than the\nmoment when he presents the Federal claim. No earlier\nthan that could it run. So you have a year from the time\nthat you present the Federal claim. At that point, all\nthose facts that could have been discovered earlier, now\nhe has a year to call them to the attention of the court.\nAnd of course, for reasons that you point out,\nthis is certainly a fact that could have been discovered\nearlier. He could have brought his motion long before.\nSo what's wrong with that? It combines the\npractical reason that Justice Souter mentioned with the\nlanguage of the statute.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Let me comment on the language,\nif I could. If one were to read the phrase, facts\nsupporting the claim, completely in isolation, keeping in\nmind only Daniels, but ignoring the broader statutory\ncontext and the statutory purpose, it might well be the\ncase that the better reading is that the facts supporting\nthe claim is the vacatur of the State conviction not the\nfactual basis for the State claim.\nBut if you take into account the broader\nstatutory context and statutory purpose, in particular if\nyou take into account the due diligence requirement, we\nthink the better reading is that facts supporting the\nclaim, in the context of this limitation provision, is the\nfactual basis for the State claim. It is true -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- I thought that you\nconceded at the outset that the facts supporting the claim\nis the vacatur. I -- I thought that you opened up with\nthat. And it -- it -\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No, Justice Kennedy. What I\nwas agreeing to was the idea that a vacatur of a\nconviction is a fact because in the lower court decision,\nthere seems to be some reliance on the idea that that's\nnot a fact at all. But in responding to Justice Breyer's\nquestion -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the minute -- the minute\nthat you -- you say that, it -- it seems to me that you\nhave to accept the petitioner's argument.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I don't think so, Justice\nKennedy, and here's why. It is a true in a case of this\ntype that the facts supporting the claim -- excuse me -\nthe factual basis for the State claim is not the facts\nsupporting the Federal claim in a direct or proximate or\nimmediate or sufficient sense. It is the facts supporting\nthe Federal claim in an indirect, a but for, a once\nremoved, or a necessary sense. If a defendant has served\nhis State sentence, he's been sentenced to an enhanced\nFederal sentence and he wants to challenge his Federal\nsentence and he's armed with a factual predicate for a\nState claim, so long as he takes the intermediate step of\ngoing into Federal court and obtaining a vacatur of the\nconviction, he can challenge his Federal sentence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm certainly not taking -\nadvocating the -- the defendant's position. I'm\nadvocating the position as follows.\nSuppose it were not a vacatur. Suppose it were\na DNA test, and suppose it were a fact that the DNA test\nidentified a different perpetrator of a long-gone State\ncrime and it was definite.\nNow, if no one thought of running that DNA test,\nalthough they should have, until 4 years after the Federal\nconviction, he's out of luck. He has 1 year from the\nFederal conviction, and that 1 year he has to, during that\nyear, do everything, including bringing facts into being,\nsuch as the result of the DNA test, that he had not\npreviously done. And that's consistent with the language.\nIt avoids Justice Souter's practical problem, and it does\nnot impose an unreasonable burden on the Government, I\nwouldn't think, because he has just a year from\nconviction.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Breyer, under our view,\nthe hypothetical you just gave would be one where a timely\n2255 motion could be filed. If the DNA evidence were\ndiscoverable in the exercise of due diligence only more\nthan a year after the Federal conviction became final such\nthat the defendant would not be within paragraph 6(1), he\nwould be able to file a timely 2255 motion under paragraph\n6(4) if, within a year from the date that the DNA evidence\nwas discoverable through the exercise of due diligence, he\nfiled his State motion to get his State conviction\nvacated, and allowing tolling of the period while the\nState motion is pending, then filed his Federal motion\nwithin that same 1-year period, he would be able to file a\ntimely 2255 motion. That's under our primary\ninterpretation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: From your answer, I take it\nthen you would agree with Judge Black in the Eleventh\nCircuit that equitable tolling would apply. He goes to\nState court within the year after his Federal conviction\nbecomes final. The State court is sitting on it for 2\nyears. The limitation, I take it from what you said,\nwould be tolled during that time.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's right, Justice Ginsburg.\nUnder our primary interpretation, there would be tolling\nduring the 1-year period of the time while the motion, the\nState motion, is pending in State court.\nOur alternative interpretation doesn't depend on\ntolling because it doesn't begin to run until the vacatur\nof the State conviction could have been obtained. So it's\njust the -- the time while the State motion is pending is\njust excluded from the calculation as a matter of course\nunder our second interpretation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May -- may I ask you sort of a\ngeneral background question? As I understand your basic\nposition, if the defendant lets things sit for too long,\nhe loses the right to challenge the State conviction. On\nthe -- and -- and what's -- what's at stake is an\nenhancement based on the -- on the prior conviction. Is\nthere ever a time when the Federal Government loses the\nright to use a very old conviction for enhancement\npurposes?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, under -- under the\nguidelines, depending upon the -- the length of the prison\nterm, I think very old convictions are not counted at all.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that right?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Yes. So -- so the length of\ntime from the date of the State conviction to the time of\nthe Federal sentencing can have a bearing upon what\nsentence he's going -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Whether he gets the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that also true under the\nArmed Career Criminal Act cases?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I -- I don't believe it is,\nJustice Souter. I don't think there's any kind of time\nlimitation there the way there is in the guidelines.\nThe -- the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure which way that\ncuts. In a -- in a sense, if that set of old convictions\nis out of the way, then you won't be troubled by the loss\nof records problem.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, that -- I think that's\nactually a critical point, Justice Kennedy, because our\nview is that a -- a State defendant should be required to\nchallenge his State conviction at the earliest possible\nopportunity, and in most cases that will be soon after his\nconviction in State court because that will be the time\nwhen he knows about the basis for his State claim. If he\ndoes that, by the time he gets to the Federal sentencing,\nyou're not going to have the issue in this case because\nall will agree that that vacated State conviction can't be\ncounted towards his Federal sentence. So that's one of\nthe virtues of the interpretation we offer. It avoids\nthis circumstance entirely.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're not -- you're not\ninsisting on that super diligence because you say, well,\nin every case he has at least a year to begin to try to\nundo the State conviction.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That -- that's right, Justice\nGinsburg. We agree with that.\nThe -- the purpose of AEDPA's limitation\nprovision, to use this Court's language in Duncan v.\nWalker, is to reduce the potential for delay on the road\nto finality by restricting the time that a prospective\nhabeas petitioner has in which to seek habeas review. We\nthink petitioner's interpretation is inconsistent with\nthat purpose not only because it permits a delay in\nchallenging the State conviction and, as a consequence, in\nchallenging the Federal sentence, but because it\nencourages it. As I mentioned before, the longer a\nprisoner waits to challenge his State conviction, other\nthings being the same, the greater the likelihood of\nsuccess either because the necessary records that the\nState would need to defend the judgment are unavailable or\nbecause the State prosecutor has less of an incentive to\ndefend it than he might have while the sentence was still\nbeing served.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Recently I -- I lost my\nluggage. I had to go to the lost and found at the\nairline, and the lady said has my plane landed yet.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I was kind of stopped by that\nquestion.\nIt seems to me this case is something like that.\nI mean, this is just not a question the -- the defendant\nasks until the Federal conviction arrives, which I -\nwhich I suppose that argues for your 1-year -\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, our -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- position, but it just seems\nto me that the purpose of this doesn't begin to run until\nhe's been sentenced. And then he has to go through all\nthe -- the questioning as -- as to whether or not his\nprior conviction is -- can be set aside, and he has to go\nto State court to do that.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, the -- the important\npoint is that -- we think is that petitioner's\ninterpretation doesn't work because it gives a defendant\nan indefinite period to challenge his State conviction,\nand the only diligence that's required under his\ninterpretation is that you have to exercise diligence in\nseeing whether the motion to vacate your State conviction\nwas granted whenever it was filed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that may be but that also\nmay be what it says. I -- I don't follow your\ninterpretation of what is the meaning of facts supporting\nthe claim or claims. I mean, once you say that the facts\nsupporting the claim is the vacatur of the -- of the State\nconviction, I mean, it seems that's the end of it.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and as for due\ndiligence, yes, it doesn't seem to make much sense in that\ncontext, but as pointed out by your friend on the other\nside, it makes sense in all other contexts and -- and you\ndon't expect the language to be applicable all the time.\nSo what's wrong with that?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: What's wrong with it is that we\nthink it's not only inconsistent with the basic principle\nembodied in AEDPA's statute of limitations, we think it's\ninconsistent with the very idea of a statute of\nlimitations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It may well be, but that's how\nthey wrote it. I'm talking about the word facts.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Justice -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How can this be a fact\nsupporting the -- you -- you want us to say a fact\nsupporting the conviction includes the facts that lead up\nto the facts supporting the conviction or -- or supporting\nthe claim.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Scalia, if the Court\nrejects our view that the facts supporting the claim under\nparagraph 6(4) as the factual basis for the State claim,\nwe think it should still reject petitioner's\ninterpretation and should adopt our alternative\ninterpretation which is not subject to that objection\nbecause our alternative interpretation assumes that the\nfacts supporting the claim is the vacatur of the State\nconviction. But in light of the due diligence requirement\nat the end of paragraph 6(4), the question is when could\nthat vacatur have been obtained and thus discovered\nthrough the exercise of due diligence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, you're saying\ndue diligence applies to an extraneous fact when you\ncould, in the simple sense, discover it. It applies to a\ngenerated fact when you could have generated it.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's absolutely our position,\nJustice Souter.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask sort of a broad\nquestion? Am I correct in assuming that this really isn't\nthe most important case we ever heard because it only\naffects a handful of enhancements that don't really affect\nthe basic conviction or sentence; and secondly, that it's\nclear that the -- from both the text of the statute and\nwhatever we know about the legislative history, that it's\na problem Congress never even thought about?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: As to your first question,\nJustice Stevens, one -- one would think that this is a\nlittle bit of an unusual situation and you don't see too\nmany cases where it arises. Perhaps surprisingly, though,\nthere are quite a few reported decisions where this\narises. There is a 2 to 1 circuit split on this question.\nThere are some district courts from other circuits that\nhave weighed in. I believe there may be three or four\ncertiorari petitions pending in this Court from the\nEleventh Circuit that raise the same question.\nAs to whether Congress ever considered this\nsituation, I'm not aware of anything in the legislative\nhistory that is an affirmative indication that it did. It\ncould well be -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And certainly they would have\nphrased the statute one way or the other more clearly.\nThey could have done that.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That could well be, but of\ncourse, it wouldn't be the -- the first time the Court\nconfronted a situation where there's a statutory text and\nthere's a set of facts that Congress didn't necessarily\nconsider when it was writing the text.\nSo we think our -- either our primary or our\nfall-back position is preferable to petitioner's\ninterpretation for the fundamental reason that his\ninterpretation does not require diligence. It enables the\ndefendant to extend the limitation period through his own\nactions, and we think it's simply foreign to the whole\nnotion of statutes of limitations to say that the\nlimitation period can be determined by actions that are\nwithin the prisoner's control.\nThe court of appeals -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You certainly -- wouldn't you\nbe making the opposite argument if it were a DNA test? If\nit were a DNA test, you would certainly be arguing that\neven though the results didn't come into existence until\n32 years after his Federal conviction, that he could have\ndiscovered it 38 years before because he could have asked\nthat the test then be performed.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, Justice Breyer, the\nquestion of whether a fact supporting a claim could have\nbeen discovered through the exercise of due diligence is a\nvery fact-specific question which -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then -- then once\nyou admit that, you're going to have to find a difference\nbetween this and the DNA test, or your position here, if\nadopted, will catch you out there.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No. We don't think so because\nwe think that the analysis should be the same for this\ncase as it is for your typical case involving a statute of\nlimitations with a discovery rule. The question is on the\nfacts of this case, when could the factual basis of the\nclaim been discovered given the totality of the\ninformation available to the plaintiff through the\nexercise of due diligence. So we think it's precisely the\nsame situation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you're still asking us -- I\nmean, even -- even in your fall-back position -- your -\nyour principal position asks us to -- to play games with\nthe -- with the word facts, and your fall-back position\nasks us to play games with the word discovered. You want\nus to read discovered to mean either discovered or\nobtained, which discovered just doesn't mean obtained. It\njust doesn't.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, you're right, Justice\nScalia. The fall-back position presumes the correctness\nof petitioner's interpretation of facts supporting the\nclaim.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb.\nMr. Reichman, you have, I think, 8 minutes left.\nI'm not -- I'm sure you don't really need all 8.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF COURTLAND REICHMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. REICHMAN: I hope not.\nThe Government's position boils down to this.\nThey're advocating for the statute they want, not the\nstatute they have. This statute says the fact that could\nhave been discovered with exercise of due diligence. And\nonce -- as this Court -- several Justices have recognized\nonce you admit that the vacatur is a fact, the\nGovernment's entire argument unravels because what the\nGovernment would have -- this Court holds -- is that the\nfacts supporting the claim is exactly what it held it\ncouldn't be in Daniels.\nThe -- underlying the Government's argument is,\nI think, a principle that -- that does not make sense.\nIt's that the State can't be trusted to handle the\nchallenges to prior convictions. I think that is not only\nagainst experience. It also cuts against this Court's\ndecisions, in particular, about Daniels. It talked about\nthe State having a strong interest in maintaining its\nconvictions.\nThe idea about AEDPA and finality I think is\nalso important. To answer your question, Justice Stevens,\nno, this is not the most important case this Court has\never heard. And I think that that ties into an important\npoint. To use my rough numbers, we're talking about at\nthis point with the six States, less than 10 guys that\nmight be in this 10-year scenario per year. I think\nprobably the number is more like three people per year.\nAnd if the Brackett court, the court on the front lines\ndown there in the district court, the First Circuit is\nright, we're talking about the results of the Government's\nrule to be that thousands of placeholder petitions will be\nfiled so that petitioners don't lose their rights to\nchallenge their Federal sentence based on the vacatur of\ntheir prior sentences. And when -- when I think about\nwhat serves the ends of the statute and finality overall,\nI think that to prolong all these other cases, these\nthousands of cases --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would you need the\nplaceholder if the rule were, as Judge Black said it\nshould be, that if you go to the State court within the 1\nyear after your Federal conviction becomes final, then the\ntime that you are in the State court the statute will be\ntolled? If that's the rule, then you don't need any\nplaceholder filings.\nMR. REICHMAN: Two responses to that. First, if\nthat is the rule, I'm not sure I read the Eleventh Circuit\nto be so crisp on it that you definitely get tolling. I\nthink it was a case-by-case determination. And anytime\nyou're in a soft -- what I call soft equitable tolling\nsituation where you don't know for sure, that's going to\nlead to placeholder petitions.\nAlternatively, if we're talking about a rule\nthat's a hard equitable tolling rule, that is, there is\ntolling every time there's the pendency of the State\npetition, well, it seems to me that we are adding a\nprovision very expressly to the statute that doesn't\nexist. 2244 has exactly that tolling provision, and that\nis not in this -- in the 2255 provision. And this Court\nwould be adding it, and we don't think that is\nappropriate.\nAt the end of the day, there's been a question\nabout doesn't a tie go to the Government in this case\nbecause of finality. That is, if both interpretations are\nequally plausible, because of finality, doesn't it go to\nthe Government? Of course, you've heard me contest we\ndon't think it's a tie. We also don't think finality cuts\nin the favor of the Government.\nBut even assuming we have a tie, we think that\n-- that should -- the tie goes to the petitioner because\nthis statute is recognized in Clay as in derogation of\ncommon law, and statutes and derogation of common law are\nto be strictly construed.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Reichman.\n"
