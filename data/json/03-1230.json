        "content": "(10:11 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in American Trucking Associations v. Michigan Public\nService Commission and a companion case.\nMr. Digges.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT DIGGES, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 03-1230\nMR. DIGGES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case is a challenge to Michigan's $100 per\ntruck flat annual fee that is imposed on all trucks that\nare registered to do point-to-point operations in the\nState of Michigan. We submit that this fee, this flat per\ntruck fee, has the same impermissible effects on\ninterstate commerce as the two flat truck fees that were\nstruck down by this Court in American Trucking\nAssociations v. Scheiner.\nIn the American Trucking Associations v.\nScheiner case, this Court looked at the practical effect\nof these fees and found that because of their\nunapportioned structure, that the fees had four\ninterrelated types of impermissible effects on interstate\ncommerce.\nFirst, the Court found that these kinds of flat\nfees were a financial barrier against out-of-state motor\ncarriers even coming into the State that imposed the --\nthe fee. There's no question in this case that the\nMichigan flat fee has the same kind of protectionist\nquality.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it -- it does for trucks\nthat want to deliver things within the State of Michigan.\nIt doesn't for anybody else.\nMR. DIGGES: Yes, it -- it discriminates and it\n-- it has an exclusory effect on trucks -- out-of-state\ncarriers that want to compete in the -- and bring their\ntrucks across the -- the border of Michigan and compete\nagainst local carriers for intrastate hauls.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It would have that -- it\ncertainly has that tendency. Do we have -- do we know in\nfact what the effect is? Is it deterring anybody? How\nmany trucks does it affect?\nMR. DIGGES: There was not a trial below. So we\ndon't have that fact.\nWe believe that as in the Scheiner case, these\n-- these tendencies are inherent there. Because of the\nstructure of the fee, it not only has this effect, it has\nwhat this Court called a hydraulic pressure effect, and\nthat is to -- for carriers, once they have paid this fee\nas an entrance fee, to pull their trucks out of interstate\ncommerce and to concentrate them into -- in the State of\nMichigan in the local activities. And that -- in fact,\nthe State acknowledges that. Below, the State said that\nmotor carriers should allocate or dedicate their trucks to\nthe State of Michigan in order to avoid these\nconsequences. And even the Michigan Court of Appeals\nrecognized that, saying a local carrier would be\ndiscouraged from operating in interstate commerce.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, it also -- I mean,\nyou say it -- it favors the in-state -- intrastate carrier\nbecause if you're doing nothing but intrastate carriage,\nyou -- you amortize the $100 over many more miles, whereas\nthe interstate carrier, much of whose business is out-of-\nstate, doesn't do that.\nOn the other hand, you can certainly argue that\n-- that this tax discriminates against intrastate carriers\nin -- in another respect, that is to say, interstate\ncarriers who -- who do nothing within the State do not pay\nit, whereas the -- the Michigan carrier that does a lot of\ninterstate business but if he does one piece of intrastate\nbusiness -- interstate business, he still pays it. Isn't\nthat right?\nMR. DIGGES: Well, Your Honor, I think what --\nwhat that's saying -- and I know that was the argument\nmade in the Solicitor General's brief -- is that you can\ndiscriminate against one component of interstate commerce,\nthose carriers that want to actually compete and do\nintrastate business in the State, as long as you give a\nbenefit to another component of interstate commerce, those\nwho just wish to operate in the -- in the State of\nMichigan in interstate commerce.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's not so much that you\nnecessarily can do it, but it -- it sort of interrupts the\n-- the kind of the a priori reasoning and you're thrown\nback on a -- on -- on a practical effects analysis under\nPike.\nMR. DIGGES: No, Your Honor. I think what\nhappens is that -- that there are the segment of carriers\nthat would like to compete against intrastate carriers.\nThe fact that other carriers may be getting a break in\nterms of regulatory fees -- and we don't know that to be\nthe truth, getting the other interstate carriers. It's\nthe Boston Stock Exchange, and I think it was said again\nin the Scheiner case that -- that you can't discriminate\namong interstate carriers.\nAnd as we pointed out in our brief, you could\nset up a situation in which a -- a State discriminated in\nfavor of interstate carriers in situations or industries\nwhere their locals had no interest in competing, but where\ntheir -- their locals were interested in competing, they\ncould set up a discriminatory system. So you can protect\ntimber industry in -- in Oregon and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But may I ask this question?\nSuppose you have an interstate carrier that does 100,000\nmiles of business in Michigan and you have an intrastate\ncarrier that does a 100,000 miles of business in Michigan.\nThey both say the -- pay the same tax, don't they?\nMR. DIGGES: If they each do 100,000 miles of\nintrastate business in Michigan --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. DIGGES: -- they would pay the same flat\nfee.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They would both pay the same\ntax, both the intra and the interstate. Now, that doesn't\nsound to me like discrimination against either one.\nMR. DIGGES: If -- if this -- if this tax was\napportioned based on mileage, it would not be\ndiscrimination, but unfortunately, it is not and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I'm just saying if the\nintrastate and interstate carriers both have the same\nintrastate mileage, they both pay the same tax.\nMR. DIGGES: And we -- we would -- and again, if\nthis was a mileage-apportioned fee, it would be -- it\nwould be fine. But the fact is as in Scheiner, the out-\nof-state carriers, because the interstate carrier is -- is\noperating --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but you might have an\nintrastate carrier that does a smaller amount of mileage,\nonly 50,000 miles, and an interstate carrier that pays --\ndoes 100,000 miles. They both pay the same tax too. And\neverybody is treated alike on their intrastate business.\nMR. DIGGES: That would be true but that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the tax only operates on\nintrastate business.\nMR. DIGGES: The factual situation is going to\nbe that the interstate carrier is just not going to have\nthe opportunity to do as much business in Michigan as the\nintrastate carrier.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it seems to me you should\nhave introduced some evidence on that point. I mean, it\n-- it really is an assumption of your unfairness argument\nthat purely intrastate carriers do significantly more\nintrastate business than interstate carriers who choose to\ndo some interstate business. Now, does that strike you as\nself-evident? It does not need any --\nMR. DIGGES: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- demonstration?\nMR. DIGGES: It does strike me as self-evident.\nIn fact, to courts below -- we have -- we've made this\nargument. We've seen this argument now. The cases have\ncalled it intuitively obvious. And from the discussion of\n-- in the Scheiner case and from the discussion in the\nNippert case, the very difference between interstate and\nintrastate commerce means that on average the interstate\ncarrier is just not going to use the State's facilities as\nmuch as the in-state carrier.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Wouldn't we be better\nable to decide this question after a trial rather than\nspeculation on both sides?\nMR. DIGGES: I don't think a trial is necessary\nbecause, as I say, this -- this Court quoted Justice\nFrankfurter clearly, and I think the Solicitor General in\nhis brief says that on average the out-of-state carrier is\nnot going to get as much benefit from this fee. This is a\nvariable cost fee. In effect, the out-of-state carrier is\nhaving to pay more than its fair share of the cost of the\n-- of the State's regulatory system. And again, that's\nsomething that was accepted in the Scheiner case, accepted\nin -- in the Nippert case. And the intrastate carrier --\nevery time that it operates in the State, it is using that\nprivilege.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, Nippert was over\n100 years ago, wasn't it?\nMR. DIGGES: I think the Nippert case was from\nthe 1940's I believe. In any event, as we've been\ndiscussing --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: It seems like 100\nyears ago.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DIGGES: It's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Digges, this -- the --\nthe -- there was a question about the ramifications of the\nposition that you're presenting. That is, there are many\nsituations in which there is some kind of licensing fee\nthat is imposed on everyone, the same dollar amount,\nalthough some people who are licensed will be doing\nbusiness in other States and have to get licenses there as\nwell. The example that was featured in the -- in the\nbriefs on the other side of the lawyer who is licensed,\nsay, in Massachusetts and also in D.C. does not get any\nbreak on his D.C. Bar admission because he is also\nadmitted in Massachusetts, and in fact, does most of his\npractice out-of-state, out of the District.\nMR. DIGGES: Yes, Your Honor. I know that --\nthat example was given. I think there are a variety of\nflat fees that would be unaffected by this. There are\nfees that would be administrative charges and -- and if\nall the State is doing is charging, for example, the cost\nof a background investigation or the cost of a truck\ninspection, a fixed cost, then it's fair to ask the\ncarrier to pay a fixed fee or to ask the taxpayer to pay a\nfixed fee.\nWith respect to the bar fees, they are obviously\ndifferent than the trucking industry and -- and the\ntaxation of an instrumentality in interstate commerce.\nBut we think that there may be impracticalities in\napportioning a bar fee. You could have an attorney in his\noffice in Virginia that is working for a California\ncustomer or California client that is being -- for a case\nthat is being tried in the court system of Oregon, and\nthen for transaction work, he could be working for a\ncustomer or a client in -- in Missouri for -- a multi-\nstate. So it may be difficult to apportion fees. We\nhaven't really examined that.\nBut we know from this Court's decisions that --\nthat is easy and can be apportioned for truck fees, and\ntruck fees -- this Court said in Scheiner that the\ntechnology is now available to look at the extent of the\nactivity and the taxpayer in -- in -- of the truck in the\nState, and later on in a subsequent decision said that you\ncan easily track large physical objects over States. So\nyou can apportion these fees on trucks to their mileage in\nthe State, to their loads, to the gross revenue associated\nwith the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Scheiner case didn't\nmake a distinction based on in-state activity. I thought\nthat that -- that flat fee was applicable to every motor\ncarrier that went on the roads in Pennsylvania.\nMR. DIGGES: That is accurate, Your Honor, but\n-- but nominally Scheiner -- for instance, the\nPennsylvania Supreme Court in the Scheiner case did say\nthat -- did uphold the fee because they said only\nPennsylvania could charge for the privilege of using\nPennsylvania's highways. So like a lot of -- like all\ninterstate commerce, you can always -- as -- as the Court\nsaid in Nippert, you can always find -- carve out a local\nactivity to say that this is going to be the focus of the\ntax.\nI think a problem here is with the -- the\napproach taken by the State and the Solicitor General is\nthey suggest that you go back to the days in which you're\ntrying to draw a line between interstate and intrastate\nactivity, this time not because the intrastate activity is\ngoing to be immune from the tax, but this time because\nyou're going to have some separate, different kind of test\napplicable to something that clearly is subject to\nCommerce Clause protections, but is -- is, in their view,\nsubject to a more lenient Commerce Clause protection. And\nI don't think this Court wants to retreat back to the days\nof having to draw a line between interstate and intrastate\ncommerce and -- and then having separate tests.\nIf there are no more questions, I'd like to\nreserve the rest of my time for rebuttal. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Digges.\nMr. Hanson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES H. HANSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 03-1234\nMR. HANSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn contrast to the ATA case, the question before\nthe Court today in the Mid-Con case is whether the fee on\nvehicles operating solely in interstate commerce is\npreempted by 49 U.S.C., section 14504.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It's the same fee we're\ntalking about.\nMR. HANSON: It is --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But a different theory of\ninvalidity.\nMR. HANSON: It is not the same fee. The -- the\nfee under subsection (1) that ATA is arguing about is an\nintrastate fee charged only to --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Intrastate.\nMR. HANSON: -- carriers that engage in\nintrastate activities.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay, and yours is the\ninterstate fee.\nMR. HANSON: The subsection (2) fee under\n478.1 --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And your fee applies to all\nMichigan-plated vehicles. Am I correct about that?\nMR. HANSON: That are operating solely in\ninterstate commerce.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do -- do I understand that the\ntwo distinctions in what is done with the -- or the way\nthe fee is collected and what's done with it is that the\n-- the fee is charged against the -- is it the operator as\nopposed to the owner, if there is a distinction? Is -- is\nthat correct?\nMR. HANSON: All of the fees under subsections\n(1) and (2) are charged against the motor carrier --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The carrier.\nMR. HANSON: -- or --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's the term I should use.\nMR. HANSON: -- motor carrier, not to the owner.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Which may not be the owner.\nAnd number two, as I understand it, as distinct\nfrom the registration fee, this fee goes to a different\nState department. Is that right?\nMR. HANSON: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Now, let -- that's -- that's a\npremise for a question I want to ask you, and the question\nis in economic effect, is there any difference really\nbetween charging this $100 fee with those differences from\nthe registration fee and simply jacking up the\nregistration fee by $100? Would there -- would there be\nany economic difference to the -- to the public or -- or\nindeed even to the carriers if they simply jacked up the\n-- the registration fee by $100? Because the -- the\nregistration fee is passed on to the carrier, if it's not\nthe owner, and the carrier -- it doesn't make any\ndifference to the carrier whether the -- whether the State\ndiverts the $100 up front or -- or divides the -- the\nregistration fee after it's paid. So is there any\neconomic difference?\nMR. HANSON: Yes, there is and the reason why\nthere is a difference is that the -- the fees that are\npaid for plating are under the -- under the International\nReciprocity Plan, the registration plan, the IRP. And\nthat is an apportioned fee. It is charged to all\nvehicles, all commercial motor vehicles, regardless of\nwhether it's for-hire or private, regardless of it's in-\nstate or -- of interstate. So everybody pays their\napportioned amount based on mileage.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that shows -- that --\nmaybe I don't understand. That -- that tells us what happens\nto the money after it's paid, but it doesn't make any\ndifference to the person who is paying the money, does it?\nMR. HANSON: Yes, it does.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Except that he only has to pay\nin one place, and -- and if they --\nMR. HANSON: He pays --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- increase the registration\nfee, he'd only have to pay in one place, once.\nMR. HANSON: But he would only pay the fee based\non his mileage in the State. It is not a flat fee if it\nis put onto the IRP fees. Those --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Who -- who sets the fee for\nthe plating?\nMR. HANSON: The -- the State does. It is\nadministered by the Michigan Secretary of State --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So --\nMR. HANSON: -- but I believe all of those are\nstatutory fees.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you could have -- unlike\nthe -- the fee, the $10 fee, that --\nMR. HANSON: The SSRS.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the Federal cap, this\nwould -- for plating it could be anything each individual\nState chooses it to be?\nMR. HANSON: In terms of the plating fee?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. HANSON: Each State is free to charge its --\nits own amount as the plating fee.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but it -- so -- so\nregardless of what Michigan does with the apportioned\namounts, the amount it charges to the -- to the owner, in\nthe case of the -- the plating fee, is -- is simply set by\nthe State of Michigan.\nMR. HANSON: That is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. HANSON: -- that is correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So what -- and -- and the --\nthe virtue of the apportionment is that the -- that the\nowner or the -- or the owner, I guess in this case, does\nnot have to pay fees in 49 other States.\nMR. HANSON: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But he doesn't -- it doesn't\nmatter to -- that's the value to him. It doesn't matter\nto him how they apportion whatever that fee is that\nMichigan charges.\nMR. HANSON: If they apportion it, however, it\nis -- it is not -- it does not -- if they put it into the\nIRP, it is not part of the registration process. The\nthing that the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But who -- I mean, is -- that's\n-- that's fine as a matter of administration, but in terms\nof the -- the end effect on the person who has to pay it\nand on the consumers to whom it is ultimately passed on,\nwhat difference does it make?\nMR. HANSON: Well, the -- the difference for the\nperson who is paying it under IRP is that if only 20\npercent of their interstate miles as a solely interstate\noperating carrier, if only 20 percent are in the State,\nthey would, in fact, only pay $20 per vehicle.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask a quick question?\nThe -- there are three things. Were -- were you finished?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I don't think he -- I\ndidn't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand your answer.\nIf you were finished, I don't understand.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. HANSON: If it's -- if it is put into a\nplating charge as opposed to a registration -- part of the\nregistration of a carrier for the privilege or the\nopportunity to carry on interstate trucking activities in\nthe State of Michigan, that is the flat fee that we're\ntalking about. Under the SSRS we believe that $100 charge\nexceeds the $10 maximum and is therefore preempted.\nIf they put it into the IRP, that -- IRP is\ncharged against the owner of the vehicle, paid against the\nSecretary of -- paid to the Secretary of State. It is not\na qualification under -- for the privilege of engaging in\ninterstate trucking in the State of Michigan.\nThe SSRS sets up the standards by which a\ncarrier becomes qualified to operate in the State.\nMichigan exceeds those standards. If you put those fees\ninto the IRP fees, then the carrier -- or then the owner\nof the vehicle pays only the proportionate amount based on\nhis mileage in the State.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?\nSupposing the -- Michigan changed its system and said\nwe're going to charge you $90 for -- as a plating fee.\nWe're only talking about vehicles that are plated in\nMichigan. We're going to charge you $90 for a plating fee\nand now we're going to take 10 -- what used to part of the\n$100 and another $10 registration fee. Would that be\npermissible?\nMR. HANSON: It would be permissible because the\n-- if the $10 is charged to the carrier as part of the\nregistration process, in order to be qualified to engage\nin interstate trucking. The $90 would be charged to the\nowner of the vehicle and would be paid on an apportioned\nbasis under IRP.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. What if he said $20\ninstead of $10?\nMR. HANSON: If he said $20 was going to be put\ntowards the -- the State instead of -- instead of $100?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. HANSON: And $80 towards IRP?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. HANSON: In that case, that would still\nviolate the -- the SSRS, if it is done as part of the\nregistration process, which is what Michigan does.\nMichigan -- even though you're properly SSRS registered,\nMichigan still requires, under its SSRS form -- it directs\nthe carrier to specifically identify vehicles by make,\nmodel, and serial number to obtain a decal by paying $100\nfor that fee. If they pay $20, that exceeds the $10\nmaximum that Congress set up in the SSRS in order to be\nqualified to operate in interstate trucking in the State\nof Michigan, as an interstate carrier in -- in Michigan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- that assumes it's\nan SSRS charge, and the State denies that it -- it has\nanything to do with SSRS. Don't you have to establish\nthat it's part of the SSRS program?\nMR. HANSON: I think what you have to do is you\nhave to look at what the -- the standards do. The -- the\nregistration standards in the SSRS are set up as the\nprocess by which a carrier has the privilege to enter into\ninterstate trucking activities in Michigan. When you look\nat the statute --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but what -- what if the\nState says, you can enter -- enter into interstate\nactivities for nothing? We're simply going to increase\nthe registration fee by $100. Couldn't the State do that?\nMR. HANSON: The State could do that and that\nwould be perfectly permissible.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So this is pure formalism.\nMR. HANSON: It is not pure form. Any -- what\n-- what Congress did was say that in order to qualify a\ncarrier -- they were concerned about the burdens. When\nISTEA was enacted in 1991, they were concerned about the\nburdens on carriers of individual State registration\nrequirements. And they sought to -- to alleviate that by\nmaking it so that carriers could only -- would only have\nto register in one State so they could do business in all\nStates on an interstate basis.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe they sought to but maybe\nthey didn't succeed. As I read the statute, it -- it\nreally applies to the -- the limitation of $10 only to\nthose fees that are SSRS fees, and these are not. So\nmaybe there's -- there's a hole in the Federal statute.\nMR. HANSON: And I don't believe that's the\ncase, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're trying to make the\nFederal statute work sensibly, but --\nMR. HANSON: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- I hate to tell you, but not\nall statutes work sensibly.\nMR. HANSON: Right.\nI think what you have to do, though, is go back\nand look at what Michigan does. Michigan has a -- a State\nstatute, 478.7(1), that says in order to operate to carry\nproperty on an interstate basis in Michigan, you must\nregister with the PSC and you must pay the required\nvehicle fees. The registration standards are what they do\nas in accordance with SSRS: insurance, service of\nprocess, and operating authority. Then you have to pay a\nfee, and the fee is limited to $10 per vehicle.\nIn the case of Michigan, those vehicle fees are\nset forth in two different sections of the statutes. One\nis .7(4), which is the $10 SSRS fee. The other one is\nsubsection -- it's 2(2). That fee is $100 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Hanson.\nMR. HANSON: -- in order for a Michigan-plated\nvehicle to engage in interstate commerce.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Your time is expired.\nMR. HANSON: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Boynton, we'll\nhear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY J. BOYNTON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. BOYNTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe petitioner, American Trucking, began its\nreply brief with the claim that the central reality in\nthis case is that the Michigan intrastate fee places\nsignificant burdens on interstate commerce. The Michigan\nCourt of Appeals rejected this claim squarely, saying that\nas a matter of -- that that was a matter of pure\nspeculation.\nThere's no evidence in the record before this\nCourt that the trucking companies' route choices are\naffected by the intrastate fee. Furthermore, there is no\nevidence in the record that the intrastate fee keeps\nanyone out from engaging in intrastate trucking in\nMichigan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It sure does make sense to me,\nthough. Surely it's the case that a company that does\nnothing but intrastate Michigan business will, by and\nlarge, log in many more miles intrastate than a company\nwhich does interstate business but part of its business is\nintrastate Michigan business. I -- I just -- it seems to\nme obvious that --\nMR. BOYNTON: Well, the Michigan Court of\nAppeals said that that very well may be the case, but they\npointed to the fact that there were no facts to support\nthat finding.\nAnd this is completely different than in\nScheiner. In Scheiner you had a -- a trial, you had\nevidence before the court. This Court noted that the --\nthe cost to an interstate trucker in that situation was\nfive times greater than the cost to a trucker that was in\nPennsylvania. You just simply don't have those facts\nhere.\nWhat you have is a discrete or a distinct local\nactivity that is something that doesn't affect the\ninterstate commerce.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it's the case that a\ncompany that does only intrastate Michigan business logs\nall of its miles on -- in Michigan. Right? No miles\noutside of Michigan.\nMR. BOYNTON: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it seems to me it's obvious\nthat a -- a company that does interstate business does not\nlog all of its miles in -- in Michigan, and likely --\nlikely -- very likely does -- does less miles in Michigan\nthan -- than a purely intrastate Michigan trucker.\nMR. BOYNTON: Well, Justice Scalia, that very\nwell may be true, but we don't have any way of -- of\nqualifying or quantifying the burden here because we don't\nhave those facts.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is it difficult to apportion\nthe intrastate fee based on the number of miles traveled\nintrastate?\nMR. BOYNTON: Well, Your Honor, I -- I think it\nis very difficult to do that. As the United States noted\nin its brief, they didn't think that mileage would be\nappropriate because this -- this fee doesn't support the\nmaintenance of the highways. What this fee does is allows\ntrucking companies or allows that truck to operate that\ntruck in intrastate business. So mileage isn't\nappropriate.\nOur position is that mileage isn't appropriate\nbecause it's next to impossible to try and figure out.\nWhat do you compare it to? Do you -- do you compare it to\ninterstate miles? Do you compare it to a ratio of\ninterstate -- intrastate to interstate? And if you do\nthat, how -- how can you come up with a accurate picture\nof, you know, what the value of that license is in\nMichigan? It may be --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does it make any difference\nhow high the -- the fee is set? If it were $10,000 a\ntruck, does that raise any concerns that are different?\nMR. BOYNTON: Well, Your Honor, the Michigan\nCourt of Appeals had taken the position that this was a\nfee, not a tax, and under a fee -- if -- if a fee was\n$10,000, if the expenses matched the -- the revenue from\nit, well, then it -- it would be a -- could be sustained\nas a fee. Now, if were a tax --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you defend that\nposition, that -- that it doesn't violate the Commerce\nClause so long as it's a fee not a tax?\nMR. BOYNTON: Your Honor, we think that the --\nif it's a fee and not a tax, the Michigan Court of Appeals\napplied the correct standard, and that was the standard of\nPike v. Bruce Church. And you would look to the --\nwhether the statute regulated even-handedly, whether it\naffected a legitimate local --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whenever it's a fee, not a tax,\nyou immediately go to Pike Church.\nMR. BOYNTON: I think that -- that that was what\nthe Michigan Court of Appeals --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I know. I know that's what\nthey said.\nMR. BOYNTON: Yes, and I -- I think that's a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I found it very strange.\nMR. BOYNTON: I think that's an appropriate\nmanner in dealing with it.\nBut if you -- if you look at the Michigan Court\nof Appeals opinion --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What makes it a fee instead\nof a tax other than the court saying so?\nMR. BOYNTON: Well, first of all, it provided a\ndirect benefit to the intrastate truckers. They were able\nto operate in the State of Michigan. Second of all, they\npointed out that it was in relation to the services\ngranted, being able to do that, and then the third\ncomponent would be the voluntariness, whether they could\nagree to -- they didn't have to engage in intrastate\ntrucking --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You could say the same about a\ntax. You could say, you know, you only have to pay this\ntax if you operate in Michigan. You don't want to\noperate; you don't have to pay it. And you could also say\nunless you pay the tax, you cannot operate in Michigan.\nDoes that make it a tax or a fee?\nMR. BOYNTON: Well, I think in the Michigan\nCourt of Appeals opinion, it -- it was a fee, and I think\n-- I think what we come back to, Your Honor, is the idea\nis there a specific class of individuals or businesses\nthat are benefitted. And I think that that's the\ndistinction between a fee and tax.\nAlso, a tax is a general revenue-raising\nmeasure, whereas a fee is not. And that's another\ndistinction of -- of a tax. And indeed, this Court -- in\nNational Cable Industry v. the United States, which we\ncited in our brief, this Court said as whether an exaction\nis a tax or a fee depends on whether its purpose is to\nraise revenue or regulate an industry or services.\nOne of the things --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'd like to get back just for\na moment --\nMR. BOYNTON: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- to the answer you gave\nabout apportionment because I wasn't quite sure I\nunderstood the answer. You said, well, apportionment is\nvery difficult. What are you supposed to do? What are\nyou -- what's the base? Well, and you said, should we\napportion against -- between in-state and out-of-state,\nand I would think the answer is yes. That's the whole\npoint.\nMR. BOYNTON: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if we're talking about\nmileage here, maybe this is something that's eminently\nsusceptible of apportionment. Now, it may be that\nadministratively this is just too expensive. That may be\n-- that may be a very valid argument.\nBut so far as saying that there's no basis for\napportionment, I didn't understand your answer.\nMR. BOYNTON: Well, I -- I -- maybe I misspoke\nmyself. What I really meant to say was it would be very\ndifficult to do. And in our joint appendix -- in the\njoint appendix --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It would be difficult to do\nadministratively. But -- just because of the cost of\ncollecting all the --\nMR. BOYNTON: Well, Your Honor, I think that you\ngot to look at what's the total cost here. The cost is\nnot only to the administrative aspect by the State, but\nthis imposes another cost on the truckers.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that -- I agree that\nthat is expensive. However, it seems to me that it would\nbe easier to do it with trucks which have miles than\nwith --\nMR. BOYNTON: But, Your Honor, the problem is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- than with, say, attorneys\nor accountants or whatever.\nMR. BOYNTON: Your Honor, the problem with that\nis that this fee, this intrastate fee, does not go to\nmaintain the highways as it was in Scheiner. They make\nthe argument that it's very easy that the mechanism --\nthey, being American Trucking, makes the argument that\nit's very easy to just start logging up the miles and --\nand you have the mechanism there.\nBut the difference between Scheiner and this\ncase is that in Scheiner you were measuring all intrastate\nmiles, any miles traveled within that State. And there's\na mechanism available administratively to do that. The\nIRP requires that.\nBut here you're not logging all intrastate\nmiles. You're only logging those miles in the State that\ninvolve a point-to-point delivery, from one intrastate\npoint to another. So you don't -- you'd have to get a\nwhole new record keeping or you'd have to keep track of a\nwhile different set of miles than you would with respect\nto the IRP.\nAnd that's the thing that I find striking about\nthis, that the American Trucking Association is basically\nsaying to its members that they want to have them do more\nrecord keeping on their part.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the American Trucking\nAssociation is -- is willing to be thrown into the -- into\nthe briar bush apparently. It certainly involves no -- no\ndifficulty for your Michigan intrastate truckers. All of\ntheir miles are intrastate. And the plaintiffs here say\nwe're -- we're willing to -- you know, to provide figures\nshowing how much of our carriage was -- was exclusively\nintrastate if you want to apportion.\nMR. BOYNTON: Well, that may be, Your Honor, but\nthe -- the point is -- what we're dealing with is a -- a\nfee that has revenues of about $3 million. And if you\nhave additional record keeping, how much of that $3\nmillion is going to have to be devoted to paying for the\nadministrative costs that are involved?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? Is\nthe fee payable before the -- a carrier may engage in\nbusiness or is it after the carrier has paid? Is it -- is\nit like a tax that's paid after the year is out?\nMR. BOYNTON: It's paid before. They -- they\nhave to have --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If you had to pay it before,\nthere would be no way to calculate it ahead of time\nbecause nobody would have had any mileage. Isn't that\ncorrect?\nMR. BOYNTON: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If you have to pay it before\nthe year begins and before you're allowed to engage in the\nbusiness, you would have no way of measuring the number of\nmiles you're going to travel during the -- the ensuing\nyear.\nMR. BOYNTON: That's correct. You would have to\nhave --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I suppose that's the same\nthing for the $10 fee for the whatever the acronym is\nthere. That's paid at the beginning of the year, isn't\nit? And it has to be apportioned among the States. And\nyou don't know how to apportion it at the beginning of the\nyear.\nMR. BOYNTON: Now, you're talking about the\ninterstate fee, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right, right. But I'm saying\nthe same problem arises when you do any apportioning.\nMR. BOYNTON: Well, it -- let me back up. The\nreason I asked with you -- when you were referring to the\n$10 fee is because the intrastate fee -- we have a $10\ncomponent in that as well. You can obtain a temporary fee\nfor $10 for 72 hours to conduct an intrastate operation.\nSo the statute in -- structurally has some apportionment\nfactor in it. So you don't have to necessarily buy the\n$100 intrastate fee decal to conduct intrastate\noperations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's like a 3-day fishing\nlicense.\nMR. BOYNTON: I suppose that would be one way --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How -- how does that work in\n-- in practice? Is it easily accessible? Suppose the\ncompany --\nMR. BOYNTON: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- wants to fill up its truck\nand -- and it said, well, this is going to be -- the only\nhaul this season for me, so I want the 3-day permit.\nMR. BOYNTON: Yes, Your Honor, you can obtain\nthe permits in advance. You don't have to have trucks\nlined up at the border waiting to get a decal or get a\npermit. You can purchase them in advance. So that --\nthat's available to the truckers.\nThe one thing I should mention, though, is you\nhave to have one -- you already have to have one vehicle\nlicensed intrastate. You already have to have paid the\nfee on one vehicle, and then you would be eligible to\npurchase additional temporary permits as the need arose\nbased on seasonal needs or an emergency situation. So\nthat -- that allows the -- the statute -- I -- I would\nsubmit to Your Honor, allows some apportioning in and of\nitself.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This -- this applies only to\noperations that are both licensed and registered in\nMichigan. Is that so?\nMR. BOYNTON: No. Your Honor I think is\nreferring to the interstate fee --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Right, right, yes.\nMR. BOYNTON: -- which is a different fee, which\nis in the Mid-Con case.\nOur position --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are you going to address the\nMid-Con question?\nMR. BOYNTON: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are you going to address the\nMid-Con question?\nMR. BOYNTON: I was going to do that right now,\nYour Honor.\nThe position that the State of Michigan and the\nMichigan Public Service Commission has is the SSRS does\nnot preempt the interstate fee. And the reason for that\nis --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what's the point of the\nlimitation in SSRS to $10 if the State can impose any\nadditional fee it wants just by calling it a different\nname?\nMR. BOYNTON: Well, Your Honor, I think what you\nhave to realize is you have -- when you look at the text\nof the statute, I think what is very clear from reading\nthe text is that the SSRS does not preempt all State fees\nand charges on motor carriers. It only preempts those\nfees and charges that are specifically related to the\nregistration of that motor carrier's interstate authority.\nThe interstate fee, or the Michigan-plated vehicle fee\nhere, is not preempted because it's a regulatory fee that\ndoes not relate to the registration of the motor carrier's\nSSRS interstate authority.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, it -- it does.\nNumber one, it's somewhat suspect at the outset because it\napplies only to interstate travel.\nMR. BOYNTON: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and then the -- the\nother vehicles pay $100 for the -- for the in-state fees,\nand so this seems to me that -- that on -- on its face\nshows that it's like a registration fee.\nMR. BOYNTON: Well, Your Honor, I think a couple\nthings. Number one, I think that -- I believe that if you\nlook at the structure of the Michigan statute, you'll see\nthat under section 2, which contains both the interstate\nfee and the intrastate fee, virtually all Michigan\nvehicles that are plated in Michigan -- the effect of it\nis that all vehicles that are plated in Michigan will have\npaid this $100 fee.\nAnd furthermore, if you look at section 7 of the\nMichigan statute, which is 478.7, that involves the\nregistration procedure. That's specifically applicable to\nthe registration of interstate authority. And within that\nsection 7, subsection (4) deals with the payment of the\n$10 fee for -- and -- and it's to be made by vehicles that\nare not plated in the State of Michigan.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's -- that's the problem.\nMR. BOYNTON: Well, that's the argument.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the problem because here\nwe're dealing with the fee to be paid by the people who\nare plated in Michigan, and it looks like that $100 is the\nfee for them.\nWell, let me -- I have a question. I'm trying\nto test this. Suppose that I have a company in Maine.\nAll right? And I have -- I decide all my -- I -- I have\nall Maine plates, by the way. And I decide I want my --\nnow, let's -- one word is license plates. I'm going to\ntalk about plating. Another word is the ICC insurance.\nLet's call it a decal. And the third kind of a concept is\nwhatever you refer to in your statute by a fee. All\nright? The $100.\nMR. BOYNTON: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, suppose in\nMaine what I do with my trucks is I say I want Michigan to\nbe my home State for purposes of -- what do you call it?\nThe SS?\nMR. BOYNTON: SSRS.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. And so I go to Michigan,\nand now I pay all the registration fees here. Do I get a\n-- a certificate of some kind, a decal or something to\nshow I did it?\nMR. BOYNTON: No. Your Honor, I -- I -- you say\nthat you're a Maine company --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. BOYNTON: -- but your principal place of\nbusiness is in Michigan?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes. So -- that's right.\nMR. BOYNTON: Okay. And your question is?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do I get a decal after I go\nthrough all this procedure? You have a whole form. I pay\n$6 for Alabama. I pay $2 for Idaho, and -- but -- but I\ndo it all in one shopping place which happens to be\nMichigan.\nMR. BOYNTON: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then do I get a little\ncertificate to put on the truck to say I did it. I -- I\nregistered my ICC decal everywhere.\nMR. BOYNTON: If that vehicle -- if the vehicle\nyou're registering is plated in Michigan --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, it's not.\nMR. BOYNTON: Okay. You will pay nothing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know for Michigan. But I\nhave to pay. But Michigan is my -- I can't ask the\nquestion until I get clear on this.\nMR. BOYNTON: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Don't -- when I -- when I go\nunder this -- this 49 U.S.C. 14504 and I choose a home\nState --\nMR. BOYNTON: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and I make all the relevant\npayments to that State, but they distribute, don't I get a\npiece of paper saying I did it?\nMR. BOYNTON: I believe so, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Now, I'm now plated in\nMichigan, and I make Michigan my home State for this. And\nI go and I make -- I say, Michigan, I'm going to give you\nthis big check to distribute, but the amount I'm putting\nhere for Michigan, by the way, is zero. And you say pay\nme $100. No. I'm not going to do it. So I haven't paid\nthem the $100. I haven't paid Michigan everything, but I\npaid $2 for Idaho. Do I get the decal or don't I?\nMR. BOYNTON: To get a decal from Michigan, you\nhave to be Michigan-plated and you have to pay the $100.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Excellent. Now, if I don't get\nthe decal, because I didn't pay the $100, then that $100\nis a charge that falls within the SSI. It is a charge for\na decal which shows that I registered the ICC and my\ninsurance because otherwise, if it weren't, you'd give me\nthe decal.\nMR. BOYNTON: Your Honor, we believe that under\nthe -- the section 7 of the Michigan law, there is no fee\ncharged for your SSRS.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm talking about a fee. I'm\ntrying to -- oh, fine. If there's no fee charged and I\ndidn't pay the $100 and I didn't pay anything else, you'd\ngive me the decal. But you said you wouldn't.\nMR. BOYNTON: Your Honor, you have to -- you\nhave to -- if it's Michigan-plated, that's the triggering\nmechanism. It's not the -- that's -- that's what triggers\nthe $100 fee.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Boynton, may I just -- may\nI just ask this question? Is part of your position that\nthe Federal statute does not prevent Michigan from waiving\nthe $10 fee on -- for this particular purpose?\nMR. BOYNTON: Our position, with respect to\nthat, Your Honor, is the fact that under section 7 of the\nMichigan Motor Carrier Act, 478.7, Michigan has no\nauthority to charge a Michigan-plated vehicle any fee at\nall.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right. So that -- but you're\nsaying to Justice Breyer then is they have waived the $10\nand they do it to a narrow class, those vehicles who are\nplated in Michigan because they've already charged them\n$100, a very heavy charge for the privilege of being\nplated.\nMR. BOYNTON: Well, I don't know if I'm saying\nthat, Your Honor. I'm saying that the -- there's a zero\ncharge, and then there's -- there's another charge with\nrespect to a vehicle fee.\nThe one thing that I need to point out here is\nthat the SSRS is not vehicle-specific. It talks about\nnumbers of vehicles, but the Michigan decal fee for -- or\nthe interstate fee is vehicle-specific. You have to\nidentify the particular --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that right? Let me -- let\nme -- I wanted to ask this question to see whether it's\nvehicle-specific. Suppose I have nine trucks. They're\nMichigan-plated, so I have to pay $100 for each of the\nnine.\nMR. BOYNTON: Interstate commerce.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, suppose I -- suppose I\nonly pay the fee for eight of them. What happens?\nMR. BOYNTON: And how do you want to use the\ntruck? Do you want to use it in interstate commerce?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. I've paid for eight, but I\nhaven't paid for the ninth. As I read the Michigan law,\nit says shall not operate any motor vehicle upon or over\nthe highways of this State while any of the fees imposed\nby this act remain unpaid. Now, if -- if I can't operate\nthe other eight because I haven't paid for the nine, that\nsounds to me like a vehicle-specific tax.\nMR. BOYNTON: Yes, it is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean -- I mean the opposite.\nIt's -- it's not vehicle-specific.\nMR. BOYNTON: Oh.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I've paid for the eight, and I\ncan't operate at all because I haven't paid for the ninth.\nMR. BOYNTON: Well, I think administratively\nthat -- that wouldn't happen. I -- I think once you go --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me how it reads.\nAm I reading the law wrong? It says, shall not operate\nany motor vehicle while any of the fees imposed by this\nact remain unpaid.\nMR. BOYNTON: I suppose that if the -- for --\nfor nonpayment of fees, a motor carrier risks its\nauthority to operate in the State.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: At all. So it's not really\nvehicle-specific.\nMR. BOYNTON: Well, I -- I think it is. I would\ndisagree with Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the computation is\nvehicle-specific, but you're using all the vehicles as\nhostage for the payment of -- of any shortfall. That's\nwhat you're doing, isn't it?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it's carrier-based.\nMR. BOYNTON: Well, Your Honor, I would have to\ndisagree with Your Honor respectfully. I think that the\n-- that it is vehicle-specific because it identifies the\nparticular vehicle that's involved here. And I -- I think\nyou have to read the statute, the preemption statute, the\nscope of what preemption has sought to do here, and not\nall State fees and charges on motor carrier vehicles are\npreempted.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you place any reliance in\nthis scheme on the fact that the only people subject to it\nare people who have their principal place of business in\nMichigan?\nMR. BOYNTON: No, Your Honor. The triggering\nevent for the interstate fee is the plating of the vehicle\nin Michigan.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and anyone can choose to\ndo that? I mean, going back to Justice Breyer's example,\nanybody can say, well, I think I'd like to be plated in\nMichigan even though I operate in -- in other States. My\nprincipal place of business is in another State.\nMR. BOYNTON: Right. I think all parties have\nnoted, Your Honor, that the -- under the SSRS it's much\nmore stringent, more rigorous --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. I'm just asking about what\nyou do in Michigan.\nMR. BOYNTON: Yes. Yes, you can.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You really can do that?\nMR. BOYNTON: You can plate wherever you have\ncontacts with the State. If your principal place of\nbusiness is in Ohio but you have trucks going to and from\nMichigan, that -- that would allow you to plate in State\nof Michigan.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you can plate your whole\nfleet in Michigan under those circumstances.\nMR. BOYNTON: You could -- you can choose where\nto plate your feet -- plate your trucks, and a number of\nconsiderations go into that. It's not just the license\nplating fees. It has everything to do -- as we noted in\nour brief, it could have to do with no fault insurance,\nthe weight limits on trucks. It's an economic decision\nand there's a number of different factors that go into\nthat decision of where to plate a vehicle.\nIn conclusion, I would say that the Michigan\nCourt of Appeals correctly decided this case. And they --\nthey found that the challenged fees in these cases are\nregulatory fees, that they serve the critical function of\nprotecting the people of Michigan that use the highways.\nAnd the Michigan Court of Appeals should be affirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nBoynton.\nMr. Stewart, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS IN NO. 03-1230 AND\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 03-1234\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe United States as amicus curiae supports the\nState in American Trucking and the petitioner in Mid-Con.\nWith respect to American Trucking, in our view\nthe central question in resolving the constitutional issue\nis not whether it would be possible to apportion the\nintrastate fee on a more precise basis. The question is\nwhether the Constitution requires it.\nAnd in the prior cases that we've cited in our\nbrief, both the older cases dealing specifically with\nintrastate transportation and the more recent cases\ndealing with authority to engage in other intrastate\nbusinesses, this Court has repeatedly upheld the authority\nof States and municipalities to charge flat fees for the\nprivilege of engaging in the local business within the\njurisdiction during the -- the relevant period of time.\nAnd that practice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That seems to me really to\ngo back on -- on Scheiner. And I thought we tried to get\naway from deciding Commerce Clause questions on the basis\nof whether it is interstate commerce or local commerce,\nyou know, the original package doctrine and things that\nsucceeded it. And you're -- you're just dragging back in\nthis -- this inquiry into whether it's really interstate\nor -- or rather local.\nMR. STEWART: Well, with -- with respect, Your\nHonor, I think the Court has certainly abandoned the\nnotion that there is a bright, absolute line between\nintrastate activities which are subject to plenary\nregulation by the States without any Commerce Clause\ninquiry and interstate commerce which is wholly immune\nfrom State regulation. The Court has recognized that the\nquestion is more complicated than that.\nBut in cases like Jefferson Lines, for instance,\nthe Court held that the sales price of a ticket for an\ninterstate bus trip could be taxed in -- in its entirety\nby the State in which the ticket was purchased because the\nsale of the ticket was regarded as a separate, discrete\nevent properly severable from the underlying interstate\ntransaction.\nAnd the case for severance is all the more\npowerful here. That is, here we're dealing not with a --\nan aspect of an interstate transaction, we're dealing with\npoint-to-point hauls within the State of Michigan. It's\ntrue that those may be undertaken by trucks that also do\ninterstate business, and it's even true that in some\ninstances the intrastate load may be carried on the same\ntruck at the same time that it's also carrying goods\nbetween the States. But the intrastate haul is itself a\ndiscrete commercial transaction. To the shipper it's\nwholly irrelevant, in most instances, that the -- the\ntruck is also doing an interstate business.\nAnd to differentiate this case from Scheiner,\none of the things that the Court has looked at in the\ndormant Commerce Clause inquiry is the risk of multiple\ntaxation. And the Court doesn't just mean multiple\ntaxation in -- in the abstract because it's necessarily\ngoing to be the case that an entity that does business in\nmany States will be taxed in many States. Rather the\nquestion is whether there's an undue risk of multiple\ntaxation on the same transaction or the same conduct or\nthe same activity.\nAnd that was at real risk in Scheiner because if\nyou imagine a truck that's delivering cargo from Maine to\nFlorida and passing through several States on the way, and\nit's required to pay a fee that is, in essence, a fee for\nentering the State, has nothing to do with the mileage\ntraveled within the jurisdiction, it's entirely reasonable\nto say that the imposition of those cumulative trips --\ncumulative taxes for a single haul of goods from Maine to\nFlorida is an instance of multiple taxation of the same\nevent.\nHere we don't have a problem with that. The tax\nis being levied solely on point-to-point hauls within the\nState of Michigan. If a particular truck also makes\npoint-to-point hauls in some other State within the\ncalendar year, it may be subject to two taxes, but they\ncan't be characterized as two taxes on the same conduct or\nthe same transaction.\nThe second aspect of -- of Scheiner --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, it could. I mean, if --\nif this -- this truck is making one -- one haul, it's\ncarrying some goods from Texas to -- to Maine, but some\nother goods it picks up along the way within Tennessee and\njust carries it to another place within Tennessee, and\nthen it picks some other goods in New Jersey, carries it\nelsewhere to New Jersey, you're going to be taxed. It\nseems to me it's -- it's one trip.\nWe never used to -- used to divide railroads on\nthe basis of well, the ICC has jurisdiction over just the\ninterstate portions and -- and the two stops within a\nState can be regulated by the State.\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I think you're right that\nit wouldn't be reasonable to regard the within-Texas\nsegment or the within-Oklahoma segment of a transfer of\ngoods between States as a discrete, separable event. But\nif the truck is picking up goods at one point in Texas and\ndepositing them at another point in Texas, again from the\nshipper's point of view, that's clearly a discrete\ntransaction. The shipper is unlikely to have any interest\nin whether the same truck is simultaneously carrying goods\namong the States. And it's reasonable to regard that as a\ndiscrete event that is taxable by the State in which it\noccurs.\nThe other point to make about Scheiner is that\neven if we assume, as the petitioner argues, that the\naverage interstate truck that makes some point-to-point\nhauls within Michigan will do so less frequently than the\naverage truck that does business solely within that State,\nthere's still a whole different class of interstate\ntruckers that makes substantial use of Michigan's roads\nthat could be charged taxes on the basis of mileage\ntraveled and they're being let off the hook because the\nState has chosen to focus this tax on intrastate activity.\nPetitioners' response to this is that you can't\ndiscriminate against one class and then make up for it by\n-- by discriminating in favor of a different class.\nAnd if this were, to use title VII terminology,\na disparate treatment case, we would agree. That is, if a\nState overtly discriminates against one class of\ninterstate or out-of-state activities and on the face of\nthe law those people are treated less favorably, then we\nwould entirely agree that the State couldn't make up for\nit by giving more favorable treatment to a different class\nof out-of-state entities.\nBut here the petitioner is making what amounts\nto a disparate impact claim, and the essence of a\ndisparate impact claim is not that any particular\nindividual has suffered unfair treatment. The way you\nprove a disparate impact claim is to show the effect\ncumulatively upon the class, upon interstate truckers in\nthis case in the aggregate. And there's really no way to\nfeel any kind of confidence that interstate truckers won't\ndo better as a group by virtue of Michigan's decision to\nfocus this tax on intrastate activity rather than on the\nbasis of mileage, which would sweep in a lot of out-of-\nstate truckers that are not currently covered.\nI'd like to speak briefly at least about the --\nthe Mid-Con case. And in our view the best way of\nunderstanding -- to -- to return to the historical\nantecedents of the current SSRS provision, in its original\nform, as enacted in 1965, the statute said it's not an\nunreasonable burden of -- on interstate commerce to\nrequire an interstate carrier to register its Federal\ncertificate so along as you do so in accordance with the\nstandards of the ICC. If you go beyond those standards,\nit's an unreasonable burden on commerce.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'd like to know the text you\nrely on.\nMR. STEWART: That was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For -- for preemption, the text\nof the current statute that you rely on.\nMR. STEWART: The text of the current statute is\nset forth at page 82 of the appendix to the certiorari\npetition in Mid-Con, and it's now 49 U.S.C. 14504(b). And\nthe statute says, the first sentence, the requirement of a\nState that a motor carrier providing transportation\nsubject to jurisdiction under subchapter 1 of chapter 135\n-- and that refers to interstate transportation --\nproviding interstate transportation and providing\ntransportation in that State must register with the State\nis not an unreasonable burden on transportation referred\nto in section 13501.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 13501 deals just with SSRS.\nMR. STEWART: No. 13501 is the provision that\n-- that defines the general regulatory jurisdiction of the\nDepartment of Transportation and the Surface\nTransportation Board. And it basically says these\nagencies have general regulatory jurisdiction over\ntransportation between points in one State and points in\nanother State and -- or between points in the same State\npassing through another State. So in -- in using that\nshorthand reference, the Congress just means interstate\ntransportation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?\nBecause I know your time is short. Supposing Michigan\nimposed a new $10 fee per -- and it identified it\nprecisely as in order to comply with that statute and then\nreduced its present plating fee from $100 to $90, would\nthat be permissible?\nMR. STEWART: Well, as long as the -- again, to\n-- in our view the distinctive and disqualifying feature\nof the current statute is that subsection (2) is imposed\nspecifically on vehicles that operate entirely in\ninterstate commerce. And if Michigan reduced to $90 the\nextra --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not saying -- they reduced\nto $90 the plating fee, but then they enacted a new $10\nfee specifically designed to comply with the statute.\nMR. STEWART: As long as --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could they do that?\nMR. STEWART: As long as they were still\nimposing that additional -- again --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The $90 is for plating. It\nsaid only -- only Michigan-plated vehicles pay the $90.\nEverybody else -- everybody -- and everybody also pays the\n$10.\nMR. STEWART: As long as that $90 fee was\nimposed not just on Michigan-plated vehicles generally,\nbut specifically on Michigan-plated vehicles that operate\nentirely in interstate commerce, we would say that's\npreempted because our reading of the statute is that\nbasically Congress has said there's a severe limit on what\nyou can do to interstate carriers that you don't do to\nintrastate carriers.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where does it say that? Let --\nlet me come back to the -- to the section of the statute\nyou're quoting. You didn't finish the sentence. It says\nthat it's not an unreasonable burden when the State\nregistration is completed under standards of the Secretary\nunder subsection (c). Subsection (c) is entitled SSRS,\nSingle State Registration System.\nMR. STEWART: May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Briefly.\nMR. STEWART: The State doesn't argue that this\nregistration was completed in accordance with this\nstandard. It argues that the provision doesn't apply at\nall because this is not the sort of registration\nrequirement that the statute speaks of. We think it is\nbecause it's imposed strictly on interstate carriers.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nStewart.\nMr. Digges, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT DIGGES, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 03-1230\nMR. DIGGES: Thank you. I'd like to just\nbriefly cover three points.\nFirst, I believe that -- that is accurate to say\nthat the Solicitor General's position is returning us to\nthe pre-Complete Auto days of line-drawing, but more than\nthat, the Solicitor General's position is ignoring the\npractical effect of these fees on taxpayers. I think the\n-- the citation to the Peddler v. Drummer line of cases\nillustrates that.\nThe only difference between the Peddler cases\nand the Drummer cases was that in the -- in the Nippert\ncase and -- and the Drummer case, they looked at the\npractical effect on an out-of-state salesman and whether\nthat salesman would be discouraged by the $50 fee that was\nbeing imposed from coming into the State. In the Wagner\ncase, they simply said that the fee fell on an essentially\nlocal event, didn't look at the form of the fee, didn't\nlook at the form of the fee on the out-of-state salesman.\nI don't think it can be disputed that to out-of-state --\nthat out-of-state salesmen would be equally discouraged\nfrom coming into a State because a $50 fee or a $100 fee,\nwhether or not they're carrying the goods with them in at\nthat time or whether the goods are later mailed in.\nSo, again, I think it is returning to the line-\ndrawing issues, and really there is no test that is made as\nto, after you -- you draw these lines, what the appropriate\ntest should be.\nThe second point is it -- with respect to the\nadministrative practicality of apportioning these fees.\nThe purpose of apportionment would not be, as in a highway\ntax, to -- to show the amount of highway damage that was\ndone by a truck. The purpose of apportionment here is\nsimply to show the extent of the taxpayer's level of\nactivity in the State. It would be like a general revenue\ntax in which we're trying to allocate the taxpayer's\nactivity to particular States, make sure that that\ntaxpayer is paying its fair share of the State's costs\nwith respect -- of the State's generic costs, in this\ncase, generic regulatory costs. So, again, I think that\napportionment would be very easy.\nAs Justice Scalia said, the trucking industry is\nwilling to take the onus of this. We bill by the mile.\nYou could do it on number of loads. You could do it in a\nlot -- a lot of ways. And by apportioning the fee, you\neliminate the burden and you make the out-of-state\ncarrier, who would be otherwise prohibited from only\nhauling a load or two -- he would then have the ability to\nhaul that load and -- and not be discriminated against.\nThe final area I'd like to talk about a little\nbit is the need for additional -- the need for evidence in\nthis case. Again, in the Nippert and the Scheiner cases,\nthere -- they -- they -- it was expressly said that there\nwas no need for evidence in the cases because in the\ngeneral average of instances, the out-of-state trucker\nwill always pay more than the in-state trucker.\nAnd in answer to your question, Justice Stevens,\nI think it was recognized in those cases that there would\nbe some exceptions to that rule. There would be a few\nout-of-state carriers that would operate more heavily in\nthe State than in-state carriers. But that exception\nwasn't -- wasn't what was going to happen and the most\noften, and that the average of instances, it would always\nwork to the disadvantage of the out-of-state carriers.\nAnd -- and the final point is that with respect\nto evidence, you have here also a failure of internal\nconsistency test, and this Court has said a number of\ntimes that failure internal -- of internal consistency is\nnot a test related -- it doesn't rely on specific facts\nbut it relies on hypotheticals.\nAnd in this instance, I think there's a very\nclear failure of internal consistency. Like in Scheiner,\nthere's a cumulative burden on an out-of-state trucker.\nIf a trucker wants to operate in intrastate commerce\naround the country, it has to -- and just haul one load in\nevery State, it has to pay 48 times a $100 fee or pay\n$4,800 in eligible -- in order to be eligible to haul in\nall of those States. So that illustrates how that's going\nto balkanize commerce, that that carrier is not going to\nbe able to pay that kind of entrance fee nationwide. So\nthat carrier will operate in less intrastate activities in\n-- in only a few States or maybe none.\nAnd again, we think that that defeats the\npurpose. When Congress passed economic deregulation of\nthe trucking industry, that they wanted to open it up to\nout-of-state carriers to be able to augment their\ninterstate loads.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Digges.\nMR. DIGGES: Thank you.\n"
