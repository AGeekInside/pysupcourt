APCC Services, Inc.\nMr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nChief Judge Sentelle observed in his dissent\nbelow that there are assignments and there are\nassignments, and that's essentially going to be the\ntheme of my presentation this morning. It is I think\ncommon ground between the parties in this litigation\nthat if you have an assignment which represents the\ngrant of the entirety of both the right and the remedy,\nthat is the complete assignment of the chosen action,\nthen under those circumstances there's no question that\nthe assignee has standing under Article III.\nBy parity of receiving, if all that the\nassignee receives is a power of attorney, a mere\ncollection agency role, under those circumstances I\nthink it's common ground between the parties that\nArticle III is not satisfied. Two of the data points\ncome from --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Say it again? What is the\ncommon ground?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think the second part of\nthe common ground is that if all that the assignee\nreceives is the power of attorney, that is to serve as\nthe lawyer for the assignor, under those circumstances\nthe assignee doesn't -- cannot -- has no common stake\nthan I or my clients do in these particular cases, any\nmore than I do in my client's interest in these\nparticular cases, and there I don't think anybody\ndisputes that Article III is not satisfied.\nNow, the Court in Vermont Agency sort of\nidentified two additional data points. First of all, it\nmade clear that a 10 percent bounty by itself unattached\nto anything else is not sufficient, largely I think for\nthe same reasons why the lawyer's claim is insufficient,\nbecause that's not tied to the particular right at stake\nand therefore is inadequate to allow Article III to the\nsatisfied.\nThe second half of it is, though, that if\nthat bounty is coupled with an assignment of the rights\nand even if that's a partial assignment of the rights,\nthen there is Article III jurisdiction under those\ncircumstances.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if these\ncontracts provided that the aggregators will turn over\nall of the proceeds of the litigation except for one\npenny, then you'd be satisfied?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm not sure I'd be\nsatisfied. I think there's a different -- I think the\nanswer is that might satisfy Article III. The only\nreason I'm reluctant to say that that's the line that\nought to be drawn is because this Court's taxpayer\nstanding cases seems to recognize that there are\nsituations where there is a sufficiently de minimis\namount of at stake that under those circumstances\nArticle III won't be satisfied. But clearly the\ncleanest line to draw is in circumstances where have you\nno stake in the outcome that clearly is beyond what\nArticle III would ultimately do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well then, this is not\nreally a very significant case, is it? Because I\npresume that these enterprises that agglomerate claims\nand bring suit as a collection agency, they could simply\nget their compensation, instead of by way of, of a flat\nfee, by, you know, claiming entitlement to 2 percent of\nthe rewards. So it's no big deal, I mean, really.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But it is a big deal, not\nnecessarily because of the importance of the article. I\nthink the Article III part of it is still a big deal. I\nthink requiring as a separation of powers matter that\nthere has to be a concrete stake in the party bringing\nthe litigation, that's an important principle and the\nCourt shouldn't abandon it, and that's posed directly in\nthis case.\nBut more fundamentally in terms of the\nimportance of the underlying process, remember here\nwe're talking about an assignee who takes on 1400\ndifferent assignor claims involving 400,000 pay phones.\nAnd that's the problem, is that when you break this down\nand you allow just simple assignments to satisfy Article\nIII in its prudential standing concerns, then what you\nend up with is this mass tort litigation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it would be just the\nsame, Mr. Phillips, would it not, if the arrangement was\nthat the aggregator gets a piece of the action? Let's\ntake out the de minimis one cent. A significant stake,\nlike the qui tam plaintiff has. So you would have the\nsame problems that you're complaining about with regard\nto discovery from the individual PSPs, the same problem\nwith respect to counterclaim.\nThat's -- so it seems to me that, as Justice\nScalia suggested, this isn't about a whole lot if just\nby the device of giving the aggregator part of the, a\npiece of the action, this suit would be okay because the\nprudential objections that you are making here would\napply just as well.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, and I would -- I would\nstill assert those same prudential objections in the\nhypothetical you pose. What I'm saying is when you --\nwhen you have an assignment and there is a bounty built\ninto it, however you want to define the bounty, whether\nit's a penny or 10 percent or 2 percent or whatever,\nthat may satisfy Article III. I understand that. That\ndoes not answer the question of whether there's\nprudential standing under those circumstances. In that\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Go ahead, I'm sorry.\nMR. PHILLIPS: In that context, Justice\nGinsburg, you do have the problems. You don't get the\ndiscovery. You don't get to use the efficiency of the\ncounterclaim process, and there are serious questions\nabout whether or not there are res judicata and\ncollateral estoppel effects, and I would argue in that\ncontext that there's a very significant claim that those\nproceedings ought not to be entertained by a Federal\ncourt as a prudential matter, not as a matter of Article\nIII.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if all of the\nclaimants assign their claims to something called an\nagglomeration trust and the -- the person who's bringing\nsuit here brings it as a trustee? He has no interest in\nit personally and he is compensated the same way, the\nsame way this agglomerator is compensated. He has no\npersonal interest. He could sue, couldn't he?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean, there is a long\ntradition of allowing trustees to bring litigation on\nbehalf of the trust because that's the only way that a\ntrust can in fact enforce its rights.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So once again, it's no big\ndeal. I mean --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it is a big deal,\nbecause trust relationships carry all kinds of\nadditional legal consequences. What is particularly\noffensive about this arrangement, Your Honors, is that\nthe assignor gets all of the benefits of being able to\nbring mass tort litigation with none of the\nresponsibilities.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He would do the same thing\nin Justice Scalia's if it were an irrevocable trust.\nThe trust could do exactly what the aggregator is doing\nhere.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's true, but there are\nadditional trust responsibilities that would attach to\nthat process. There's an entire legal regime to deal\nwith that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- that might protect those\nwho assigned their interest to the trust, but I don't\noffhand see what difference it would make, what\ndifference those responsibilities would make vis a vis\nyou and your client.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, again, Justice Souter,\nI think the answer probably is going to depend on how\nthe Court interprets the prudential standing doctrine.\nAgain, I don't have any quarrel as an Article III\nmatter, because I think it's one of those long-held\ntraditions that trustees are allowed to bring litigation\non behalf of the trust and that's understood.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the real issue is not\nwhether the trustee can sue. The real issue is whether\nthe trust can sue.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. I mean, that's where\nthe claims are, sure.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It seems to me in his\nexample if the trust can sue, why can't the aggregator\nsue? And your answer was, well, trustees have certain\nresponsibilities. But I don't see that those\nresponsibilities inure to the benefit of your client or\nto an opposing party in litigation that a trust brings.\nSo I don't see how it would differentiate it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there are two\ndifferentiations. One is that there is this entire\nlegal regime that regulates trusts and that has allowed\nthe courts for 200 years, probably longer than that, to\nbe comfortable to allow litigation to proceed in a\nparticular way.\nBut second of all and the second answer to\nyour first question is the prudential concerns remain\njust, potentially just as serious. I think the question\nis do you want to create litigation devices that allow\nthe courts to avoid -- to allow lower courts or, more to\nthe point, allow plaintiffs to avoid the requirements\neither of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 or the\nassociational standing doctrine. Those are doctrines\nthat are designed to limit mass tort litigation in\nparticularized circumstances --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You mentioned discovery.\nI don't see why you can't get discovery against this\nwhole bunch of people.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because they're not a party\nto the litigation. I mean, you can get discovery --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Subpoenas out there and\ndepositions.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But, Justice Stevens, if you\nsue me, you hail me into court, you put me to the\nburdens of being a defendant in litigation, the least I\nought to get out of that is that I can turn to you and\nask you to admit certain facts, I can turn to you and\nask you to answer certain interrogatories, and I don't\nhave to go chasing you down, because you've already\nsubmitted yourself to the personal jurisdiction of that\ncourt.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, in this\nparticular situation you can do the same thing. You can\nfile requests for admissions or serve interrogatories.\nI don't understand why you can't do that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I can serve them on the\naggregator, but I cannot serve them on the party who in\nfact has the relevant information that I need. I have\nto use third party subpoena power.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I would assume the\naggregators have the relevant information.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry, Justice Stevens?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I would assume the\naggregator would have the relevant information.\nMR. PHILLIPS: In some instances it might or\nit might not. The problem is the aggregator has got to\nget the information.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But they have to -- they\nhave the burden of proof in the case and I assume they\nhave to investigate the facts and be prepared for\ntrial.\nMR. PHILLIPS: And that would help on the\naffirmative case that they have to put together, but it\ndoesn't help with respect to the counterclaims. The\nQwest amicus brief does a very nice job of explaining\nthat there are a lot of situations where the -- where\nthe payphone operators are overpaid and it's very\ndifficult -- first of all, and the aggregator has no\nidea or any incentive to find out any of that, any of\nthat information. And when Qwest made the requests of\nthe aggregator saying, provide me with the information,\nthe brief quotes in a variety of places comments such\nas, you know, \"whatever the -- our aggregator says is\nfine with us,\" or \"I don't care about those claims,\" or\nanswers like that, which, if I sue you -- I mean, if you\nsue me and I ask for those, you cannot give me back\nthose answers.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you can make that same\nanswer if it's just a standard assignee for collection\nof -- of a debt for single person.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but if it's a simple\nassignee for a debt and nothing more than that, just a\npower of attorney -- or are you talking about a full\nassignment?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. It's a full\nassignment, where everybody agrees that there's\nstanding.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But in no circumstance --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You can make the same\nargument: Oh, he might not have all the information.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but at least there he\nis also responsible for both -- he has the entirety of\nthe right. He has the right and the remedy. So that\nwhatever counterclaims you have operate directly against\nthat particular individual.\nBut even in that context, Justice Kennedy,\nit seems to me there's a fundamental difference, as a\nmatter of prudence, between dealing with a single\nassignee back and forth and the disputes that arise\nthere and the difficulty of discovery that would exist\nthere, and the situation we have here where you have\n1400 payphone operators --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You have a discovery be\nproblem. I don't see that it's a standing problem. And\ntwo things it reminds me of are, one very common, a\nfinancer takes an interest in receivables and he's going\nto have to collect them as receivables and there may be\n50,000. That could have the same kind of practical\nproblems. Or we had cases in the First Circuit you may\nor may not be aware of where somebody went around and\nhad assignments for 50,000 cabbages that were delivered\na day late in 50,000 box cars and each one was worth\nabout $10. Nobody figured a way out of that. They had\nto pass a special statute.\nThere was -- and so it seems to me you're\nbetter off than the cabbage people because have you two\npossible remedies: One on discovery; you could ask the\njudge, Judge, see what the Communications Commission\nthinks. It's called primary jurisdiction of the kind.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But, Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or you could go to the FCC\nand you say, FCC, you got us into this.\nNow, you have some rules here that make some\nsense in terms of collection. You have both those\nagency avenues open to you, not open to the cabbage\npeople, and this doesn't seem a standing problem. Now,\nwhat's your response to that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there are two elements\nof the standing problem: The first one is we're all --\nlet's be clear -- we're talking about a hypothetical\nthat's different from this case because we're talking\nabout a hypothetical where in fact the assignee has a\nconcrete interest in the outcome of this dispute. Here\nthe assignee has no interest in the outcome of this\ndispute. So the Article III problem arises there.\nThe question is if you have a minor amount\nat interest, even if it's, you know, concrete but\nnevertheless approaches de minimis, should you\nnevertheless entertain that case. And I think the\nanswer to your question, Justice Breyer, is that instead\nof making this into a Federal court case, where you have\n1400 claims like this, what the Court should say is that\nthe better course to follow is in fact for the\nplaintiffs to take their claims, if they want to, in an\naggregate form to the FCC because that's the right\ninstitution to deal with it because it doesn't have the\nlimitations of Article III and it doesn't have the\nlimitations of prudential standing to interfere with its\nability to provide complete relief.\nAnd, indeed, if you read the Respondents'\nbrief, they identify, as the prototype litigation, in\nwhich this entire system worked effectively, a claim\nthat was in fact litigated in front of the Federal\nCommunications Commission, not a case that was litigated\nin front of the Federal court. So, to my mind, the\nright answer to this case is to take these cases all to\nthe FCC, not as a matter of what we do as primary\njurisdiction, but simply as what the plaintiffs do\nbecause they don't have the vehicle to bring this to the\nFederal courts.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you do about --\nabout aggregated plaintiffs who are not in the field of\nFederal regulation? They're just sort of out of luck?\nCan they petition for the creation of an FCC that they\ncan take their claims to? I mean, this is a fluke that\nthere happens to be this Federal agency they could have\ngone to. Certainly our principles of standing should\nnot depend upon that fluke, should it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think when the Court\nis considering the questions of prudence, you know, it\ncan certainly take it into account, and maybe that would\nargue in the alternative in another case if there\nweren't such an available vehicle that the Court might\nbe more inclined to entertain it under those\ncircumstances.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would there be review?\nThe FCC, you pointed out, doesn't have Article III\nbarriers. So the FCC decides one way or another. One\nparty ends up losing. Is there review in Federal court?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean, Justice Ginsburg,\nthat is Spiller. That's what the Court said in Spiller,\nand I think it's a logical outgrowth of what the Court\nheld in ASARCO, which is that, even though a claim\ndoesn't start with Article III jurisdiction because it's\nnot an Article III entity, that when a final\ndetermination comes out of that entity that is in fact\nenforceable as a right that that right is enforceable\nconsistent with Article III notions. And that's true.\nThat is what the Court essentially, without dealing with\nArticle III at all, said in Spiller, and that's clearly\nwhat the Court held in ASARCO.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the advantage?\nYou have proposed the FCC route. That obviously wasn't\ntaken here. What is the advantage of going to Federal\ncourt on claims like this?\nMR. PHILLIPS: From my perspective or from\nthe plaintiffs' perspective.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would the plaintiff\nmake such a choice if the agency --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because the -- the plaintiffs\nhere, the payphone operators, get a free pass in this\nproceeding. They get all of the benefits of being able\nto go to Federal court and bring litigation with none of\nthe burdens of having to deal with discovery or\ncross-claims or counterclaims or even necessarily being\nbound by doctrines of res judicata and collateral\nestoppel. So you get all the benefits and none of the\ndisadvantages. That's why it's an advantage for them to\ngo to Federal court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How is that different?\nMR. PHILLIPS: When --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Just on that very point --\nI need clarification on this. How is that different\nthan the case of the financer who takes accounts\nreceivable, which is very common? You finance the\naccounts. You take a secured interest in accounts\nreceivable.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And there you might\nforeclose on the secured interests. Then you as the\nfinancer have to collect from everybody. How is your\ncase different from that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't know --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In the respect you were\njust talking about.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, I mean, the\nreal question is I don't know why that case is\nnecessarily in Federal court either. I mean, a lot of\nthat --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know, but I mean, there\nmay be many reasons for that. I'm just saying it's a\nnormal, practical problem, I believe, in the banking\ncommunity. I don't know.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but most of that's\nlitigated in State courts, in which case there's no\nserious problem --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Go back to my question, I'd\nlike to get an answer to it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Certainly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In respect to the problem\nyou were just mentioning, the discovery problem of\ncounterclaims or those problems, is this case any\ndifferent than the financing case I just mentioned?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think so.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think those exact problems\nwould arise in that context as well. On the other hand,\nthat's a situation that seems to me is largely driven by\nthe exigencies and by accident in Federal court. This\nis situation that is driven into Federal court by the\nplaintiffs' choice and by the ability and the preference\nto be in a position to get the benefits of litigation in\nFederal court without any of the detriments that might\notherwise arise in that context.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Could you explain that?\nThat really goes back to your answer in Justice\nGinsburg's question and I'm not getting it. She said\nwhy would you go to the Federal court if you can you go\nto the FCC, and you said, well, you get the benefits of\nbeing in Federal court. What -- I should be asking\nother counsel this question, but as you understand it\nwhat is the benefit of being in the Federal court rather\nthan the FCC that makes this so attractive?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I guess I would encourage you\nto ask counsel on the other side, because personally I\nwould think that they would have a full and fair remedy\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you don't know of any\nbenefits?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You don't know of any\nbenefits?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't know -- well, other\nthan the ones I've already articulated, where I think\nthey get some advantages of being in a Federal court and\nhave --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you eliminate step\none. I mean, you go to the FCC, you win there, then\nyou've got to face an appeal before the Federal courts.\nWhy not go right to the Federal courts immediately? You\neliminate one level of litigation.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, and that may well be\nhis answer.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I'd like you to go\nback to the question that Justice Stevens, Justice\nBreyer, and I asked you. You said, oh, there's a\nproblem, there's no counterclaim, we can't get the\ninformation. And we say, well, that happens in every\naccounts receivable assignment; there's no problem\nthere. And then you say, well, that should be in State\ncourt. That's not right.\nI thought it was agreed, stipulated by you\nat the outset, that if there's a standard assignment for\ncollection you can be in the Federal court; there is\nstanding.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, there is Article III.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And Article III.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. And let's not lose\nsight of that core question --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If you're saying, if you're\nsaying that it's the aggregation that makes it difficult\nto reach everybody, well, that's a question of\ndiscovery, and it's still the aggregator's\nresponsibility. If the aggregator can't answer\nnecessary questions for discovery of the suit, the\nsuit's dismissed.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, that may or may not\nhave happen. But let's be clear, okay. The core\nquestion here is whether or not an aggregator who has no\nclaim, who has no stake at all, not a penny's worth, can\npursue this litigation. On that it seems to me the\nanswer got -- should be no. There's no benefit to it.\nThe concrete stake is a core requirement of Article III\nand the Court ought to enforce it as a separation of\npowers question.\nThe issue that we've been discussing here is\nwhat do you do when you get past that, and when you have\na kind of a bounty that's been attached to it, and how\ndo you resolve that? In that situation, which is not\nthis case, I still think that there would be grounds for\nprudential standing to serve as a basis to eliminate\nthis kind of litigation. On the other hand, it may well\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I am sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said the aggregator\nhad -- that the aggregator could sue on behalf of these\n1400 plaintiffs naming every one of them as a named\nplaintiff in this complaint and still the aggregator\nwould run the show because they each authorized the\naggregator to conduct the litigation.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, it seems to me that\nit's not very prudential to require that there be 1400\nnamed plaintiffs instead of one.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, the price you\npay -- bless you -- is that when you bring Federal court\nlitigation -- is that you have to have -- you have to\nexpose yourself to exactly the burdens that come with\nit.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You also pay a price. I\nthought that's what you were going to get at. Talking\nabout prudential standing, 1400 filing fees is pretty\nprudential.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Federal courts\nclearly have an interest in that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought your\nposition was they could all join in one complaint just\nas long as they're all named separately.\nMR. PHILLIPS: They can join in a single\ncomplaint. You know, the court can consider whether or\nnot it thinks joinder is appropriate under those\ncircumstances, but they could unquestionably do that.\nBut then, again, they are then at that point a plaintiff\nin the litigation having brought this action and,\ntherefore, subject to all of the burdens of being a\nplaintiff in the litigation, including submitting\nthemselves to the personal jurisdiction of the court.\nI mean, let's be clear about this. There\nare 1400 names out of people all over the country that\nunder the -- under the plaintiffs aggregators' theory we\nhave to go chase down in order to obtain discovery, to\nobtain any of our counterclaims or anything like that.\nWhereas if they come into this Court and they submit\nthemselves to the jurisdiction, at least the process\nworks as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't like to be\nthe broken record. I'm just not getting -- I don't see\nwhy that isn't the responsibility of the plaintiff. The\ndistrict court said, now, you've brought these claims.\nThe defendants need this information. You go get that.\nThat's your responsibility.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't doubt that the\ntrial court can do that, but the question is: Why do we\nhave to go to the burden of having to chase all of that\nin the first instance?\nI mean, the Respondent's brief at page 10\ncriticizes us for not having brought 1400 third-party\ncomplaints, not having sought additional discovery. All\nof those are burdens that simply arise in this context\nthat otherwise do not exist in an ordinary case where\nyou simply ask the party who has the actual claim to be\nthe plaintiff in front of the court.\nAnd that's -- and, again, just to be clear,\nwe are still here dealing with the hypothetical. We're\nnot dealing with the core question of what do you do\nwith a plaintiff who has not one penny at stake in\nlitigation that, as the lawyers describe, is all hard\ncash.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm sorry. The only way,\nit seems to me, that you can eliminate what you regard\nas a problem is by having 1400 separate actions, so that\nin any given case if you want discovery, your plaintiff,\nthe person who has got to provide that discovery, is\nstanding right there.\nAnd I don't see how you can get the benefits\nthat you are claiming entitled to without having 1400\nseparate actions. If you don't have 1400 separate\nactions, whether you have an aggregation like this,\nwhether you have a joint action, whether you have a\nclass action, this problem of chasing down, as you\ndescribe it, is going to be there.\nSo it seems to me the prudential question\nfor this Court is: Do we really want to require 1400\nseparate actions so that you can have your perfect\nparadigm of private litigation? And to say, yes, we\nwant 1400 actions, it seems to me is a stretch. What do\nyou say?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think the answer to that is\nthat when you -- when you deal with mass tort\nlitigation, the Rules of Civil Procedure ought to apply\nin that context as it applies in every other place. And\nwhen the courts deviate from the standard paradigm for\nlitigation, they do it expressly, either through the\nrules or through doctrines that already exist.\nAnd so we have Rule 23, which sets out very\nclear protections for both the courts -- or not only for\nthe courts, but for the plaintiffs and for the absent\ndefendants -- absent, absent plaintiffs and for the\ndefendants, and is a clear mechanism for conducting 1400\nclaims all once in a particular situation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What does that have to do\nwith -- I guess that goes to prudential standing.\nMR. PHILLIPS: It goes directly --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It has nothing to do with\nArticle III standing.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, to be sure. Again, I\ndon't think that -- I mean, the Article III debate here\nseems to me to turn solely on the question of there is\nno stake in the outcome of this case. That's a bedrock\nrequirement of Article III and ought to be a basis for\nsimply reversing. But, you know, to the extent that the\nCourt then goes beyond that and worries about what's the\nnext case going to look like and what are the prudential\nlimitations, which I don't think the Court has to\nresolve any of this, what I would suggest is the Court\nshould be informed by Rule 23 and associational standing\nand those doctrines --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Are you saying, in effect,\nthat if we get to the prudential-standing point, the\nanswer is that in the absence of a rule comparable to\nRule 23 we should not recognize prudential standing, but\nthat if we adopted a rule that sort of regulated how\nthis would work, prudential standing would be\nappropriate? Is that basically it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think that's the right\nanswer, is that the Court shouldn't just make it up as\nit goes along. And if there is a need for this -- look,\nand the truth is we've been here 200 years. We haven't\nhad to have aggregator standing all of this time. It\nstrikes me that there's no compelling need for a change\nand that for that reason the Court ought to go back to\nthe paradigm example, plaintiffs sue defendants and you\nhave normal discovery and counterclaims.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any significance\nto this being the -- this assignment transfers legal\ntitle. True, there's an obligation to pay, to pay the\nseparate PSPs. But does anything turn on legal title?\nFor example, suppose the -- I gather the check would be\npayable to the aggregator if the aggregator prevails.\nCould a creditor of the aggregator come in and say,\nstop, you owe me lots of money and I want to reach those\nproceeds?\nMR. PHILLIPS: That -- I mean the proceeds\n-- I assume -- do those claims arise out of the\nrelationship between the payphone operators and the\naggregator?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No.\nMR. PHILLIPS: It's completely unrelated to\nthat? It's just a garnishment on it?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: These are just the\ncreditors. Or the aggregator goes bankrupt.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I assume those moneys could\nbe taken out of the aggregator and then the PSP would\nhave a claim over against the aggregator for breach of\ncontract.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Phillips.\nMr. Englert.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. ENGLERT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nOne of the last things Mr. Phillips said was\nthere's no need to change the law in this case and I\nstrongly agree with that. Assignees for collection have\nbeen litigating in Federal courts since at least the\n19th century and there is not one decision cited in any\nof the briefs in this case in which an assignee's\nlawsuit was dismissed solely because of what the\nassignee intended to do with the proceeds.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But also not one in which\nthe issue of standing was raised and decided. And our\njurisprudence says that where we do not address the\nissue of standing the case has no precedential value on\nthe subject.\nMR. ENGLERT: Justice Scalia, a single\ndecision, a small body of decisions that don't address\nthe issue of standing, can be looked at in that way.\nBut a unanimous body of case law, two decisions from\nthis Court, arguably a third decision from this Court,\nmany decisions from lower courts -- JUSTICE\nSCALIA: I don't consider two decisions an enormous\nbody.\nMR. ENGLERT: But there is an enormous body\nin the lower courts under Rule 17.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we don't count the\nlower courts.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Englert, with respect\nto what weight we should give to those decisions, I just\nwant to put a simple hypo and I'll ask a question on it.\nAssume that in this case the assignment -- well, assume\nanother case, rather, in which the assignment is\nidentical is identical to this one, except that the\nterms of the second agreement, i.e., if I the aggregator\ncollect anything I give it to you. Assume that is part\nof the first agreement, so that there is an assignment\nand as part of the assigning document there is a stated\nobligation on the part of the assignee to pay all\nproceeds to the assignor.\nI am assuming that your position would be\nthe same; is that correct?\nMR. ENGLERT: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Now, my question is, you're\ntaking that position, I think, just as you did in\nresponse to Justice Scalia, on the grounds that there is\na huge body of law that assignment for collection\nconveys adequate standing. But are any of the\nassignment for collection cases in that body of law\nclearly cases like the one in my hypothetical in which\nthe assignment itself by its terms requires the total\npayment of any benefit back to the assignor?\nMR. ENGLERT: Justice Souter, the cases\ndon't always discuss the way in which the assignment\narose. But typically, in those cases they simply say,\nthere are these two promises, and they say the fact that\nthere is a second promise makes no difference. That's\nmy position. The fact that there's a second promise,\nwhether in the same document or in a different document,\nmakes no difference.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's the earliest of\nthose cases in our Court?\nMR. ENGLERT: The earliest case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The earliest case in our\nCourt that upholds this that, without specifically\naddressing the standing issue, gives judgment?\nMR. ENGLERT: The earliest case that gives\njudgment is Spiller in 1920.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 1920?\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In Vermont Agency, in the\nVermont Agency case, which dealt with qui tam, that many\npeople, including the Justice Department, thought did\nnot confer Article III standing, we held to the contrary\nthat it did confer Article III standing, mainly because\nit had been around forever. It was -- it was the\nunderstood part of the judicial power when the\nConstitution was adopted.\nDo you have any case prior to 1920 in which\nEnglish courts or even early American courts thought\nthat this, that this would be sufficient to bring a\nlawsuit?\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, assignee standing, not\nassignee for collection standing but assignee standing,\nis referred to in Blackstone's Commentaries\ncontemporaneously with the Constitution.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure, but --\nMR. ENGLERT: This wrinkle of arguing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's more than a wrinkle.\nThe assignee keeps the money.\nMR. ENGLERT: But the wrinkle of arguing\nthat that makes a difference as far as I know first\narose in the 19th century. And every single case and\nevery single Federal court that has considered the\nquestion under any body of law has rejected the\nargument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's the earliest Federal\ncourt case you have?\nMR. ENGLERT: Late 18th -- late 19th\ncentury.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Late 19th century?\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're not under any\nbody of law. I didn't see any cases cited after we had\nmore carefully explicated our understanding of Article\nIII. What's the latest case from this Court that you've\ngot?\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, as you know, I argue\nthat the Vermont Agency case strongly supports us. But\nif you want a case specifically about assigning\ncollection, then the latest case I have is Titus in\n1939.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, aren't Titus and\nSpiller different in that there the assignee is suing on\na judgment that was obtained in a forum where Article\nIII didn't apply?\nMR. ENGLERT: No, absolutely not, Justice\nAlito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why isn't that irrelevant?\nMR. ENGLERT: Because for the exact reason\nMr. Phillips gave you. The ASARCO case and Coleman v.\nMiller, Justice Frankfurter's concurring opinion, and a\nnumber of other cases stand for the proposition that a\nparty who invokes the jurisdiction of this Court or of\nany other Federal court must satisfy Article III. So\nwhen Spiller, the secretary of the Cattleman's\nAssociation, went to the Federal district court seeking\nenforcement of the reparations award he had gotten\nbefore the ICC, he had to satisfy Article III.\nWhen Titus came to this Court arguing that\nthe lower courts had not properly given full faith and\ncredit, he had to satisfy Article III. Each of those\nparties invoking the jurisdiction of the Federal court\nwas someone who had to turn over 100 percent of the\nproceeds to the assignors. And in each case this Court\nrejected the argument that he was not a proper\nplaintiff.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you say in\nyour brief that there is no reason for concern about the\nabsence of concrete adverseness. But I would have\nthought there was a great deal of reason for concern and\nthat your client doesn't care if he wins or loses.\nMR. ENGLERT: My client --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's all the same to\nhim. If he wins, he doesn't get to keep the money; if\nhe loses, he loses.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, that's -- that's false\nin every possible respect, Your Honor. He does keep --\nget to keep some of the money. Now, we haven't proved\nthat in the lower court. It's an allegation at this\npoint, but it happens to be true. But aside from\nthat --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the\nquestion came to us on the assumption that he doesn't\nretain any of the money.\nMR. ENGLERT: On the assumption, but not the\nfact.\nSecond, my client's whole reason for\nexistence is to collect payphone compensation. This is\nwhat my client does day in and day out.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought our\ncases made clear that that kind of -- -- I forget what\nwe call it -- it's a separate interest from the injury\nthat you're alleging in the lawsuit. You don't allege\nin the lawsuit that the basis for Article III injury is\nthat you're in this line of work and if the work dries\nup you're in big trouble. That wouldn't be enough to\nsupport Article III standing.\nMR. ENGLERT: No. What's enough to support\nArticle III standing is the interest of the assignors,\nas the Court held in Vermont Agency.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but then why\nis the assignee bringing the lawsuit?\nMR. ENGLERT: The assignee --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He had no\nindependent injury.\nMR. ENGLERT: The assignee is bringing the\nlawsuit for the most pragmatic of all possible reasons.\nMr. Phillips wanted to talk a lot about discovery, and\nJustice Kennedy and I believe Justice Souter asked why\nis this lawsuit in Federal court instead of before the\nFCC. There are good answers to those questions.\nThe discovery in Federal court, the\ndiscovery available in Federal court, is more\nappropriate to -- is more necessary in a large case, a\n$200 million case like this one, than in a relatively\nsmall case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, we got\noff the track here.\nMR. ENGLERT: We did.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm trying to find\nout what the assignee's injury is.\nMR. ENGLERT: The -- the assignee's\ninjury --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And how it's\nredressed by the receipt of the money.\nMR. ENGLERT: It is, as this Court said in\nVermont Agency, the assignor's injury and it is\nredressed by --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. But you know,\nVermont Agency, obviously, the assignee recovers\nsomething himself, that he gets to keep the bounty.\nHere that's not the case.\nMR. ENGLERT: Here that's not the case, but\nthe reasoning of Vermont Agency specifically rejected\nthe proposition that the bounty was helpful to the\nassignee's standing. And there is not a word in Vermont\nAgency that says when you combine the bounty with the\nassignor's interest that's enough. It just says the\nassignor's interest is enough, full stop, because of the\nancient doctrine.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought it said -- I\nthought it said, Mr. Englert, that, that the United\nStates has -- is treated as having assigned part of its\nclaim for damages to the qui tam relator, and that gave\nthe qui tam plaintiff a stake in the action, a stake in\nthe proceeds. I thought that Vermont Agency -- and\nJustice Scalia will correct me if I'm wrong -- was\nenvisioning the kind of assignment that Judge Sentelle\nwas talking about when he said there are assignments and\nthen there are assignments.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I was under the same\nmisimpression, I have to say, and I wrote it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ENGLERT: The -- the assignment in this\ncase conveys all right, title and interest. It conveys\nit for purposes of collection to be sure, but it conveys\nall right, title and interest.\nNow, the proposition that the \"for purposes\nof collection\" purpose of an assignment negates the\nability of the plaintiffs to sue is one that has been\nlitigated many times in Federal courts, and that\nargument has been rejected in every case in which it's\ncome up until now, including two from this Court. So\nbetween the fact that the reasoning of Vermont Agency,\nwhatever the facts were, relied on the interest of the\nassignor, relied on the ancient doctrine that the\nassignee for Article III purposes stands in the\nassignor's shoes, and the fact that this argument has\nbeen rejected in every case in which it's come up, I\nthink the case for Article III standing is quite strong\nhere.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I must say we seem to have\ncome full circle from Flash v. Cohen, which said that\nthe doctrine of standing had nothing whatever to do with\nArticle III. That it all -- the only thing it's there\nfor is to assure that concrete adverseness on which our\nadversary system depends. You've come full circle from\nthat to now your argument that concrete adverseness\ndoesn't matter at all.\nMR. ENGLERT: Oh, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there a combination of\nthe two that's possible, that maybe one of the elements\nof Article III standing is that both parties have a\nstake in winning and losing?\nMR. ENGLERT: There is tremendous concrete\nadverseness in this case. And both parties have a great\nstake in winning and losing. The -- the aggregator\ndoesn't get to keep the money, although actually it\ndoes, but this case can be decided on the assumption,\nsubject to remand that it doesn't get to keep the money.\nBut it exists for the purpose of bringing -- of\nobtaining redress from carriers obtaining payphone\ncompensation from carriers, usually outside the\nlitigation process. But this is -- but this is what my\nclient does -- what my clients do.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Sierra Club\nprotect -- undertakes activities to protect the\nenvironment, but that doesn't give it standing in every\nenvironmental case to sue. It needs to show members\nwhat the concrete interest and so on. The fact that\nyour client is in the business of suing on behalf of\npayphone operators --\nMR. ENGLERT: My client is not in the\nbusiness of suing on the business of payphone operators.\nMy client is in the business of collecting, usually\noutside the litigation process. This is merely an\nextension of the day-to-day operation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me is this\n1,400 causes of action or is it one?\nMR. ENGLERT: One.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How does that come about?\nSuppose a lot of people owe the bank -- a lot of farmers\nowe the bank money, can there be assignment in this one\ncause of action?\nMR. ENGLERT: Sure. And let me give you\none --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And how does the law\nexpress the metaphysical process in which 1,400 causes\nof action become one cause of action?\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, they are all assigned to\none entity that brings the cause of action just as a\ntrustee brings causes of action --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there is not a\nrepresentative cause of action. What is the magic point\nat which it becomes one cause of action?\nMR. ENGLERT: The point at which they are\nall assigned to one entity that then brings the cause of\naction, and importantly, has authority to settle the\ncause of action without any further permission from the\nclients. The -- a very, very important protection here\nfor Mr. Phillips --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm still missing\nsomething here. Can you give me an example of where\nthis has happened in other cases that this Court has\nheard that are commonly heard?\nMR. ENGLERT: Every Rule 23 class action,\nevery associational standing case, every trustee action.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I interrupted you and I\ntalked over you. Every Rule 23 cause of action and what\nelse?\nMR. ENGLERT: Every associational standing\ncase, every action brought by a trustee.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, associational\nstanding, Sierra Club v. Morton, they are interested in\nan ongoing injury in which there is a common -- in which\nthere is a common injury. These are liquidated amounts.\nMR. ENGLERT: But that's not uncommon, Your\nHonor. Justice Souter's opinion for the Court in United\nFood and Commercial Workers v. Brown reported a Seventh\nCircuit case that said representative damages litigation\nis common from class actions under Rule 23 to suits by\ntrustees representing hundreds of creditors in\nbankruptcy, to parent patriot actions by State\ngovernments to litigation by and against executors at\ndecedent's estates. This is something that happens\nevery day in Federal court.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Those are usually ongoing\ninjuries as to which there's a common interest in\nstopping the injury. Here you're aggregating liquidated\namounts.\nMR. ENGLERT: It's actually not entirely\nliquidated amounts. There are ongoing disputes about\nongoing payphone compensation. But I don't think it\nwould make any difference even if that weren't true.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I might understand it if\nwas some sort of injunction actions -- in the future\nplease pay what you're supposed to pay.\nMR. ENGLERT: No. But, Justice Kennedy,\nconsider the typical Rule 23 damages action, which is\nabout amounts due in the ordinary case. You have one\ncause of action on behalf of the class instead of many\ncauses of action on behalf of many people. It happens\nall the time.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's allowed because\nthe requisites for class actions have been met and\nthat's authorized by the rule. That's not true here.\nMR. ENGLERT: Because we have something much\nbetter here. What we have here, Justice Kennedy, is\nassignments of the cause of actions by every plaintiff\nto my clients completely --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There are a lot of better\nprocedures that are in the rules but it is not in the\nrule.\nMR. ENGLERT: Actually there is. Rule 17\nwas put in the rules. And if you read the works of\nJudge Charles Park, you will see that Rule 17 was put in\nthe rules to authorize justice kind of action to be\nbrought in the name of assignees, including asignees for\ncollection. And one year after he joined the Federal --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a fact question?\nI'm just a little puzzled here. I probably should have\nasked Mr. Phillips. But what issues in fact are there\ngoing to be in this case? It seems to me everything\nought to be on computer somewhere, and it's just a\nmatter of pushing the right button and you know how much\nmoney you owe. Am I missing something?\nMR. ENGLERT: You're not missing something,\nJustice Stevens. That's what this case is about, is\ncomputer records, massive computer records in possession\nof the carriers and some tools the aggregators have to\nanalyze computer records.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except for counterclaims.\nHe says I have some counterclaims.\nMR. ENGLERT: He says he has some\ncounterclaims, but in nine years of litigation his\nclients have never used Rule 19; they have never used\nRule 22; they have never made any effort -- he says we\nhave asserted they have to go out and bring 1,400\nseparate lawsuits. What we said on page 10 of our brief\nwas they have never tried in nine years of of litigation\nto use --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what did they do?\nI mean, you mention necessary parties but these other --\non your own theory the PSPs are not necessary parties,\nand this -- this is a defendant seeking to join\nadditional plaintiffs, and that's rather odd. And you\nalso talk about interpleader. I don't know who is the\nstakeholder in this picture.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor, my point is\nthat there are many procedural devices available to deal\nwith many situations like this, Rule 19 and Rule 22 and\nseparate lawsuits. If there were serious counterclaims\nin this case, first of all as a factual matter, AT&T and\nSprint would know it from their own records and second,\nthey would have done something in nine years to try to\nbring a claim against PSP, and they have done nothing in\nnine years. So this is a very, very odd case in which\nto be worrying about whether they have lost some\ncounterclaim rights because the PSPs -- lost some\ncounterclaim rights because the PSPs aren't individual\nparties.\nIt's also a very odd case in which to be\nworrying about discovery rights because the PSPs aren't\nindividual parties because that issue was resolved in\ntheir favor in 2000 by the special master's discovery\norder saying, just as Justice Stevens postulated, the\naggregator to go out and get the information from the\nPSPs.\nNow they complained that some of the PSPs,\nsome of these mom and pop operations, said we don't have\nany information. That's because for the most part the\nPSP don't have any information. The information resides\nwith the carriers and with the aggregators. So as a\npurely practical, pragmatic matter this is not the case\nin which to be worrying that some discovery rights have\nbeen lost; this is not the case in which to be worrying\nin which some counterclaim rights have been lost; this\nis not the case in which to be worrying that my clients\naren't' bound. Every single -- I'm sorry, that the PSPs\naren't bound, the assignors aren't bound, because every\nsingle one of them has signed an agreement, or two\nagreements, really, saying they will be bound. What\nthis comes down to is a series of abstractions put up\nagainst the tradition of allowing lawsuits by assignee\nfor collection.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well I guess it could be\nthat you're asking them to go back into records that are\nsomewhat old. What you're asking to find out is -- is\nevery call made out of a payphone that was long distance\ncall, and we don't even know who actually turned out to\nbe the carrier. It's like asking them, tell us exactly\non the payphone at that corner over there who was called\nat 9:15 a.m. to some number in 1987, and maybe they\nshould have records of that but they don't. They have\nestimates --\nMR. ENGLERT: No, they do. There is no --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They say maybe the time\nnecessary to go through those records, to figure out\nwhether you should give 12 cents to the person who ran\nthat payphone, is really not worth it.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And therefore, if they are\nright in some claim like that, is there a way to get\nthis worked out at the FCC? I mean, it -- it -- I don't\nthink it was the purpose of this statute to have 12 cent\nclaims, even aggravated, brought back years later under\nsome set of procedural rule that will be so expensive to\nget the discovery that this just won't be worth it.\nNow that might be right. And if it is right\nor whether it's right, can the FCC work this out?\nMR. ENGLERT: Your Honor, several points if\nI may. 47 U.S.C. in section 276 says that payphone\nservice providers are to be compensated for each and\nevery payphone call. So it was Congress's purpose to\nmake any 24 cent call compensable, and the FCC set up a\nvery elaborate system to make them keep records.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm aware of that system.\nI'm aware of that.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, as -- and there is about\n$200 million at stake in this case so this is not about\neach 24-cent payphone call individually. This is a\nproperly advocated case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. But my question is\nto get to that figure there may be billions of calls,\nfor all I know.\nMR. ENGLERT: There are.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it could be quite\nexpensive to track down each of those calls\nindividually. I don't know if it is or not; but if it\nis, is there a way to get this problem worked out at the\nFCC or do we have the cabbage case grown large?\nMR. ENGLERT: Your Honor, my client has\nbrought scores of these actions -- my clients have\nbrought scores of these actions, some before the FCC,\nthe largest ones -- and this is the largest one of\nall -- in Federal court to get the advantage of the\ndiscovery processes in Federal court. Most of these\ncases settle. These cases as Justice Stevens pointed\nout are about analyzing computer records, and you can\nfight to the death or you can say let's figure out who\nowes whom what and let's settle; and most of the cases\nsettle. There is no reason why there should be any more\nor less incentive to settle when the case is before the\nFCC than when it's before a Federal court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In settlement they may work\nout. But if it is -- for example costs a dollar to\nfight a claim that's worth 12 cents, individually,\nbefore you get to billions, they don't want to be in\nthat situation where they are really paying money for\nnothing; because in their opinion they already paid.\nI mean we understand this kind of problem.\nSo I go back to my question. They have one view of it;\nyou have another of what's going on here. And their\nview is very unfavorable to your clients and your\nclients' view is very unfavorable to their clients. So\nI would like to know is there a way to get this worked\nout at the FCC? Maybe that will turn out not to be\nrelevant in this case but I'd still like to know your\nopinion.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, this case was brought in\nFederal court under a statute that permits the\nplaintiffs to choose whether to go to Federal Supreme\nCourt or the FCC. The reason it's nine years old is not\nbecause we didn't sue immediately; it's because we've\nbeen litigating for nine years about our right to\nlitigate.\nDoes the FCC have a useful role to play in\nthis process at this point? Never say never, but I\ndon't see one. The case was brought in Federal court\nunder a doctrine that has always allowed assignees for\ncollection to sue in Federal court, and there is no\nreason I can think of why it shouldn't proceed in\nFederal court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Englert, is this one\nlawsuit or 1,400 lawsuits, or however many clients you\nhave?\nMR. ENGLERT: It's one lawsuit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How can it be -- how is it\none lawsuit when there are, I mean, just a lot of\ndifferent individual claims? You think you could have\nbrought this as a class action?\nMR. ENGLERT: We, after Judge Sentelle\ndismissed this case, we moved to the alternative to\namend our complaint to add either 1,400 individual\nplaintiffs or a class action. The plaintiffs opposed\nthat, and then she reversed herself on --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They opposed it on what\nseems to be a reasonable ground, that each of these\nclaims is quite different. There are different calls,\ndifferent -- different amounts owing. Each case is not\ngoing to be judged on the same -- on the same facts.\nMR. ENGLERT: That's really not true,\nJustice Scalia. Just it's a pure practical matter,\nleaving aside theory, this is about analyzing computer\ndatabases. This is about analyzing call records.\nBecause of the system the FCC set up, none of the\ninformation resides with the PSPs; it resides with the\naggregators and with the carriers.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree that this\ncould not have been brought as a class action?\nMR. ENGLERT: No, I disagree, Justice\nKennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why didn't you bring it as\na class action?\nMR. ENGLERT: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then why didn't you bring\nit as a class action? We can all go home.\nMR. ENGLERT: Because it's so much better to\nbring it on behalf of individuals who have expressly\nconsented to be bound, than on behalf of people who may\nnot even know about it and who may not have consented to\nbe bound and may not want to be bound as in the typical\nclass action.\nThere are all sorts of problems with class\nactions. Class actions are typically brought by\nenterprising law firms who may not ever have met their\nclients. This is a different litigation altogether.\nThis is litigation by a trade association that exists to\ncollect payphone compensation, doing the same thing it\nalways does, only doing it in court on behalf of 1,400\ncompanies that each signed an agreement saying I want\nyou to go do this for me and I agree to be bound by the\nresult. So I can get entitlement interest.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you -- this is giving me\na thought here. Just a total imaginary case, nothing to\ndo with your clients. Put yourself in the opposite\nposition. Suppose you were representing a defendant and\nthat defendant were asked by this imaginary plaintiff to\ndig up records on the computer. To dig up each\nindividual record costs $1, there were billions of such\nrecords, and the value to you, to the other side, the\nplaintiff, imaginary in this case, was 12 cents a call.\nOkay? So you say look, those people are asking us to\ndig up billions of records, it's going to cost us a\ndollar each to do it, and all they are going to get out\nof it is 12 cents a call. But of course we are the ones\nwho have to pay the dollar, and they get the 12 cents.\nNow, is there a way for the legal system to solve that\nproblem?\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Other than standing.\nMR. ENGLERT: Push the parties to settle.\nThat's what rational economics --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the defendant says --\nnow your client, I am not going to settle; there are no\nsuch claims. This is ridiculous but it's going to cost\nme a dollar to prove it.\nMR. ENGLERT: Yeah, the client says millions\nfor defense, but not one cent -- one cent for tribute\nand every lawyer gets happy, because the client wants to\nlitigate to the death instead of just surrendering to\nextortion, in that kind of case they have to decide\nwhether the economically rational thing is to set a bad\nprecedent or is to settle.\nThat happens all the day for defense counsel\nand I'm quite often defense counsel --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Speaking -- speaking\n--\nMR. ENGLERT -- but this case is not of that\nnature.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Speaking of one cent\nfor tribute, it's easy to get rid of this problem, isn't\nit?\nMR. ENGLERT: Prospectively.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't your\nagreements just say you get to keep $10 out of every sum\nthat your recover? Then we wouldn't have this problem.\nMR. ENGLERT: I agree, and we made that\npoint in our brief in opposition to cert. This case is\nof no practical significance going forward for the body\nof the law. There's nothing this Court is going to\ndecide in this case that's going to make a difference.\nPeople will just draft their assignment and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why --\nMR. ENGLERT: So my clients --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why doesn't the tie\ngo to Article III? I mean if it makes no difference\neither way I'd like to preserve significance of Article\nIII as a limit on court jurisdiction.\nMR. ENGLERT: Article III is a proper and\nimportant limit on court jurisdiction when it restricts\ncourt jurisdiction. When we have a traditional cause of\naction, the abstractions that have come to be thought of\nas Article III jurisprudence don't trump tradition.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but --\nMR. ENGLERT: What Article III --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Article III\ndoes trump tradition. I mean, if it doesn't meet\nArticle III, no amount of tradition can save it. And\nyou several times refer, when asked one of these\nquestions, to the tradition and the old cases, but I\nhaven't heard an answer yet to the concrete injury that\nis suffered by the aggregators.\nMR. ENGLERT: The -- on the assumption on\nwhich this case comes to the Court, the aggregators'\ninjury is the assigned injury of the assignors. We are\ntaking the principle of Vermont Agency and saying that\napplies just as much to assignees for collection as it\ndoes to any other assignees. Contrary to Mr. Phillips'\nposition and Judge Sentelle's position, that there are\nassignments and then there are assignments, the law has\nlooked many times at the question whether there are\nassignments and then there are assignments. The\nargument that assignees for collection should be treated\ndifferently has been made many times. It has never\nprevailed in Federal court, unless and until it prevails\nin this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The significance --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Englert, could you --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- to the legal title,\nwould it make a difference if the assignee did not have\nlegal title, was just --\nMR. ENGLERT: Oh, it would make a huge\ndifference, Justice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- but is that just a\nformality? For example, the question I asked\nMr. Phillips. Could a creditor of the aggregator get at\nthis money when the check is paid by AT&T and Sprint and\ntherefore reduce the amount available to distribute to\nthe PSPCs?\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, if we assume insolvency\nand we assume a secured creditor, then, yes, I think the\nPSPs are general unsecured creditors, and the secured\ncreditor is in line ahead of them. Different facts,\ndifferent results. But, yes, it does make a difference\nif the assignee enters insolvency, which is not going to\nhappen in this case, but if the assignee enters\ninsolvency and if there is a creditor that arguably\nunder insolvency principles has a higher claim than the\nPSPs, yes, it does make a difference to the assignee.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about for tax\npurposes? Must the aggregator report the proceeds as\nincome?\nMR. ENGLERT: Your Honor, I'm sorry. I just\ndon't know the answer to that question. I'm guessing\nthey either don't report them as income or they report\nthem as income, but then have a deduction in the exact\nsame amount. But I really don't know the exact answer\nto that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Englert, can you\nexplain to me again how it is that when you acquire 14\nseparate choses in action, 14 separate claims, against\nthe same defendant, just by your acquiring them they\nsort of melt into one cause of action. How does that --\nhow does that happen?\nMR. ENGLERT: That happens the same way it\nhappens under Rule 23. It happens the same way it\nhappens with the trustee who is representing people who\nwould otherwise have many different causes of action.\nIt's a very common thing in Federal court. If the -- if\na bankruptcy trustee or if a class representative brings\na lawsuit on behalf of many people, then there is one\ncause of action instead of the many causes of action\nthere would be if those many people sued directly. It's\nnot an issue.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In all of those\ncases, the class action, the trustee, you know, the\nnamed plaintiff, the named trustee has concrete injury\nand redressability to themselves?\nMR. ENGLERT: No more than my clients.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Very much more than\nyour clients. The trustee has legal obligations that he\nhas to discharge. If it's a suit that he has to bring\non behalf of the beneficiaries and doesn't do it, he is\nsued for breach of trust. In a class action case, the\nrepresentative has to have standing, has to show\nconcrete injury and redressability. Here we don't have\nany of that.\nMR. ENGLERT: I respectfully disagree, Your\nHonor. My clients have legal obligations that they have\nto discharge. They are embodied in the very agreements\nreproduced in the back of the red brief, that require us\nto pursue this action and require us to turn over --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But why do we have Rule 23\nthat requires certification of a class action? If you\ncan say, well, I don't need Rule 23, I'm going to take\n1400 claims and make them one any way.\nMR. ENGLERT: For very good reasons. Rule\n23 exists to protect absent plaintiffs, something we\ndon't have here, and to protect defendants so that they\nwill know there will be a res judicata effect of the\njudgment, whether for them or against them, so that they\ncan't be sued by other class members.\nThey have those protections. In fact, if\nyou read the blue and yellow briefs in this case, they\nkeep referring in the abstract to the protections of\nRule 23, but they don't identify a single concrete\nprotection that they do not have under this system.\nRule 23 is inferior to an action by assignees for\ncollection in every imaginable way. It's not a superior\nalternative. And to say that the existence of Rule 23\nmeans we should throw out a traditional form of action\nthat's been recognized for well over a century would be\na very surprising result.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Englert.\nThree minutes, Mr. Phillips. You might\nstart by the point your friend just made. What is the\nprotection that Rule 23 provides that you don't have?\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe specific protection is that the courts\ndetermine how the settlements will play out. They make\nsure that all of the requirements of Rule 23 are\nsatisfied before the litigation goes forward. That\nmeans that there is a demonstration of commonality, that\nthere -- the predominance issue is resolved, that this\nis a matter that should be litigated in this forum\nbecause it is a more efficient mechanism for litigating\nit, not because the assignor -- assignee decided that\nthis is more efficient way from the assignee's\nperspective --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And are problems --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- to litigate the issue.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are the requirements of\ntypicality and -- the same type of injury designed in\npart to preserve the rights of the defendant?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, of course, because you\ndon't want to have all this litigation being heaped on a\nparticular defendant under these circumstances. There\nis an efficiency to this process that the rules\nanticipate. And I think you're absolutely right,\nJustice Kennedy. There is simply no reason in the world\nto say we're going to allow this to be as a substitute\nfor existing doctrines under either Rule 23 --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't you --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- or associational standing.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose this had been\nmounted as a class action. I take it you would oppose\ncertification.\nMR. PHILLIPS: To be sure, and my answer is\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And one of the reasons\nwould be that these are all different situations,\ndifferent amounts involved in each case? Some -- you\nwould have a counterclaim, not others. I assume you\nwould say they're not a lot alike. Not at all alike.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg.\nWe would oppose it. I don't think that this is a proper\ncase for class certification. But it seems to me that\nthat doesn't mean okay, and, therefore, the answer to\nthis is: Come up with some other contrivance in order\nto litigate this in a way that obviously maximizes the\nconvenience to one side without regard to the\nprotections that are designed both for the defendant and\nfor the court that's embodied in Rule 23.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, do you\nattach any significance to the fact that every member of\nthe so-called class here has individually agreed to be\nbound by the judgment?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it's interesting\nbecause they -- in one -- in the assignment part of it\nthey say they are bound, but on the -- on the separate\nset of the agreement it talks about the reasonable\ndiscretion of the assignor -- assignee. So the\nagreement is, to my mind, inherently contradictory as to\nwhat are the obligations.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which -- the assignees,\nbut the assignors have agreed to be bound --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, if it's reasonable --\nit says reasonable discretion. And so the question is,\nyou know, is this -- was that an exercise of reasonable\ndiscretion? And I don't know the answer to that in any\ngiven case.\nAnd I think part of the -- Justice Kennedy\nand Justice Breyer, you asked the question about above\nand beyond discovery, what are the other problems that\narise when you go down this -- and the more -- the other\none is that being bound by the judgment.\nIf you have a complete assignment of the\nchosen action, the assignee, then, is completely bound.\nThere is nothing left. The assignor has no rights left.\nThere is nothing left for the assignor to do in that\nsituation; whereas, in these kinds of situations where\nthe assignee receives the right to go forward but the\nremedy is in another party's hands, the potential for\nbeing bound is completely lost.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
