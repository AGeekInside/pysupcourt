UNTEREINER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn 2003, this Court, to all appearances,\nbrought this case to an end by holding that all of\npredicate RICO counts found by the jury must be reversed,\nthat the liability judgment must be reversed, and that the\ninjunction must be vacated. On remand, however, a panel\nof the Seventh Circuit found a way to keep this case\nalive. It held that 4 of the 121 RICO predicates\nsomehow survived this Court's decision, and it strongly\nsuggested that the Hobbs Act punishes acts or threats of\nphysical violence that have no connection to either\nrobbery or extortion.\nToday, we are asking this Court to reverse the\nerroneous decision below and remand with very explicit\ninstructions that judgment be entered in favor of\nPetitioners.\nReversal is warranted because of three separate\nlegal errors made by the Seventh Circuit. First, the\nlower court failed to obey the clear holdings and remand\ninstructions of this Court. Second, the Seventh Circuit\nerroneously held, in conflict with two other Circuits,\nthat the Hobbs Act plausibly can be read to cover\nfreestanding acts or threats of physical violence. And,\nthird, the Seventh Circuit erred in its previous decision,\nin 2001, in holding that the racketeering law, RICO,\nauthorizes private injunctive relief.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Counsel, if we were to agree\nwith you on any one of the three questions, would that end\nthe case?\nMR. UNTEREINER: That's correct, Justice\nO'Connor. Because of what the Seventh Circuit also said,\nthat a new trial is not in the cards and the damages\nverdict is gone and nothing more remains to be done except\nfor the two issues that it outlined, that's correct. If\nthe Court rules in our favor on any issue, the case is\nover.\nLet me turn to our first point. The Seventh\nCircuit's decision is inconsistent with this Court's\nprevious holdings. This Court's 2003 opinion left no\ndoubt that, quote, \"all,\" unquote, of the RICO predicates\nmust be reversed. But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but there was a theory\nthat was put to the jury -- and it's right there on the\nspecial interrogatories -- one category was violent acts\nthat obstruct commerce with no connection at all to\nextortion. That was there. And I have a question about\nyour characterization of what the Seventh Circuit did. It\nwas puzzled. It says, \"Extortion, they all go.\" But here\nare these four that don't involve extortion, and there's\nno ruling from the Court on those. Was the Court supposed\nto assume that the Court made a question -- decided a\nquestion of statutory interpretation by silence?\nMR. UNTEREINER: No. No, Justice Ginsburg, but\nthe argument was made in this Court, at the petition stage\nthe last time around, that those four counts were, in\nfact, included in the petitions. At that time, of course,\nthere was no contrary authority. The Yankowski opinion of\nthe Ninth Circuit made clear, and I think the language of\nthe Hobbs Act makes clear, that freestanding acts or\nthreats of violence are not covered. So, we argued, at\nthe petition stage, that those counts were covered. And\nthen, at the merits stage, the Petitioners asked this\nCourt to reverse and remand for entry of judgment in our\nfavor on all claims and all counts. The Respondents, at\nthat point, did not argue --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Was there any argument on the\nmerits as to those four counts?\nMR. UNTEREINER: No, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. Yes. Is it conceivable\nthat we overlooked that point?\nMR. UNTEREINER: Well, we take the Court to mean\nwhat it -- what it says.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if I just -- do you think\nit's conceivable that we just didn't realize those four\npoints were at issue?\nMR. UNTEREINER: I think it's possible. But if\nthe Court did overlook those, I think that would have been\nsomething that should have been raised in a rehearing\npetition in this Court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And do you think we resolved\nthe statutory construction issue that you're now arguing\nvery carefully at this time?\nMR. UNTEREINER: There's no indication, in the\ncourt's opinion, that it resolved it. It may have assumed\nthat we were right, because we made the argument at the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They may assume it --\nMR. UNTEREINER: -- petition stage --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- but there's nothing in the\nopinion to give any --\nMR. UNTEREINER: That's correct. That's\ncorrect, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: If it's possible, at least,\nthat we just overlooked that aspect in the issuance of our\nopinion, would it be more helpful to move on to the other\ntwo questions at issue here, since they would be\ndeterminative? It's --\nMR. UNTEREINER: I'd be happy to --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- it's disturbing to think\nthat some court below deliberately was trying to defy what\nthis Court said. And I'm not sure there is any indication\nof that. It may have thought that those issues -- those\nother acts were overlooked, and, therefore, they had some\nright to deal with it. But I wonder if we shouldn't focus\non the other two legal issues here.\nMR. UNTEREINER: I'd be happy to move on,\nJustice O'Connor, to those two issues.\nOur second argument is that the Hobbs Act does\nnot punish freestanding acts or threats of violence. By\n\"freestanding,\" we mean unconnected to either robbery or\nextortion. And I think that's apparent from the language\nof the Hobbs Act, which has three clauses. And the third\nclause covers acts or threats of violence, quote, \"in\nfurtherance of any plan or purpose to do anything in\nviolation of this section,\" unquote. So, there needs to\nbe a connection. There needs to be a violation of this\nsection. And our position is that that refers back to the\nprincipal offenses under section 1951, robbery or\nextortion.\nNow, the Respondent's position is that the mere\nact of obstructing commerce, or affecting commerce, or, I\nsuppose, even delaying commerce, is a violation of the\nHobbs Act. And I don't think it's possible to read the\nstatutory language that way. So, we think that argument\nis clearly foreclosed. Now, if there's any doubt about\nthat, based on the language of the Hobbs Act, as amended\nin 1948, one need only look back to the 1946 version of\nthe Hobbs Act, as originally passed. And there, it --\nthere's no debate that Congress intended to cover acts or\nthreats of physical violence only if undertaken in\nfurtherance of a plan or purpose to commit robbery or\nextortion.\nSo, Respondent's position rises or falls on the\nproposition that in 1948, when Congress recodified and\nrevised all of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, it dramatically\nexpanded the Hobbs Act. This Court, in reviewing revision\nand recodification statutes, applies special rules of\nconstruction. It requires a clear statement -- or clear\nexpression of intent to make a substantive change; and, if\nthere isn't one, it assumes that no substantive change was\nintended.\nIf you look at the revisor's notes to section\n1951(a) in the 1948 revision, it's clear that there is no\nintent to make any substantive change. So, I think the\nCourt really doesn't need to go any further on that second\nissue to rule in the Petitioner's favor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The question is whether the\nCourt should rule on it, as in a matter of first decision.\nWe are a Court of review. There was no determination of\nwhether the Hobbs Act included such a category in the\nSeventh Circuit. So, the difficulty, the impediment to\naddressing your position is that however strong it may be,\nit wasn't resolved below, so why shouldn't we follow the\nnatural order that first the District Court speaks, and\nthen the Court of Appeals, and then it comes here?\nMR. UNTEREINER: Justice Ginsburg, I understand\nthe concern, but the Seventh Circuit did everything but\nresolve the issue. It said it wasn't resolving the issue,\nbut it -- at the same time, it said that it rejected our\nargument based on the rule of lenity. It rejected our\nargument based on the over-federalization of State crimes.\nIt said that both -- it rejected our plain-language\nargument. It went on and on to reject all the same\narguments we're making in this Court.\nSo, I think if the case were remanded to the\nDistrict Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. How could the --\nhow could the Court of Appeals not have resolved this\nissue? How could it possibly have rendered its judgment\nwithout resolving this issue?\nMR. UNTEREINER: Well, what the -- what the\nCourt --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did you raise this issue below?\nMR. UNTEREINER: Yes, we did, Your Honor. We\nraised it both in the -- at the rehearing petitions in the\nSeventh Circuit and in the initial appeal. It did resolve\nthe issue, insofar as it held that the Hobbs Act may\nplausibly be read to cover freestanding acts for threats\nof violence. And that holding is in conflict with the\ndecision of the Ninth Circuit and the Sixth Circuit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Is that how we\napply statutes, that if they may plausibly be read a\ncertain way, that's what they mean?\nMR. UNTEREINER: Well, that is what the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand how that's a\nresolution of the question.\nMR. UNTEREINER: The Seventh Circuit went out of\nits way to say it was not finally resolving the question.\nBut, Justice Scalia, it, again and again, went through\nour arguments and rejected them. And then, at the end of\nits opinion, it said it would be better to read the\nstatute at -- take the statute at face value, and that, it\nsuggested, was what Respondent's position was. So, I think\nit went as far as it possibly could to resolve the\nquestion and reject all of the arguments that are being\nmade here. So, I think it -- to go back to the District\nCourt, it would be a foregone conclusion, and it would\njust result in further delay. This case has gone on for\nalmost --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm with you --\nMR. UNTEREINER: -- 20 years.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- up to the point where you\nsay it went as far as it possibly could. As Justice\nScalia indicates, why didn't it say, \"This is the way the\nAct must be interpreted,\" period? So, it didn't go as far\nas -- I'm just quibbling with your -- I'm just quibbling\nwith your statement that it went as far as it possibly\ncould. I don't think it did. That's the problem.\nMR. UNTEREINER: Well, yes, it did leave open\nthe possibility that a court might come to the opposite\nconclusion. But I think if you're the District Court\nreading the opinion of the Seventh Circuit, I think it's\nclear which way you're going to have to come out.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We got you off of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Were you --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We got you off of your first\npoint, but I'd like to just loop back to that for a\nminute, at this point. Is this imprecision, this\nambiguity, grounds for our reading -- our insisting on\nreading our earlier remand and judgment literally and\nsaying that there are no predicate acts -- there are no\npredicate acts that support this judgment?\nMR. UNTEREINER: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do -- is there some prudential\nargument for us not to reach this issue and just insist on\nthe wording of our earlier mandate?\nMR. UNTEREINER: The Court could certainly come\nout that way on prudential grounds as a reason to avoid\ndeciding a Hobbs Act issue. But, in our view, the Hobbs\nAct question is a fairly easy and straightforward one.\nAnd the Seventh Circuit's opinion is going to create\nmischief if left untouched.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm concerned about your\ncharacterization, not only of suggesting that there was\nsome attempt to force a particular decision, but I'm\nreading the Seventh Circuit's remand to the District\nCourt. It went through your argument, which it said was a\nsubstantial one, that no change was intended in the\ncodification. And it said, \"While these revisions were\nintended to be formal stylistic changes, it is not beyond\nthe realm of the possible that the revisers may have made\ncertain substantive changes.\" That doesn't sound like\nthey were ruling on it definitively, but they were tipping\ntheir hand. \"Not beyond the realm of the possible.\" That\nwas --\nMR. UNTEREINER: The Seventh Circuit did\neverything it could to make it seem like a plausible\nissue, as opposed to a very clear issue that should be\nresolved in our favor. It went out of its way to do that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand how they --\nhow they could dispose of the case without resolving that.\nThat's my puzzlement.\nMR. UNTEREINER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How -- I mean, can we do that\nin a case that comes up here, and just say, \"There are\ngood arguments on both sides, it's quite plausible,\" and\nremand the case without resolving the issue?\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They asked the District Court\nto resolve it. They said the District Court should\nresolve it in the first instance, and then they would\nreview it, presumably.\nMR. UNTEREINER: That's right, Justice Ginsburg.\nBut I do think a premise of the remand for further\nproceedings in the District Court is that it's plausible\nto read the statute this way. And I think the Court\ncould, and should, reverse that aspect of the Seventh\nCircuit's decision.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, the reason they\nsaid it was plausible is that -- and you may well be\nright, on the bottom line, and the Government agrees with\nyou, but there are -- there's a redundancy in the statute.\nThere's a phrase in there that could be taken out, and\nthe statute would have exactly the same meaning, if you're\ncorrect.\nMR. UNTEREINER: We don't agree that there --\nwell, perhaps Your Honor could elucidate --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me those words --\nI forget what the -- \"commit threats of physical\nviolence.\" So, take those words. The statute will have\nthe same meaning.\nMR. UNTEREINER: I don't think that's right. I\ndon't think that's right --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, really?\nMR. UNTEREINER: -- Justice Stevens. I think\nthat that does add something. The argument is being made\nin this case that those words are superfluous under our\nreading, but I don't think that's correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What function do they perform?\nWhat case would it cover that would not otherwise be\ncovered?\nMR. UNTEREINER: It would cover preparatory acts\nof violence that do not rise to an attempt. We gave\nseveral examples --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That do not rise to an\nobtaining?\nMR. UNTEREINER: No, do not rise to an attempt,\nan attempted extortion or robbery. The example we gave --\nwe gave several examples in our blue brief. One of them\nis a defendant who wants to rob a factory and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, I see what you're saying.\nMR. UNTEREINER: -- and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're -- I understand.\nMR. UNTEREINER: Yes. Yes.\nIf I may, I'd like to turn, in my limited time,\nto the third question, which is the -- whether RICO\nauthorizes private injunctive relief. And we want to make\nthree basic -- or I'd like to make three basic --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, we didn't reach\nthat, last time.\nMR. UNTEREINER: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why, if we -- if we\nagree with you on the Hobbs Act, I assume you would not\nhave us reach that third question this time, either.\nMR. UNTEREINER: That's correct, there would be\nno need for the Court to reach that issue this time,\neither.\nBut I'd like to just say a few words about that\nprovision, because I think we're right on that issue, as\nwell. And the Court can pick any one of these three\ngrounds to rule in our favor. We'd be happy with any of\nthem.\nOur principal argument on RICO is that RICO's\ncivil-remedies provisions were drawn from the antitrust\nlaws, from the Clayton Act and from the Sherman Act before\nit. In fact, the treble-damages provision of RICO is\ntaken almost verbatim from the Clayton Act and Sherman Act\nprovisions. This Court, in a long line of cases, held\nthat the Sherman Act does not authorize private injunctive\nrelief. And that holding -- those holdings were based on\nthe provisions on which these RICO remedial provisions\nwere modeled. And so, we think when Congress took that\nlanguage, which is essentially identical, at least in the\n-- in the -- in the treble-damages provision, from the\nantitrust laws, that it was entitled to assume that they\nwould be read the same way in RICO.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, of course, at the time\nthey did that, the Clayton Act had already been passed.\nMR. UNTEREINER: That's true, Justice Stevens.\nBut I think those provisions were carried forward, and\nCongress -- and this Court's cases, again and again, have\nrelied on Congress's use of the -- of the Clayton and\nSherman Act models. You've said that's a dominant strand\nin the legislative history.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your argument's a little\ninconsistent with the Franklin case, though.\nMR. UNTEREINER: I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Gwinnett -- Franklin\nversus Gwinnett County.\nMR. UNTEREINER: Mr. Chief Justice, we think\nthat Franklin is distinguishable. There are two lines of\nthis Court's cases. Franklin falls into one line. That's\na case where this Court finds a -- or acknowledges a\nprivate right of action, but where, necessarily, there's\nno guidance from Congress of what the remedies are. And\nin that situation, the Court does apply a presumption that\nall available remedies are -- will be -- will be imputed.\nIn this -- in the second line of cases, which is\nwhat this case is all about, Congress sets forth a\ndetailed remedial scheme. And in those cases, I think\nit's inappropriate -- and this Court has said that\nrepeatedly -- for courts to add remedies to those schemes\nwhich Congress is -- has selected. Now, this is\nespecially true in this case, because Congress relied on\nthose antitrust precursors. And, beyond that, section 16\nof the Clayton Act, which expressly authorizes private\ninjunctive relief, is -- has no analog in RICO. Now,\nCongress thought about including a provision like section\n16 of the Clayton Act when it considered RICO. Again and\nagain, proposals were made, but Congress did not adopt\nthose proposals either during the consideration of RICO or\nshortly thereafter.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like to\nreserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMs. Blatt.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIt is the position of the United States that the\nphysical-violence clause of the Hobbs Act requires an\nintended robbery or extortion, and that private parties,\nunder RICO, cannot obtain injunctive relief.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you not --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would you tell us what --\nwhich one of these questions, in your view, we ought to\naddress, first and foremost? If the answer to any of them\nis favorable to Petitioner's position, I guess that's the\nend of the case.\nMS. BLATT: That's right. We think what would\nbe appropriate is to recognize that the -- this Court's\ndecision last time around did contain a sweeping statement\nat the end that all the predicate acts must be reversed.\nAt the same time, the issue of the physical-violence\nclause was not briefed by the parties, it was not\ndiscussed in this Court's opinion, it was not discussed in\nthe Seventh Circuit's opinion. And \"law of the case\" type\nprinciples are discretionary, and this Court has the\ndiscretion to reach the two other issues in the case.\nNow, the RICO issue is more squarely presented,\nbecause there's an actual holding by the Seventh Circuit\non that point. It's also an issue on which the Circuits\nare divided. It's important and recurring, and it's been\nbefore this Court twice. At the same time, the Court also\nhas discretion to clean up, or clarify, the Hobbs Act\nissue. There was a remand. And although there's no\nholding by the Seventh Circuit, there was a remand that\nwas predicated and based on an assumption that the\nplaintiffs had raised at least a substantial question.\nAnd this Court has discretion to say that was an error of\nlaw, because, under the plain language, the physical-\nviolence clause is linked to robbery or extortion. That's\nplain on the statute, because it requires that the\nphysical violence be in furtherance of a violation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though two U.S.\nattorneys, years back, did predicate cases on there being\na discrete crime of obstructing commerce through violent\nmeans.\nMS. BLATT: That's correct. And those\nprosecutions were inconsistent with the written guidance\nof the Department of Justice in a longstanding\ninterpretation of the Hobbs Act, at least since 1965, that\nit required an intended robbery or extortion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Blatt --\nMS. BLATT: And --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- can I identify a concern?\nI'd like you to help me out on it. I -- that language, if\nyou construe it the way the other side does, it would\ncover certain violent conspiracies that would merely\nobstruct interstate commerce that we could all be\nconcerned about today. Are there other criminal statutes\non the book that fill that gap?\nMS. BLATT: Yes. 18 U.S.C. 2332(b), subsection\n(g), is a laundry list of Federal statutes, and it's a\ngood source of reference for the type of Federal statutes\nthat cover violence where there's a distinct Federal\ninterest.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So that you're saying, in\nsubstance, that you don't need to read the Hobbs Act the\nway they do in order to protect the public from the kind\nof harms that the -- they would read the statute as\ncovering.\nMS. BLATT: That's correct. There's a lot of\nstatutes on the books that apply to bombing in public\nplaces, violence against communication facilities,\ncomputer, transportation, energy, airports, any kind of\nmass transportation. And that -- 18 USC 2332 -- it's a\nlong list of statutes. There's also the arson statute and\nthe bombing statute, the use of any explosives in a -- in\na -- in a facility that's used in interstate commerce.\nAnd the Government has brought thousands and\nthousands and thousands of Hobbs Act prosecutions, and,\nbut for those two, the only two that we can identify, all\nof our prosecutions have been linked to robbery or\nextortion.\nAnd if I could address the superfluous point, we\ndon't think the clause is superfluous either, for two\nreasons. It applies to a defendant who injures innocent\nbystanders during a robbery. Now, the defendant has\ncommitted the crime of robbery, but he's also committed\nthe separate crime of using violence against any person in\nfurtherance of that robbery. So, there could be\ncumulative punishment based on that offense, and there\nwould be --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What do you mean? It's a\nseparate --\nMS. BLATT: -- two separate offenses.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- a separate offense?\nMS. BLATT: It's a separate offense for --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you charge two counts for\nviolating the same section?\nMS. BLATT: Yes, because there's two distinct\nharms. There's not only the business, as the victim of\nthe robbery, but there's the innocent bystanders who were\ninjured or killed during the course of that robbery, and\nthat would be two separate -- and then there's another way\nit's not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Two separate violations, each\nof which violates the same statute?\nMS. BLATT: Yes, that's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it -- you just -- on your\nlist, I had the impression, but tell me if I'm right or\nwrong, that there's a specific statute dealing with\nabortion clinics now, though there wasn't when this case\nbegan.\nMS. BLATT: Yes, the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that if --\nMS. BLATT: -- FACE Act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- Operation Rescue did the\nsame kind of thing now that they did then, the Petitioners\nin -- the plaintiffs in this case would be able to get\nrelief under that statute. Is that right or wrong?\nMS. BLATT: That's absolutely correct. The FACE\nAct, which was passed in 1994, gives private parties a\nright for damages and injunctive relief for blocking\naccess to clinics. That would -- that would cover this\nspecific case, and then there's the more general statutes\nI was speaking about earlier. But there is a specific\nright to injunctive relief, and I think the plaintiffs in\nthis case tried to add claims under the FACE Act, but they\nwere -- they were denied the ability to do that.\nThe second way it's not superfluous is the\nexample given by Petitioners, in that it applies to a\ndefendant, for instance, who tries to enlist another\nperson in a robbery, but the neighbor, or the -- excuse\nme, that person just refuses. The physical-violence\nclause would apply to that situation regardless of whether\nthat conduct also qualifies as an attempt.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blatt, your time is\nalmost over, so, on the injunction part, what remedies are\navailable to the United States under your reading of the\nprovision? Injunctive relief, yes. What about -- is\nthere any monetary relief that the United States can seek\nunder RICO?\nMS. BLATT: Well, 1964(a) addresses equitable\nrelief, and the Government can get things like\ndisgorgement under (a). But as far as damages are\nconcerned --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMS. BLATT: -- no. This Court held, in the\nCooper case, which is an antitrust case that was talked\nabout in the Flamingo decision recently, the United States\nis not a person who is able to sue under the antitrust\nlaws, because -- the general background principle that the\nUnited States is not a person. And we think it's highly\nrelevant that, after this Court repeatedly held that\nprivate parties cannot get injunctive relief, that the\nUnited States cannot get damages under the antitrust laws,\nCongress, in the Clayton Act, passed two express\nprovisions: a Government damages action -- that was in\n1955, and now it's a treble-damages action -- as well as\nan express private injunctive action. And, thus, there\nwas this menu of remedies in the antitrust laws of express\nGovernment equitable, express Government damages, express\nprivate treble damages, and then Government damages. But\nCongress, in RICO, only picked up two of them. It picked\nup an express, a right for the attorney general to seek\ninjunctive relief and other equitable relief, and it\npicked up an express right for private parties only to\nseek treble damages.\nIn light of the holding after holding after\nholding, we identified six cases that were -- that were\nrendered before the passage of RICO, and the Cooper\ndecision, which said the Government cannot seek damages.\nWe think it's very clear that when Congress borrowed from\nthe antitrust laws, but did not pick up those two express\nrights, that the governing principle is that when Congress\nborrows a statute that's been definitively construed,\nCongress adopts that judicial construction along with the\nstatute. And it's particularly relevant because of those\ntwo express provisions.\nAnd RICO is -- just contains that structure that\nwas there in the Sherman Act, with the express public\nequitable action and the express private treble-damages\naction.\nIf there are no questions, we'd ask the Court to,\nif it wants, to reach --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have -- just have one\nquestion. If we were to adopt the Petitioner's first\nsuggestion that we should simply have a strict reading of\nour mandate, would that cause problems, so far as people\ninterpreting our precedent and indicating that, by\nimplication, we've reached this Hobbs Act question?\nMS. BLATT: No, I don't think so. I think in\nthe -- I don't think so. The Court could apply just\nstraightforward \"law of the case\" principles and say,\n\"Regardless of whether we actually reached the four\npredicate acts, our judgment spoke clearly that the\ninjunction had to be vacated.\"\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Regardless of whether we knew\nwhat we were doing, we said it.\n[Laughter.]\nMS. BLATT: And that's why we think it's\nappropriate for the Court to say, just like the Court did\nin the recent per curiam Eberhart, that generally courts\nare supposed to follow this Court's mandates, and they're\nsupposed to articulate their concerns to facilitate\nresolution by this Court, and then leave it up to this\nCourt to clarify an earlier decision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except if they think we didn't\nknow what we were doing. I --\nMS. BLATT: I think that the Court of Appeals --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- they ignore it if they -- if\nthey think that we didn't know what we were doing.\nMS. BLATT: Well, they could have --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Only when it's perfectly clear\nthat we didn't know it.\n[Laughter.]\nMS. BLATT: We do think that the judgment did\nsweep more broadly than the circumstances --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You don't think there's even\nan arguable basis for saying we resolved the statutory\nquestion that's presented now, do you?\nMS. BLATT: No, because usually the Court\ndoesn't decide important -- the construction of a Federal\nstatute, a Federal criminal statute, without discussing\nit. It was -- I don't want to say \"buried in footnotes,\"\nbut it was mentioned in the footnotes at the petition\nstage the second time around, and then it dropped out of\nthe case. And even the United States didn't discuss it --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it's not mentioned in the\nopinion.\nMS. BLATT: It's not mentioned in the opinion.\nIt's not mentioned in the briefs, at the merits stage. It\nwas not mentioned by the Seventh Circuit. At the same\ntime, the court, at the end, did say that all of the\npredicate acts had to be reversed.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Blatt.\nMr. Chemerinsky.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN CHEMERINSKY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Good morning, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nThe Seventh Circuit did exactly the right thing\nin this case. It sent the case back to the District Court\nand asked the District Court to determine whether an\ninjunction could remain, based on the four counts of\nphysical violence and threats of violence. It asked the\nDistrict Court to determine whether or not the Hobbs Act\napplies to physical violence and threats of violence apart\nfrom extortion and robbery. This made great sense. No\ncourt, in this long litigation, had yet discussed the\nmeaning of the Hobbs Act and whether it applies to\nphysical violence and threats of violence apart from\nextortion and robbery.\nThere's already been a good deal of discussion\nabout what this Court meant in its prior decision. I\nthink you find clarification if you look at page 399 of\nyour prior decision, where the Court lists the predicate\nacts that it was considering. And if you add up the\nnumbers, it adds to 117 predicate acts, but if you go to\nthe jury's verdict, the special interrogatories, they\nfound 121 acts. What was omitted from the Supreme Court's\nlisting last time were the four counts of physical\nviolence and threats of violence in violation of the Hobbs\nAct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's true, but don't\nyou have the further difficulty that we didn't merely\nreverse with respect to the -- to the Hobbs Act\nviolations, or to the listed ones. We made it clear. We\nsaid, expressly, that the judgment had to be reversed,\nwhich seems to sweep everything within it, doesn't it?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. What this\nCourt did was reverse and remand for further\nconsideration, consistent with the decision of this Court.\nSince this Court had not considered the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But, I mean, that's what we\nalways say. And it may be that there is absolutely\nnothing to do, at that point, except enter judgment for\none side and be done with it.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But this Court has been clear\nthat it only decides the issues that it speaks to. It's\nnot plausible, Your Honor, that this Court was deciding a\nmajor unresolved issue of Federal criminal law without\never speaking to the question --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I think -- I think, you\nknow, your argument is fine, but the trouble is, if the\nquestion is, \"Did the Seventh Circuit honor the judgment\nof this Court?\" I think there's a pretty good argument\nthat it not -- that it did not, based upon the fact that\nwe, in effect, summed up everything we were purporting to\nsay with the phrase that the judgment itself had to be\nreversed.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Except, Your Honor, this Court\nhas said that it doesn't decide issues that weren't\npresented to it. And if you look at page 397 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's not talking about the\ndeciding of issues; he's talking about reversing a\njudgment. You don't have to go into what the issues are\nin order to follow that instruction. The judgment is\nreversed. And if there were issues that should have been\nresolved in order to reverse the judgment, and that\nweren't, it would seem to me that your remedy would not be\nto say to the Court of Appeals, \"Well, the Supreme Court\ndidn't mean what it said,\" or, \"didn't know what it was\ndoing,\" but, rather, to move for reconsideration here.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. Rehearing is\nto issues that were decided by this Court. This Court\nclearly did not speak to the meaning of the Hobbs Act.\nAnd so, it was completely appropriate for the Seventh\nCircuit to say that this Court considered the issues, in\nterms of what extortion was about, whether the injunction\nis permissible under civil RICO. If you look at the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are you saying you couldn't --\nyou couldn't file a motion for rehearing on the ground\nthat the Court neglected to address four points that were\nmade very -- you made nothing of them in the -- in the\nargument or in the briefs. It was almost not considered\nat all. You mean that when a judgment is issued that\nis so clearly, in your view, erroneous, you can't come to\nthe Court and say, \"The judgment is erroneous, you forgot\nto address these issues\"? I hope you can do that in a\nmotion for rehearing.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor, it's not\nrequired to present it that way. And I think what's\nincorrect about your phrasing is, it was Petitioners that\ndid not present this. It was the same Petitioners last\ntime. They presented to this Court the questions as to\nthe meaning of \"extortion\" and whether injunctions were\npermissible under civil RICO. In fact, if you look at\npage 397 of your prior decision, it clearly states that\nthere were two issues presented, what \"extortion\" means\nunder the Hobbs Act and whether injunctions are\npermissible under civil RICO. I think it was completely\nappropriate, then, for Respondents to say this Court\ndidn't deal with the four issues in -- concerning whether\nviolence and threats of violence are separately from the\nHobbs Act. And it was then permissible to say to the\nSeventh Circuit, \"These remain as a basis for relief.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They would have to say not just\nthat. They would have to say, \"The court did not deal\nwith those four issues, and, therefore, its judgment was\nerroneous.\" They would have to say that in order to -- in\norder to act the way they did --\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- because our judgment was\n\"reverse.\"\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, if this Court had\nentered judgment for Petitioners, which it could have,\nthen you would be correct. But, instead, what this Court\ndid, as I said, is reverse and remand for consideration.\nAnd the Seventh Circuit --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we look -- do we --\ndo we typically enter judgment, ourselves?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, typically you don't. But\nit is certainly permissible and possible for this Court to\ndo so.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When was the last time\nwe did that?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: I don't know the answer to\nthat, Your Honor, other than, of course, as a court, this\nCourt obviously could enter judgment for Petitioners. The\nfact that this Court said --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I don't think we would\nactually enter judgment. We'd -- we might reverse with\ninstructions to have the lower court enter judgment, but\nwe wouldn't enter the judgment ourselves.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, the Court could\ncertainly, and, more likely, would do what you say. It\ncould also affect the judgment --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The mandate, in this case,\nremanded, is that what you --\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So further proceedings --\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: That's right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- consistent with the\nopinion.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: And my only point is, since\nthis Court clearly said it was dealing with 117 of the\nacts, and clearly did not mention the four counts of\nviolence and threats of violence under the Hobbs Act --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it also said, in\nthe last paragraph, \"all of the predicate acts supporting\nthe jury's verdict.\"\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: That's right. And the\nquestion, of course, is, What does \"all\" refer to here?\nAnd I would say, if you go back to page 399, it lists the\npredicate acts that it's referring to and there --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it says --\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: -- are 117 listed --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- \"all the predicate\nacts supporting the jury's finding of a RICO violation.\"\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, it's quite clear\nwhat \"all\" was referring to.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Chief Justice Roberts,\nthen the assumption would have to be that this Court was\ndeciding the four counts, in terms of violence and threats\nof violence, even though it wasn't presented in the cert\npetition, even though it wasn't briefed, and even though\nit was never discussed in this Court's opinion. And I\nthink it was quite logical for the Seventh Circuit to say\nthe appropriate thing to do is to let the District Court\ndecide whether any injunctive relief was appropriate,\nbased on those four counts; and, if so, what that\nprovision of the Hobbs Act means.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Chemerinsky, if we turn\nfrom what this Court did, or did not, think about last\ntime around to what those four counts were, would I look\nto find out what were those four acts of violence that\nremain in the case? I could not find, in any of the\npapers before us, any specific definition of what those\nacts of violence were. I mean, the jury was given -- I\ndon't know what -- was it a dozen possibilities? And they\nfound four. But which four, we have no idea.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor, that would be\na reason why this case should go back to the District\nCourt, because that's the judge who tried the case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he -- but wasn't this\ntried to a jury? That was a jury that made those\nfindings.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the jury is no longer\nsitting.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But the judge presided over\nthe jury trial, and the judge could identify if there were\nfour acts of violence and threats of violence to obstruct\ninterstate commerce.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He knows that there were four\nacts. He knows that he -- under his instructions, the\njury could pick 12. How could he know which four the jury\nhomed in on?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Justice Ginsburg, he\ndoesn't need to know which four. What he needs to\ndetermine is, Did the record that was presented to the\njury support the finding that there were four acts of\nviolence and threats of violence? And we'd suggest that\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But does it -- when what\nturns on that finding is injunctive relief, the judge\nmight very well be influenced by what those particular\nacts were. He might say one set of four was not adequate\nto issue this injunction, but another set of four would\nbe. And we just don't know -- we don't know what those\nacts were. The jury is not to be called back. The\nSeventh Circuit said \"no more evidence.\" So, if we get\ndown to those four acts, how can we say those are\nsufficient to uphold an injunction, when we don't even\nknow what the acts were?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But the traditional rule is to\ninterpret the jury's verdict in a way that's most\nfavorable to its conclusion. And so, here what the judge\nhas to decide is, based on the record, were there four\nacts of violence or threats of violence to obstruct\ninterstate commerce? And we'd suggest it would be quite\neasy for the judge to identify four such acts.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you say \"most favorable\nto its conclusion,\" but did the jury conclude that there\nshould be an injunction?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, of course, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's up to the judge.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: -- but the jury --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, I mean, the principle that\nyou interpret a verdict in the manner most favorable to\nits conclusion has no application here at all.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor, the jury did\nfind, in special interrogatory 4(e), that there was\nviolence and threats of violence and in final interrogatory\n8 that it was to obstruct interstate commerce.\nAlso here, remember the judge held a separate\nhearing after the jury verdict, before issuing injunction.\nAnd if, on the basis of the evidence that he heard during\nthe trial and that special hearing, he found four acts of\nviolence and threats of violence, he then has to decide\nwhat injunctive relief is appropriate. And, of course, he\nwould also, consistent --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You mean it's up --\nI don't understand that. The judge, in order to issue the\ninjunction, becomes a second fact-finder, and he can find\nfour -- he can pick four out of the twelve, perhaps four\nthat the jury had not picked?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, since this is an\ninjunction, he is allowed to consider the evidence that he\nheard, since he was sitting in an equitable matter. And\nso, there were actually two presentations --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, he can -- he can actually\nmake a finding. And it -- and it could be that the jury\nfound that eight of them weren't valid, and the judge, in\norder to issue an injunction, can contradict the jury and\nsay, \"You know, I find that other four\"?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, when it comes to\ninjunctive relief, the judge can hold a separate hearing,\nand that's exactly what happened here. And I believe the\nissue for the judge on remand would be, Were there four\nacts of violence or threats of violence to obstruct\ninterstate commerce? And I think the record clearly\nindicates there were. The judge said, here, \"There is\nenough evidence, to fill this courtroom, of illegal acts\nby the Respondents.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Seventh Circuit in\nits most recent expression said, \"It may well be that the\njudge will decide that those 4 predicate acts\" -- as\nopposed to 121 going in, 4 -- \"were not sufficient to\nsupport certainly a nationwide injunction, but perhaps not\nany injunction.\"\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: That's correct, Your Honor.\nThat's why it was appropriate for the Seventh Circuit to\nremand the case to the District Court, because if the\ncourt were to conclude that an injunction is not\nappropriate, then anything that would be said about the\nmeaning of the Hobbs Act or about civil RICO would then\njust be an advisory opinion. And that's why this Court,\nwe believe, should also send the case back to the District\nCourt. But if it reaches the meaning of the Hobbs Act or\ncivil RICO, we believe that this is a situation there the\nplain meaning of the statute clearly controls.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there anything that\n-- under your reading of the Hobbs Act, that isn't covered\nby the FACE Act?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, yes, Your Honor. The\nnature of the relief is certainly different under the\nHobbs Act than under the FACE Act. Also, of course, at\nthe time this action was brought, 19 years ago, the FACE\nAct didn't exist.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know. But in\nterms of the -- we now have specific legislation addressed\nto the specific context. And all of the acts that you're\ncomplaining of in the original suit are actionable under\nthe FACE Act, aren't they?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'd like you to get to the\nmeaning of the Hobbs Act.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I'll try to focus my own\nthoughts on this by saying two objections to what you're\narguing, related, that when they passed the Hobbs Act, it\nhad a section 2, and section 2 said that, \"This is an Act\nthat forbids robbery and extortion, all involving\ninterstate commerce. And robbery/extortion involve\nproperty.\" Then it had a section 5. And section 5 said,\n\"This Act forbids physical violence or threats of violence\nrelated to section 2.\" Now, all that happened since then\nis, there was a recodification. And the recodification\nwasn't meant to change anything substantive.\nSecond and related point: Enmons. For 35 years,\nworking people in this country have thought they had a\nright to strike, free of the Hobbs Act. And your\ninterpretation, as the AFL-CIO points out, will gut the\nright to strike.\nNow, those are two strong arguments against you,\nand I'd like to hear your response.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Thank you. And I'll address\nthem, first and then second.\nAs to the first point, you correctly quote the\n1946 statute, but the 1948 revision was approved by\nCongress, and it specifically says \"robbery or extortion\nor attempts so to do,\" comma, \"or physical violence or\nthreats of violence.\" This Court has said, in cases like\nUnited States versus Ron Pair, that commas have to be\ngiven meaning. This Court, in many cases, such as FCC\nversus Pacifica, said, \"or\" must be given meaning. There\nis --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we've also said\nthat we don't assume a substantive change from a\nrecodification.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor -- the statute\nhas been approved by Congress. It is that which is\nauthoritative. And this Court has said, in other cases,\nlike United States versus Wells, and State Farm versus\nTashire, that revisers notes are often erroneous. This\nCourt has said the cardinal rule of statutory construction\nis that the plain language must be followed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your argument\nrequires us to assume that Congress intended a substantive\nchange when it recodified the Hobbs Act.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: That's right. This -- my\nargument is that the plain language makes clear that\nCongress did enact a substantive change. And, indeed, to\ninterpret the law as Petitioner suggests, would render the\nwords about \"physical violence or threats of violence\" as\nmere surplusage. And so, for example, some of the\nillustrations that were mentioned earlier, one was about\nthe possibility of a planned pride and attempt. But, in a\nmodel penal code, section 5.01, it's clear that any\nsubstantial step is sufficient for an attempt that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who -- who's enacted the\nmodel penal code?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: I mention the model penal code\nas just something that's regarded as an authoritative\ndefinition with regard to criminal law. There's many\njurisdictions around the country, including at the Federal\nlevel, consistently saying a substantial step is\nsufficient for an attempt.\nAnother example that was mentioned was the\nsubordinate enforcer. But the subordinate enforcer\nwould be likely considered part of a conspiracy or an\naccomplice.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Chemerinsky, the problem\nthat I have, and Justice Breyer expressed, is, we have the\nreviser's notes that suggest, \"I was just getting rid of\nextra words. I was making this a tighter provision.\" And\nthere's not anything to indicate that Congress considered\nany change in the substance of the Act.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, there is almost no\nlegislative history for the 1948 revision. All there is,\nas you rightly say, is the reviser's notes. But this\nCourt has said that the reviser's notes are not\nauthoritative. And this Court has said, on so many\noccasions, that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But here's a -- the reviser\ntelling us, \"I did this, and I did this to clean up the\nAct, to make it less wordy.\"\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes. But even if that's\nregarded as authoritative, this Court has so often said\nlegislative history cannot justify ignoring plain meaning.\nAnd, given the comma and the word \"or\" and the fact that,\notherwise, the words \"by physical violence\" would have no\nmeaning --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me --\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: -- that's the plain meaning.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- let me talk --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- about the comma. I don't --\nI don't -- I don't understand your argument on that point.\nI mean, it says, \"Whoever, in any way or degree,\nobstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement or\nany article or commodity in commerce by robbery or\nextortion or attempts or conspires to do so,\" comma --\nthat's the comma you're talking about?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- \"or threatens physical\nviolence to any person or property,\" but it continues, \"in\nfurtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in\nviolation of this section.\" Now, the only thing that this\nsection has, prior to that statement, said to be a\nviolation is obstructing/delaying by robbery, extortion,\nor attempt or conspiracy to robbery or extortion.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. Two points\nhere. First, it says \"a plan.\" It's clear, there is --\nit's a plan to obstruct, interfere, or affect commerce.\nThe others, Your Honor, you quickly skipped over --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Plan to do anything in\nviolation of this section,\" which is not just obstructing\ncommerce, but obstructing it by robbery, extortion, or\nattempt or conspiracy to robbery or extortion.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. I think that\ndoes deprive the comma or the word \"or\" meaning. And, in\nfact, it deprives the title of meaning, because the title\nhere can be used when the title makes clear that it's\nabout violence to obstruct interstate commerce. I'd also\npoint out some words --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's a jurisdictional\nhook, isn't it?\nJUSTICE BREYER: When you see something in a\ncriminal statute that forbids \"affecting commerce by,\"\nthat means that Congress wants to prevent the conduct that\nwill follow the words \"by,\" and it needs a jurisdictional\nhook, so it puts in \"affecting commerce.\" That's how I've\nalways understood the Federal criminal code. Am I --\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- wrong in that?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor. Here, what\nit's saying is that Congress is prohibiting \"plans to\nobstruct commerce by robbery or extortion or physical\nviolence or threats of violence.\" And, Justice Scalia,\nwhen you read the statute to me, some of the words that\nwere skipped over quickly were the words \"so to do.\"\nNotice it says \"with regard to robbery or extortion or\nattempts to do so,\" comma. If they meant violence and\nphysical violence to only refer to extortion or robbery,\nas they did with \"attempts,\" then \"so to do\" could have\nbeen put into that clause, as well.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is -- what meaning do you\ngive to the phrase \"in furtherance of a plan or purpose to\ndo anything in violation of this section\"? Under your\ninterpretation, you could just drop that -- drop that\nphrase completely.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Not at all, because it makes\nclear that Congress didn't mean, here, to criminalize\nevery act of violence that occurs. It has to be, in order\nto be actionable, a \"plan of physical violence to obstruct\ninterstate commerce.\" That's why this doesn't apply --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not a violation of\nthe section. \"Obstructing interstate commerce\" is not a\nviolation of 1951.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. What is a\nviolation of 1951 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- is obstructing it by robbery\nor by extortion or attempt or conspiracy to robbery or\nextortion.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: I disagree, because I think\nthen it does reduce the words \"physical violence or\nthreats of physical violence\" to mere surplusage.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, no, because the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what do you say to the\nresponse --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- the counsel for the\nGovernment explained that if, in the course of committing\na robbery, some bystander is physically injured, it's\ncovered.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I mean, that's\nunderstandable, isn't it?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. The reason\nis, if somebody is injured in the course of a robbery,\nthat's already punished as part of the robbery. In fact,\nthe Federal sentencing guidelines make clear that harms\nthat are caused while committing a crime are punished as a\npart of that crime. You --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you're --\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: -- don't need to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- convicted --\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: -- include that language.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- of the crime, but you cannot\nbe indicted as a separate crime. This makes it a separate\noffense.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying we -- you can use\nit to aggravate the punishment for some other offense, but\nthis does -- this does something quite beyond that. It\nsays it is a separate offense.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor, for every\ncriminal law, injuries that are committed by those who are\nengaged in the criminal activity are punished as a part of\nthat criminal act.\nNow, Justice Breyer, your second --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you say they are punished\nas a part of the act, but Justice Scalia's point is still\ntrue, it only goes to punishment. The way this is\nwritten, it may be charged as a separate offense.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor, there would\nbe no need to charge a separate offense. If you look at\n1951(b) --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I -- I mean, one is --\nI'm attempted to say, \"Well, tell Congress that.\" If they\nwant to create a separate offense, they can do it.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. If you look\nat section 1951(b), where it defines \"robbery\" and\n\"extortion,\" it already includes \"violence\" in the\ndefinition of \"robbery\" and \"extortion.\" There would be\nno need for Congress to separately --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But isn't the reasonable\nreading of that, \"violence in the course of achieving --\nfor the purpose of achieving the object in question,\" as\nopposed to, in effect, a \"by-blow against a bystander\"?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor, I don't think\nso, since the statute defines \"robbery\" and \"extortion,\"\nin 1951(b), specifically to include acts of violence, then\nall the things we're talking about after the crime would\nalready be part of what's prohibited by the statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Mr. --\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: It could already be charged --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I want to give you a chance,\nbecause you're quite right in thinking that I'm moved, in\nlarge part -- or worried, in large part -- not about this\nlanguage, but about the change in Federal criminal law.\nAnd the change in Federal criminal law, if you're right,\nway beyond this case, would transform virtually every\nthreat of violence made anywhere in the United States into\na serious Federal crime. At the least, it would -- and\nmake a major change in threats of violence on the picket\nline. And those are two aspects of the same thing. And\nI'm worried about the upsetting of expectations way\noutside the context of this case and making a major change\nin Federal labor law, for example.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Let me start labor law and\nthen go more generally.\nSection 1951(c) has a specific provision that\nmakes clear that the Hobbs Act was not meant to change the\nprotection of labor unions. And, in fact, every one of\nthe statutory references in 1951(c) is to a statute\nprotecting labor unions. Enmons specifically says --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What does it -- 1951(c) says\nwhat?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: It lists -- it says \"nothing\nin this statute is meant to alter the protections of,\" and\nthen it lists a whole number of statutes, and those are\nall statutes that protect labor unions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, but I -- then perhaps I\n-- that's an old statute, 1951(c), isn't it? Is it\nsomething brand new?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, this is the Hobbs Act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Section 3 --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. What is it --\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: -- of the Hobbs Act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the case that interpreted\nthe Hobbs Act, which is Enmons --\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- seems to rely, for the\nlabor-union exemption, on the fact that a threat of\nviolence in an effort to obtain legitimate wages is not\nwithin the Act. But if we read \"legitimate wages\" out of\nthe Act, then I guess we would be left with \"the threat of\nviolence.\"\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. And the\nreason is, Enmons says there's a special legislative\nhistory of the Hobbs Act specifically about labor. And\nEnmons concluded that if the violence is part of a strike\nto pursue lawful union activities, it is not actionable\nunder the Hobbs Act. Nothing that this Court would decide\nhere would change that specific protection of unions, one\nthat's codified in the statute.\nAs to your former question, nor would ruling in\nfavor of Respondents here change the criminal laws you\nsuggest. The statute would only apply to a plan to\nobstruct interstate commerce by physical violence or\nthreats of violence. Your Honor, this is an\ninterpretation --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, the -- it's not a -- that's\nwrong. It says \"affect commerce.\"\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And, therefore, we have the\ninstance of any threat of violence that affects commerce\nbecomes a Federal crime subject to 20 years of\nimprisonment. And, of course, in today's world, as you\nknow, I believe almost everything affects commerce. And\nif I'm even close to being right, this is a major\nincursion of Federal law, serious criminal Federal law,\ninto what could be fairly minor matters of State criminal\nlaw.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor, because of the\nimportance of the word \"plan.\" And this goes to my answer\nto Justice Scalia earlier. The fact that it has to be a\nplan to obstruct or affect interstate commerce is an\nimportant limitation here. And it's key to remember that\nthis is the position that the United States Government\ntook for at least 25 years -- from the Franks case, in\n1974, to the Milton case, in the Fourth Circuit in 1998,\nthe Yankowski case, in 1999 -- and it hasn't had those\neffects. But if it does, Your Honor, then the appropriate\nsolution is for Congress to change the statute, but not\nfor this Court to ignore the plain meaning of the law.\nThe final issue that was presented concerns the\nRICO statute. Here, section 1964(a) clearly authorizes\ncourts to have jurisdiction to issue injunctions. Unlike\nthe Sherman Act provision that only authorized the\nGovernment to seek injunctive relief, section 1964(a)\nallows Federal courts of jurisdiction, in any instance.\nThis Court has said, in many instances, as Chief Justice\nRoberts pointed out, such as Franklin versus Gwinnett\nCounty, that when Federal courts have jurisdiction, they\nretain equitable power unless Congress expressly stripped\nthat authority. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, your friend's\nanswer was that that was an implied right-of-action case;\nand, therefore, the remedies had not been spelled out; and\nso, you assume the broader remedies. What's wrong with\nthat answer?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor, because this\nCourt has said, in any instance, Federal courts have\nequitable power unless Congress has expressly stripped it\nof that power. United States versus Umansky would be an\nexample where this Court said that, as well as the\nlanguage from Franklin versus Gwinnett County. And that's\nespecially true here, where Congress, in the RICO statute,\nspecifically said that it should be broadly construed.\nThis Court, in Sedima versus Imrex, said especially as to\nthe remedial provision, section 1964, this should be broad\nconstruction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As you read it, can a private\nparty get a preliminary injunction?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor, in terms of\nthe Government is specifically authorized by 1964(b) to get\na preliminary injunction. And the reason for that is,\ngenerally the Government can't get injunctions to stop\ncriminal activity. 1964(b) was added for that. But I'd\nsay 1964(a), to go to your specific question, would\nauthorize anyone to be able to go to the Federal court to\nuse any of the Federal court's inherent powers.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, a private party could get\nan -- not only permanent, but preliminary --\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- injunction.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes. 1964(b) was added\nbecause of the traditional common-law rule that the\nGovernment generally can't get such injunctions.\nOur position is simple. We believe that the\nHobbs Act was changed precisely to deal with the\nsituations where there might be a radical animal-activist\ngroup that might be blowing up restaurants that serve\nmeat, or clothing stores, or where there might be\nsituations where racists were blowing up businesses owned\nby blacks or Jews. That's what the Hobbs Act does. And\nthe RICO statute provides, as Congress intended, a broad\nremedial scheme.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Chemerinsky, I -- you said\nearlier that our -- that we \"reversed and remanded.\" That\nwas not in our opinion, though, as it sometimes is,\n\"Therefore, you know, the case is remanded.\" It doesn't\nsay that. Our opinion here just says \"reversed.\"\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Right. But, Your Honor, this\ncase --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It just says --\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: -- obviously was sent back --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- \"reversed.\"\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: -- to the Seventh Circuit.\nAnd the Seventh Circuit then had to interpret what this\nCourt decided. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see. And they interpreted\n\"reversed\" to mean \"remanded.\"\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Because this Court had not\nconsidered --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: -- the four acts --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: -- of violence and threats of\nviolence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, that enabled them to say\nthat what we meant was not \"reversed,\" but \"reversed and\nremanded.\"\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: What this -- what the Seventh\nCircuit did was look at this Court's opinion and see that\nthe statement of the issues, on page 397 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't look at the last\nline of our opinion, which said \"reversed.\"\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor, that would\nthen assume that this Court decided an issue about the\nmeaning of the Hobbs Act that was never presented in the\ncert petitions, never briefed, never addressed in the\nopinion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They made the assumption that\nthis Court has an obligation to reason why, and there was\nno reason why given as to those four counts.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: That's right. No discussion\nwhatsoever, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a broad principle.\nWhenever a Court of Appeals thinks that we haven't really\nresolved all the issues in the case, they can ignore our\norder that says \"reversed.\"\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Of course not, Your Honor.\nWhat the Seventh Circuit had to decide was, What about the\nfour counts of violence or threats of violence that were\nfound by the jury? Since they weren't ever discussed, the\nCourt of Appeals did exactly the right thing, sent it back\nto the District Court to decide whether an injunction is\nstill appropriate; and, if so, what the Hobbs Act means.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Congress never\ndiscussed the change in the Hobbs Act that you're\nproposing, in 1948.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: That's true. But it's unusual\nthat, in 1948, Congress actually passed that statute. And\nso, that's binding. Here, the Seventh Circuit --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We also actually entered a\nmandate, too.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, that's true.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nChemerinsky.\nMr. Untereiner, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN UNTEREINER\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. UNTEREINER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI just want to make a few very quick points.\nFirst, I heard Mr. Chemerinsky say that the\nthird clause was unnecessary in the Hobbs Act, because\nrobbery and extortion necessarily involve acts or threats\nof violence. I just would like to point out that the\nHobbs Act also covers official extortion, which does not\nrequire acts or threats of violence.\nSecondly, on the Enmons point that Justice\nBreyer was asking about, you're quite right, Justice\nBreyer, that to accept the other side's position would\neffectively overrule Enmons. Enmons did not rely, in any\nway, on section 1951(c), had nothing to do with the\nCourt's analysis. If you look at section 1951(c), which\nis reprinted in the Scheidler blue brief at page 2(a),\nyou'll see that it just refers to some labor statutes. It\nsays that the Hobbs Act is not meant to repeal, modify, or\naffect those laws. But those laws don't protect violent\nconduct, so that's a red herring.\nAnd, number three, I'd just like to point out\nthat in this Court's last decision in this case, the Court\nmade clear that coercion is not covered by the Hobbs Act.\nBut under the Respondent's reading, some acts of coercion\nwould, in fact, be covered by the Hobbs Act.\nFinally, we'd just like to reiterate our request\nthat, if the Court rules in our favor, it make very clear,\nin remanding the case, that judgment should be entered in\nfavor of Petitioners.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
