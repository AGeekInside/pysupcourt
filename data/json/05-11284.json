        "content": "(11:10 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in 05-11284, Abdul-Kabir vs. Quarterman, and\n05-11287, Brewer versus Quarterman.\nMr. Owen.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. OWEN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. OWEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen this Court granted review in mid\nOctober in these consolidated cases, the cases\nexemplified the Fifth Circuit's settled approach to\nreviewing claims of error under this Court's 1989\ndecision in Penry v. Lynaugh. In both cases the court\nbelow failed to take seriously the requirement that\ncapital jurors have a meaningful basis for giving effect\nto the relevant mitigating qualities of a defendant's\nevidence, and in both cases the court below found as a\nfactual matter, both against common sense and this\nCourt's holdings, that reasonable jurors would regard\nevidence that a defendant had experienced significant\nmistreatment or abuse as a child or had mental\nimpairments as an adult as reasons to find him less\ndangerous rather than more dangerous.\nBut those opinions, however incorrect, no\nlonger represent the Fifth Circuit's view of Penry. In\nmid December the Fifth Circuit decided in its en banc\ndecision in Nelson vs. Quarterman to take a sharp turn\naway from its prior treatment of Penry claims and to\nfollow instead this Court's guidance in Tennard and\nSmith. Under such circumstances, where the assumption\nthat we imagine underlay this Court's decision to grant\nreview in this case has been so profoundly changed by an\nintervening decision of the court below, we respectfully\nsuggested by motion that the Court return these cases,\nvacate the judgments, return them to the Fifth Circuit\nfor further consideration in light of the new opinion in\nNelson.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why, when we are told\nthat, that the State will surely challenge Nelson in\nthis Court, and we already have the issue before us, so\nall that you would achieve is delay, just substituting\nthe Nelson case for this one?\nMR. OWEN: I don't believe, Your Honor,\nthat, that all that would be accomplished by that would\nbe certainly not just delay. I think that if the Court\nchooses to wait for the State's cert petition in Nelson,\nthe Court could certainly put our cases aside and hold\nthem awaiting Nelson -- Nelson's cert petition should be\nfiled by mid March -- and then could make its judgment\nabout whether to grant cert in Nelson or not.\nIf it granted cert in Nelson it could decide\nthe three cases together; if it found Nelson raised no\nquestions that were worthy of review, it could either\nproceed to decide these cases or send them back to the\nFifth Circuit. I think that the State's decision,\nthough, Your Honor, is based on a, a misreading of\nNelson. I think that the State has suggested to the\nCourt that Nelson is in the State's phrase a narrow\nfact-based decision and I think that's not, I think\nthat's not a fair characterization of the Nelson --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why can't we just\nread Nelson and then say in these cases whether or not\nit's correct?\nMR. OWEN: I think the main reason, Your\nHonor, is that these cases aren't Nelson, and that\nNelson if it presents issues that are worthy of the\nCourt's consideration, that would be the better vehicle,\nrather than trying to use in effect these cases to\ndecide issues that are presented by a different set of\nfacts.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If these cases aren't\nNelson that's a reason why we should decide these cases;\nit seems to me.\nMR. OWEN: Well, Your Honor, I am, I am\nconfident that if the Court chooses to proceed on the\nmerits of this case that we will prevail on the merits,\nuntil it finds --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why don't you try to\nconvince us of that?\nMR. OWEN: Then let me turn, let me turn to\nour, our merits, Your Honor.\nThe issue before the Court in this case as\nwe said is whether the jury instructions gave the jurors\na meaningful basis for considering the relevant\nmitigating qualities of these two Defendants' mitigating\nevidence. In Mr. Brewer's case that included the fact\nthat he was hospitalized for treatment for a major\nepisode of depression about three months before the\nmurder, and the fact that the evidence indicated he had\nsuffered serious abuse, serious physical and emotional\nabuse from his father as a teenager. In Mr. Cole's case\nthe evidence indicated that as a result of neglect and\ndeprivation that he suffered as a child, he had himself\nemotional problems, fragmented personality, chronic\ndepression, enormous need for nurturance, a lot of\nemotional turmoil and problems that continued into\nadulthood.\nAnd in addition to that, the expert who\ntestified at Mr. Cole's trial indicated that he had been\ngiven a set of generally accepted neuropsychological\ntests and that on those tests he had scored below normal\nand on some of them very far below normal, under the\nfifth percentile. And as a result that he probably\nsuffers from some sort of central nervous dysfunction\nwhich limits his impulse control. We respectfully\nsuggest that under this Court's decision in Penry, those\nare all the kinds of facts about these two Defendants\nthat could reasonably support a juror in concluding that\na life sentence rather than the death penalty was an\nappropriate sentence.\nBut because the jurors were never asked\nwhether the mitigating evidence reduced the Defendant's\nculpability in such a way as to call for a life\nsentence, the resulting death sentences are unreliable.\nThe jurors are asked only two questions as the Court\nwell knows. But just to review, under the pre-1991\nTexas statute jurors were only asked two questions: Was\nthe crime committed deliberately and is the Defendant\nlikely to pose a continuing threat to society? And\nthose instructions alone as has been mentioned earlier\nthis morning, don't mention mitigating evidence; the\nverdict form doesn't mention mitigating evidence; and so\nthis Court has held repeatedly that whether that two\nquestion format satisfies the Eighth Amendment's\nindividualized sentencing requirement is a matter of the\nevidence that's presented in a particular case, how it's\nargued to the jury, and what are the jurors told about\nthe meaning of their instruction.\nAnd we believe that in this case, throughout\nthe trial -- in both of these cases, excuse me --\nthroughout the trials the jurors were emphatically told\nthat they were not entitled in deciding the future\ndangers test question to engage in any sort of broad\ninquiry into these Defendants' moral culpability.\nInstead, the prosecutors in both cases made very clear\nto the jurors during jury selection that in answering\nthe future dangerousness question you must put to one\nside your opinion about whether the Defendant's\nbackground, for example, calls for a particular sentence\nand answer the question solely on, as the prosecutor put\nit, the basis of the facts. And we feel that the\nevidence in this case very strongly would have supported\nthe inference that these, both of these Defendants were\nlikely to be dangerous --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How would you\ncompare that evidence with the evidence in Penry itself?\nMR. OWEN: I think, Your Honor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: These are closer\ncases than Penry, I think. You'd have to concede that,\nwouldn't you?\nMR. OWEN: I think they are different cases,\nYour Honor, I'm not willing to concede that they are\ncloser cases. I think that in, in the juror's mind, the\nonly conclusion that could be drawn from the evidence in\nthese cases is that the Defendants are likely to be\ndangerous in the future. That is exactly the same\nconclusion that would have been compelled by the\nevidence in Penry. I think that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does that, if the\nevidence, suppose we think the evidence is weaker, it's\nstill evidence of childhood abuse and mental disorder of\nsome kind, and those are relevant mitigating factors.\nMR. OWEN: Absolutely. Absolutely, Your\nHonor,.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you -- if your case is\nless strong than maybe the jury will decide it the other\nway. But it doesn't mean that those factors are not\nmitigating factors.\nMR. OWEN: I couldn't agree more, Your\nHonor. I think it's very clearly settled by Tennard and\nother cases going back to 1976 that facts like a\ndeprived or abused background or mental impairment are\ncertainly mitigating. And with further response to your\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Tennard, Tennard was\ndecided after the State decision here, wasn't it?\nMR. OWEN: This Court's decision in Tennard\npostdates the State court decisions in both of these\ncases. Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And where is -- this is an\nAEDPA case, isn't it?\nMR. OWEN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So we're, we're asking\nwhether this State court made an unreasonable decision\nat the time, and at the time regardless of what the\nFifth Circuit has now said, at the time under Johnson,\nand -- and there is another earlier case, we said that\nyou didn't have to give full mitigating effects; as long\nas there was some manner in which mitigating effect\ncould be given that was enough.\nMR. OWEN: The Court has been consistent --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So I think Tennard is\nutterly irrelevant even if it is right.\nMR. OWEN: I, I -- I don't agree. And\nhere's why, Your Honor. Tennard was itself both a\nhabeas case and a case governed by the antiterrorism\nact, like these two cases. And so in Tennard the Court\nwas called on to decide not squarely the question of\nwhether the State court decision in that case had been\nobjectively unreasonable, but whether a reasonable\njurist could have found it to be objectively\nunreasonable such that a certificate of appealability\nwas warranted.\nMr. Tennard's case was decided by the State\ncourt in 1997, so I think it is immanent in this Court's\nruling in Tennard that at least as of 1997, it was\napparent that a, a low IQ score alone implicated the\nconcerns of Penry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did Tennard purport to\noverrule Smith, even when it came down? It simply, it\nsimply quoted language of the Justice O'Connor's\nconcurrence in an earlier case. It certainly didn't\npurport to overrule Smith?\nMR. OWEN: I, I see where Your Honor is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry, Johnson, not\nSmith.\nMR. OWEN: Yes. And I, and I -- no, it\ndidn't purport to overrule Johnson. And the reason why\nis this: I think the concept that ties this Court's\ncases together on Penry is this concept of meaningful\nconsideration. Because Your Honor focused on one bit of\nlanguage from Johnson: the jury has to be able to give\nsome effect. Elsewhere in the Johnson opinion the Court\nsaid there has to be a meaningful basis for giving\neffect to the relevant mitigating qualities of the\nevidence. And I think neither of those two phrases can\nbe read out of the context of the other.\nIn other words, it can't just be some\nimaginable, conceivable, strained effect. It has to be\nsome effect which speaks sensibly to the way that a\njuror would -- would understand the evidence to relate\nto future dangerousness. In the Johnson case, the\ndefendant's evidence was his chronological youth, and I\nbelieve that it was, it is sensible for the Court to\nfind that a reasonable juror could conclude that, that\nits relevance to culpability and its relevance to future\ndangerousness are essentially coextensive. This case is\nnot like that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In Brewer --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, in Johnson wasn't\nthere also --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Wasn't there also mitigating\nevidence about a troubled, about his troubled youth,\nwhich is analogous to what was involved at least -- well\nin both of these cases?\nMR. OWEN: Very little such evidence, Your\nHonor, in Mr. Johnson's case. And in that case moreover\nthis Court's question presented, the question on which\nit granted review, was limited to the question of age,\nso this Court didn't reach or decide in Johnson the\nquestion of whether the other facts about Johnson's\nbackground that found their way before the jury might\nhave been within the jurors' effective reach.\nAnd I do think that the specific evidence in\nJohnson again was argued as a basis for a finding of\nnondangerousness, of rehabilitatability. That's utterly\nuntrue of evidence in Mr. Brewer's case and Mr. Cole's\ncase, where I think it's very clear that the evidence is\nbeing offered to provide some kind of explanation for\nthe jurors about what caused these men to commit these\nterrible crimes, not that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in, in Brewer's\ncase, it's, quoting the record, evidence of one\nhospitalization for a single episode of nonpsychotic\nmajor depression. So it was certainly opened for a jury\nto determine that as mitigating and not aggravating in\nassessing the likelihood that there was going to be\nfurther violent behavior.\nMR. OWEN: I don't think, Your Honor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Quite a bit\ndifferent than Penry.\nMR. OWEN: I don't think that you can\nseparate the diagnosis of depression, that, even that\none single episode of hospitalization for depression,\nfrom what the jury knew about Mr. Brewer's upbringing,\nfrom the fact that they knew he had been hit by his\nfather in the terms of, his mother said, numerous times.\nHe was struck with the butt of a pistol, he was hit with\na flashlight, he was hit with a stick of firewood. His\nfather told him if you ever raise your hand to me you\nbetter kill me, because I'll kill you. He saw his\nfather bloody his mother, and bruise her eyes, throw\nchairs at her.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And your submission\n-- your submission is that every juror is, or a\nreasonable juror is going to look at that, and the only\nconclusion that they are going to draw is that he is\nmore likely to be violent in the future? As opposed to\nthe conclusion that there is mitigating evidence because\nof this, that he should -- mercy should be shown to him\nin light of all of this? And I just don't see how you\ncan speculate which way the jury is going to go.\nMR. OWEN: I think that it's not simply\nspeculation, Your Honor, I think this Court recognized\nin Tennard as it did in Penry, that when there is\nevidence of mental impairment before the jury, there is\nat least the probable inference of dangerousness. The\namici before the court, both the American Academy of\nChild and Adolescent Psychiatry, on the one hand, the\nChild Welfare League of America, on the other, their\namicus briefs I think really -- really detailed the fact\nthat this is a commonplace understanding in our society.\nAnd the reason that we know that, Your\nHonor, is what the prosecutor said in his closing\nargument, where he said to the jury if you take a puppy\nand you beat that puppy, then he is going to bite and he\nis going to bite as long as he lives. There is nothing\nyou can do to change that. I think that where you\nhave --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that was in, in\nBrewer. Now --\nMR. OWEN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- there was no\nreliance or no similar statement by the prosecutor in\nAbdul-Kabir or Mr. Cole's case.\nMR. OWEN: There was no similar --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So do we have\ndifferent results in these two consolidated cases?\nMR. OWEN: No, Your Honor. I think that\nthis Court's case in -- decision in Tennard, when it's\ntalking about the inference of probable future\ndangerousness, this Court says: The jurors might well\nhave believed that Mr. Tennard would be dangerous in the\nfuture, both as an inference to be drawn from the\nevidence and because the prosecutor expressly told them\nthat's how they ought to regard the evidence.\nAnd in this case we have the prosecutor, in\nMr. Brewer's case we have the prosecutor expressly\ntelling the jury, just as the prosecutor did in Mr.\nTennard's case, what is mitigating about the guy's\nbackground --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the, so the --\nbut my point is the absence of a similar prosecutorial\nstatement in the Cole case cuts against you.\nMR. OWEN: It simply doesn't cut as far in\nfavor of us, Your Honor. The fact that in Tennard this\nCourt said that from mental impairment, a probable\ninference of dangerousness may be drawn, cuts squarely\nin our favor. And you don't even have to go to the\nlevel of inference. In Mr. Cole's case his expert\nwitnesses said that the background experiences that this\nyoung man had make him dangerous. And they, they could\nnot forecast exactly how long it might be before he\nwould conceivably age out of that. But they said is it\n10 years? It could be 15 years, it could be 20 years.\nI mean, there is just -- that doesn't give a\nreasonable juror, as -- if all you ask the juror is,\nafter they have heard that evidence is, is there a\nprobability that this guy is going to be dangerous in\nthe future? I think they would be compelled to say yes,\neven though they might say, if they were broadly\ninstructed --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is evidence of\nabatement in that case that was before the jury? So\nthat if you ask them, was it this person's fault in some\nmoral sense, that might affect whether they wish to show\nmercy? And if you ask them whether he is going to grow\nout of it, they may well say, it was not his fault\nbecause of this brain disorder and he is going to grow\nout of it and that was the evidence, and so we are not\ngoing to sentence him to death.\nMR. OWEN: I think that it's not\nunconceivable that a juror could have reasoned in that\nfashion. But I think it's not reasonably possible. I\nthink that this Court's decisions in Penry and Tennard\nsuggest that a juror's commonsensical response to\nevidence that a defendant has, presently poses a grave\ndanger as a result of his life experiences and the\nenduring impacts that they have left upon him, the\nreasonable response of a juror shown such evidence is to\nfind future dangerousness, and that that is precisely\nthe problem with the pre-1991 Texas sentencing statute.\nIf we had a broad mitigating evidence\nissue like the one that's presently given to Texas\njuries then we could all be confident that the jury had\nengaged in precisely the reasoning that the Court --\nthat the Court is hypothesizing. That they looked at\nthe evidence and said yes, he's dangerous, but he's also\ndeserving of something less than death so we will\naccomplish that by answering this issue in a certain\nway.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in Penry we\ndidn't establish a per se rule. We said it depends upon\nthe evidence. It depends upon the instructions. It\ndepends upon what the prosecutors say. It seems to me\nthat you're arguing for an absolute rule.\nMR. OWEN: I don't -- no, Your Honor, and\ndon't let me, please don't let me be misunderstood. I\ndo not believe that this is a per se rule. I think\nJohnson stands with our case. I think that Graham\nstands with our case. I think there's no -- there's no\nneed for the Court to -- to change anything other than\nto -- and it doesn't have to change anything about its\nexisting approach to Penry for our clients to prevail.\nBecause I think that if the Court looks at this evidence\nand concludes that a reasonable juror approaching this,\nthere's no reasonable probability that they would have\nfelt constrained to find him to be a future danger, then\nwe lose. But I don't think you can look at this record\nand see that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's not no\nreasonable probability, that's not the standard. The\nstandard under Smith is whether the juries can consider\nthis mitigating evidence in some manner.\nMR. OWEN: I think, Your Honor, that again,\nremoving that language from Smith, from the language in\n-- if you're talking about Johnson, I know you're\nreferring to Johnson, that the language in Johnson about\nsome effect can't be separated from the language about\nmeaningful effect.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's absolutely one step\nremoved from that.\nMR. OWEN: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I say the actual question\nis even one step removed. It's whether it is\nunreasonable to conclude otherwise than what you\nconclude, which is wrong.\nMR. OWEN: That's correct. And I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But unreasonable.\nMR. OWEN: That's correct, and I think that\nit is unreasonable. I think the State court in this\ncase had essentially two lines of authority, that it was\ntrying to decide which one controlled this case. It had\nPenry which involved evidence of mental impairment and\nchild abuse, and it had Johnson and Graham which\ninvolved evidence of youth and other background. And I\nthink that the facts of these cases, given the facts of\nthese two cases, it is objectively unreasonable to say\nthey fit over here with Johnson and Graham rather than\nthey fit over here with Penry. And that's why I think\nthe decisions by the State courts are not just wrong,\nbut objectively unreasonable.\nIf the court has no further questions, I\nwill reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Owen.\nMr. Marshall.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD L. MARSHALL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MARSHALL: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen the State court considered these Penry\nclaims in 1994, 1999 and January 2001, this Court's\ndecisions in Graham and Johnson made it clear that the\nEighth Amendment requires only that a jury be only able\nto consider mitigating evidence in some manner, not in\nevery conceivable manner. This is because virtually any\nmitigating evidence may be viewed as relevant to moral\nculpability apart from its relevance to these Texas\nspecial issues.\nCole and Brewer with sizzling bright IQ\nscores of 121 and 115, dysfunctional childhoods and\ndepression, are much more like the troubled childhood\nand youth evidence in Graham and Johnson than the mental\nretardation, brain damage and severe child abuse\nevidence in Penry. Equating these facts to Penry --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's the same kind of\nevidence. It may be weaker. In other words, it's not\nevidence of good deeds in the community. It's two\nspecific kinds of evidence, the very kinds of evidence\nthat were involved in Penry. You can argue about\nwhether this was weaker, but it's certainly different\nfrom youth and reputation for good character.\nMR. MARSHALL: Well, I disagree, Your Honor.\nIn Graham in particular, the Court was not just\nconsidering youth, the Court was considering a troubled\nchildhood, a difficult childhood in which Graham's\nmother had been hospitalized with a mental illness, his\ncustody shifted from relative to relative. That's\nexactly the same kind of evidence we have in Cole.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the evidence was that\nhe didn't react hostilely, he didn't do bad deeds. On\nthe contrary, he was gentle, kind, God fearing, and\nthat's why the jury should regard the murder as\naberrational. That was the Graham picture, whereas here\nwe're dealing with people who are dangerous.\nMR. MARSHALL: Well, Your Honor, that's not\nthe way counsel argued it to the jury in either case.\nIn both of these cases defense counsel presented his\ncase to the jury during -- through his evidence and his\nargument, that this was youthful indiscretion or it was\nan aberration, and it wouldn't happen again, which is\nexactly what Graham --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What other choice does\ndefense counsel have, given that the jury is going to\nget a question, is this man likely to be a danger in the\nfuture? What else could counsel argue?\nMR. MARSHALL: Well, Justice Ginsburg,\nthat's not the question before the Court. The question\nbefore the Court is whether the Eighth Amendment was\nviolated and whether the jury had a reasonable\nopportunity, and in --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. Well, maybe sending\ncounsel into those two questions, what violates the\nEighth Amendment instead of doing what Texas now does\nand say jury mitigating evidence is for you to judge.\nWe're not going to bottle it up inside of two special\nquestions.\nMR. MARSHALL: Respectfully, Justice\nGinsburg, that's not the question before the Court,\nthough. We're trying to determine in this case whether\nthe State courts unreasonably determined that these\njuries had a fair opportunity to consider that evidence.\nAnd I think looking at argument, when we're determining\nthe reasonableness of that decision, looking at\ncounsel's argument is all we have to go on in\ndetermining whether the jury had a fair shot. Now I\nthink if you look back at the '90s --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But realistically, a\ndefense counsel who knows that the jury is going to have\nthose two questions, he's got to fit his argument to the\njury into those questions.\nMR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, that was a\nstrategic choice, though. This is not a Sixth Amendment\nclaim. We're looking at the Eighth Amendment now. And\nso what counsel chose to do is not the question. We're\nlooking at what he did, and we've got this record to\nwork with.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're looking at what\nTexas law forced him to do.\nMR. MARSHALL: I don't think that's the\nissue before the Court, Your Honor. I think what we're\nlooking at is whether he -- the jury had a fair\nopportunity here, regardless of what counsel chose not\nto do or what the statute forced him to do. The fact is\nwhen the State courts looked at these claims in 1994 and\n1999, this evidence was much more like Graham than it\nwas like Penry, and it was reasonable for them to decide\nthat there was no Penry error in these cases because of\nthat fact. And I think it's worth mentioning that if\nthat's not the case, then I think we've arrived at the\npoint where Penry has swallowed the rule announced in\nJurek 31 years ago and it -- to which it was only\nsupposed to be an exception.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Jurek was a facial\nchallenge, and the Court said no, on its face we can see\nthat there are things that would fit into it. Good\ncharacter would fit into it. But Jurek said as applied,\nwe're not certainly not ruling on that. All we're\nsaying is it doesn't fall on its face, and then as cases\ncome up the law is filled out. But Jurek doesn't say --\nJurek didn't say across the board, it's enough that\nthere are these two special factors, that everything can\nbe squeezed into them, all mitigating evidence one way\nor another can be squeezed into them.\nMR. MARSHALL: That is correct, Your Honor.\nJurek was a facial challenge. But in Johnson and Graham\nthe Court made it pretty clear, I think, that as long as\nthe evidence is relevant in some way within those\nspecial issues, some mitigating way --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought in Johnson the\nonly question presented was age.\nMR. MARSHALL: In Johnson, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. MARSHALL: Youth was the central point\nof Johnson, but Graham involved youth and a distinctly\ntroubled childhood, much like we have in these cases.\nAnd so if that evidence was relevant within future\ndangerousness and did not amount to Eighth Amendment\nerror, then this evidence has to be just as relevant.\nAnd in fact we have another layer of analysis on top of\nthis because we are looking at the State court's\ndecision under AEDPA.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't see how this fits\nin the Graham package. The Graham is, this child came\nfrom a deprived background but managed to survive it,\nand he fits right into the category, he's not dangerous.\nLook at all the bad things that were done to him. He\nturns out not to be dangerous. Apart from this one\nmurder, he's been a good boy. That's not the picture in\neither of these cases.\nMR. MARSHALL: That's essentially the\npicture, Justice Ginsburg, in Brewer. That's exactly\nthe way counsel presented it to the jury. But not only\ndid counsel argue that he wasn't going to be dangerous\ndespite his childhood shortcomings, there was a\ndeliberateness definition submitted in the Brewer case,\nwhich is what this Court suggested in Penry in 1989\nmight remedy this problem. And so the court submitted a\ndefinition of deliberateness and counsel argued it to\nthe jury, that -- the definition was read to the jury,\ncounsel argued --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is that charge?\nMR. MARSHALL: It appears at page 90 of the\njoint appendix, Your Honor, and that's the Brewer joint\nappendix. Now counsel read that definition to the jury,\nand the definition reads as follows: \"A manner of doing\nan act characterized by or resulting from careful and\nthorough consideration characterized by awareness of the\nconsequences, willful, slow, unhurried and steady, as\nthough allowing time for a decision.\" Now counsel read\nthat definition to the jury during his closing argument.\nHe argued that Brewer's crime reflected poor planning\nand execution, that he was led into it by other actors,\nby his girlfriend Christy Nystrom, and that his\ncommitment to a mental hospital and his mental illness,\ndepression in this case, were argued specifically as\ncause for those faults. And so counsel related the\nevidence within that deliberateness instruction to the\njury, and that provided them with a significant vehicle\nto give effect to this evidence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that what the Penry\nCourt was talking about, something like what you just\nread?\nMR. MARSHALL: I think so, Your Honor, and\nthe Penry Court was not specific about what that\ndefinition should say, but this is certainly helpful to\nthe jury in this case and in taking account some of this\nevidence that was before it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you see, in Johnson\nthe Court was confronted with the special issues and it\nmakes the assumption based on the State's representation\nthere, that the special issues had enough latitude for a\njury to fully consider this. What has happened in these\ncases is that the prosecutors tell the jury, they keep\nreminding the jury you just must answer special issues\none and two as given. And in the Cole case they say,\neven though you felt maybe he had had a rough time as a\nkid, you still must put that out of the mind, of your\nmind, and just go by the special issues. And that's the\nconcern in these cases.\nMR. MARSHALL: That may be a concern,\nJustice Kennedy, but the Cole case provides a particular\nexample of how defense counsel countered that argument.\n75 percent of his argument, which is between pages 141\nand 144 of the Cole joint appendix, 75 percent of that\nargument is that Cole will burn out as he grows older,\nand that's based on the testimony of his experts. And\nhe says that burnout, that likeliness that he will not\nbe dangerous is a reasonable one.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's because the\nissues confined him to that.\nMR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Your Honor,\nbut that's a legitimate argument on the evidence here,\nand I think that it would be, it's difficult in my mind\nanyway to determine that the State court in reading\nGraham and Johnson could unreasonably determine that\nthat wasn't a good vehicle for the jury when he said,\nyou have a reasonable doubt about this man's\ndangerousness because of the testimony that we presented\nto you from his experts that said he wouldn't be\ndangerous in the future.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He's 30 years old, and\nthe testimony is 40, 50. It says, jury, for 10 years\nthis man is going to be walking in prison corridors and\nhe's going to be a danger for at least 10 years. And\nthat's an effective --\nMR. MARSHALL: Justice Ginsburg, that's\neasily as effective as the -- as youth was in Graham and\nJohnson. Youth is evidence that -- I mean, we don't\nknow how long it takes people to grow out of youth, but\ncertainly 10 years wouldn't be unreasonable under the\ncircumstances in that case. And so I don't see any\ndifference between youth and burnout in this context.\nWe are talking about a finite amount of time, we don't\nknow exactly what that amount of time is, but it's\ncertainly reasonable for a jury to give mitigating\neffect to it under that question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Marshall, I heard\nwhat you read from this charge, and I don't have the\nexact words of what the Court was talking about in\nPenry, but it did say a special instruction that would\nenable the jury who believed Penry committed the crime\ndeliberately, that he committed it deliberately, not\nslowly, whatever you just read, but also believed that\nhis background and diminished mental capacity diminished\nhis moral culpability, making the imposition of the\ndeath sentence unwarranted.\nSo what Penry said very clearly is yes, it's\ndeliberate, but you give them a charge that tells them\neven though it was deliberate, because of his abuse,\nbecause of his retardation, he is not morally culpable\nto the same extent as someone who doesn't have those\nimpairments. That's the instruction that Penry said\ncould be given and that would be okay under the\ndeliberateness. Quite different from the instruction\nyou read.\nMR. MARSHALL: It's different, Your Honor,\nbut I don't think it's that much different, and the\nreason is that this makes the crime a function of\nawareness of the consequences of slow unhurried\nconsideration of those consequences. And then counsel\nargues to the jury that Brewer is uncapable of engaging\nin that sort of premeditation because of his mental\nproblems, and so that's what reduces his culpability\nunder the circumstances. And I think if you combine the\nargument and the definition, which we were bound to do\nunder Boyde versus California, we're supposed to look at\nthe entire context of the trial here, that that meets\nthat suggestion in Penry for it. It's not exactly what\nthe Court suggested.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't there something\nabout moral culpability in what you read?\nMR. MARSHALL: No, Your Honor. It's not\nmentioned in this definition.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's what Penry makes\nclear, makes the distinction, between these are factors\nthat don't say he is that dangerous, don't say he didn't\nact deliberately, but they reduce or the jury may decide\nthat they reduce his moral culpability. And that's not\nwhat this charge was?\nMR. MARSHALL: This charge is different and\nyou're correct in that, Justice Ginsburg. However,\nfuture dangerousness also provides that vehicle in this\ncase, just the same as it did in Graham, and so -- and\nin Johnson. The Court said that this kind of evidence,\nthe evidence of a troubled childhood, could find effect\nwithin future dangerousness in some manner. And granted\nwe can conceive of other ways it might be relevant to\nculpability, but the Court explained -- and this was\nwhat the State court was working with at the time it\nconsidered this claim -- this Court explained that just\nbecause we can imagine other ways in which it might be\nrelevant doesn't mean that we have got Eighth Amendment\nerror. It's just important that the jury had some way\nof getting to it. And I don't see how this is markedly\ndifferent than the evidence that the Court said fit\nwithin future dangerousness in Graham.\nNow, in -- I think another thing that I need\nto mention about Cole is, is that my colleague noted the\nexpert testimony that Cole lacked impulse control. Now,\nI think the, the mitigating nature of that testimony in\nthis case becomes especially apparent when you realize\nthat, that Cole planned this crime 2 days in advance.\nHe planned to strangle this 66-year-old blind man 2 days\nbefore he did it. And so I don't think that an impulse\ncontrol problem mitigates his culpability for this crime\nin any way and I don't think any reasonable juror would\never see that. So I think that the mitigating\nsignificance of that evidence in this case is severely\ndiminished as opposed to the testimony that the jury\nheard in Penry, for example, which is that he'll never\nlearn from his mistakes, he had previously committed a\nrape, he didn't learn from it; this time he committed a\nmurder and a rape. And so the mitigating relevance of\nthat evidence was only aggravating within future\ndangerousness.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we, how does\nthat factor in on the issues that are before us, the\nweakness of the mitigating evidence? In what way are we\nsupposed to assess it? We don't have a harmless error\nquestion in these cases.\nMR. MARSHALL: There is no harmless error\nquestion, correct, Mr. Chief Justice. However, I think\nwhen we're looking at the Boyde standard, which is --\nand in Johnson -- a reasonable likelihood that the jury\nwas precluded from giving effect to the evidence, the\nreasonableness of that likelihood, the reasonableness of\nthat possibility, depends upon the way the juror, the\njury, heard the evidence and the relative strength of\nthat evidence.\nAnd so evidence of intoxication, for\nexample, while it does mitigate culpability in some\nmanner, would not create the reasonable possibility of\nEighth Amendment error in that sense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your argument is\nthat the mitigating evidence was not precluded by,\nreasonable consideration was not precluded by the\ninstruction; it was precluded by the fact that there\nwasn't much mitigating evidence to begin with?\nMR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Your Honor.\nBut in addition to all of that, the State court was\nlooking at Penry and Graham when they decided this case\nand there was no Penry II yet. There was no Tennard or\nSmith. And so it was reasonable for them to compare the\nevidence, the weight of that evidence, the strength of\nthat evidence, to those cases and decide that it fell on\nthe Graham and Johnson side of the line rather than the\nPenry side of the line. That's the only thing they\ncould do at the time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, do you think the\ncase should have been decided differently should it have\nbeen decided after those decisions?\nMR. MARSHALL: Well, Justice Stevens, if we\ntake into account the full effect language that gets\nquoted in Penry II, we might well have a different\nresult. But that wasn't the standard at the time and\nunder AEDPA --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But those decisions didn't\npurport to change the law.\nMR. MARSHALL: Well, under Teague they did\nnot purport to change the law. But I think AEDPA is a\ndifferent inquiry here. We're looking at what clearly\nestablished law was at the time the State courts made\ntheir decisions and not necessarily what, you know, what\nthe Teague inquiry would be. And so at that point I\nthink it's pretty clear under Graham and Johnson we're\nlooking at some effect. Whatever \"full effect\" means\nnow, it doesn't apply to these cases.\nAnd I think that gets to the main point\nhere. We're looking at an exceedingly ordinary fact\npattern in a capital murder case in both of these cases:\nDysfunctional childhoods, a small amount of abuse in\nBrewer, undescribed --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct, your\nposition essentially is that, while it may well be true\nthat these instructions did not permit the jury to give\nfull effect to this mitigating evidence, that was not\nclearly established law at the time of these decisions?\nMR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Justice\nStevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's your view.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Were these decisions\npost-Johnson.\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor. In fact,\nthe Brewer case was decided the year after Johnson and\nthe, the Cole case was decided in 1999. So the Court\nhad not held forth on what Penry meant in a long time at\nthat point. Graham and Johnson were the last clear\nstatements the Court had made.\nNow, I want to correct one misstatement by\nmy opposing counsel in Brewer. Brewer was -- there are\nthree distinct episodes of abuse that appear in the\nrecord in that case: That he was struck with a pistol\nby his father, he was struck with his fist, and struck\nwith a flashlight. He was never struck with a stick of\nfirewood, and that's on page 65 of the joint appendix.\nThat's pretty clear. This isolated abuse that occurred\nlate in life -- we don't know the exact time frame, but\nit could be as late as age 18 or 19 -- surely has\ndifferent characteristics in a jury's eyes than the\nevidence in Penry which, in which the defendant was beat\nand beat severely from a very young age, from his\ninfancy, and that beating, that abuse, caused brain\ndamage or mental retardation. The ordinary nature of\nthis evidence in comparison to the exceptional --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you suggesting that\nsome kind of a psychological expert would say that abuse\nas an adolescent is not as damaging as abuse as a young\nchild?\nMR. MARSHALL: I'm not suggesting that, Your\nHonor. I'm just suggesting that this is a smaller\namount of abuse than what was in Penry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess striking a big\nperson is not quite as bad as striking a little person.\nMR. MARSHALL: That may be true, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If the question is one of\nthe evidence was weak, why isn't that a harmless error\nquestion rather than a question of whether the jury can\ngive it effect?\nMR. MARSHALL: Well, there is, there is that\nreasonable likelihood standard built in under Boyde.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The likelihood of?\nMR. MARSHALL: Of constitutional error.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, constitutional error\nis --\nMR. MARSHALL: Is the reasonable likelihood\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. MARSHALL: Reasonable likelihood that\nthe juror was precluded from considering the relevant\nmitigating evidence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So if the\nevidence is very weak and if the instructions prevent\nyou from considering it, then it's precluded. But if\nthe evidence is very weak it didn't matter.\nMR. MARSHALL: Well, I think it's a\nreasonable reading of Graham and Johnson, though, Your\nHonor, that weak evidence does fit within these special\nissues. That's what those cases held. They said the\njury could consider the evidence in some manner and\ntherefore there was no reasonable likelihood that they\nwere precluded from doing so.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So imagine you're a juror\nand you think to yourself, I see all this stuff about\nthe childhood, frankly it doesn't move me so far as his\ndangerousness, I think he's dangerous, and I also think\nhe did it deliberately. And then you think to yourself,\nwell, could I consider it because it shows a bad\nchildhood and that is deserving of a life term? I'm not\nsure it shows me that, but can I consider it for that\npurpose at all? What's my answer under Texas law?\nMR. MARSHALL: Well, Your Honor, the State\ncourt considering this case was looking at Graham, in\nwhich the Court Stated that that evidence fit within\nfuture dangerousness.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I have gotten --\nI've finished considering it for future dangerousness.\nNo, it doesn't move me; he's dangerous. Now I say to\nmyself, can I consider it for the purpose of showing a\nbad childhood deserving of mercy, if you like? Can I\nconsider it for that purpose? What's the answer under\nState law?\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The answer is no.\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes, Justice Breyer, the\nanswer is yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The answer is yes?\nMR. MARSHALL: The answer is yes because\nthis Court said it was yes. This Court said that in\nGraham the jury was free to accept counsel's suggestion\nthat Graham's conduct was merely an aberration and that,\nand that he wouldn't do it again. That's exactly the\nway the case was argued to the jury by these two defense\nlawyers.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not talking about\nfuture dangerousness. I'm talking about -- I would be\nrepeating myself. You've taken that, I'm not talking\nabout future dangerousness. The jury's decided that\nmatter in your favor. I'm saying does Texas law allow\n-- you understood what I said, didn't you?\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, and the answer\nis yes, you can take it in to show mercy?\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what's the Texas case\nthat says that?\nMR. MARSHALL: Your Honor, it's not a Texas\ncase. It's this court in Graham and Johnson. This\nCourt said that evidence of a troubled childhood, of the\nparticular dysfunction that comes with youth, can be\ntaken as an aberration, that the person will not repeat\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, did we say that in\nthe case of all childhood, in cases, in every case of\nchildhood abuse and so forth?\nMR. MARSHALL: The question is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or was it really applied\njust in the context of the Graham evidence?\nMR. MARSHALL: Well, Your Honor, in these\ncases it's relevant for the same reasons it was in\nGraham. This evidence is not enough like Penry to\nwarrant relief.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. But the answer to\nJustice Breyer it seems to me has to be that you can\nonly consider it in the, in the context of\ndeliberateness or future dangerousness.\nMR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that depends on\nthe nature of the evidence, I take it? I mean, if the\nevidence we were talking about was biological\npredisposition to violence, that's only going to point\nin one direction, right? I mean, if the evidence is\nisolated incident, incidents of depression, the idea is\nthat, well, a juror might look at that and say, well,\nthat's why he did it, and that since it was isolated\nit's not likely to come up again and therefore it can be\nregarded as mitigating as well as aggravating.\nMR. MARSHALL: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so when you get\ninto this evidence of child abuse, I mean, how are we\nsupposed to decide if the evidence is sufficient so that\nanyone looking at it is going to say, he's only going to\ndo it again, or if someone who's looking at it is going\nto say, well, there's an excuse for it and he's going to\noutgrow it? Do we make that determination in every case\nbased on the particular evidence and the particular\narguments that counsel made?\nMR. MARSHALL: I don't think there's any\nother way to do it, Mr. Chief Justice. This Court has\ncontinually engaged in a case-specific analysis on a\ncase-by-case basis in these types, when granting these\ntypes of claims.\nIf the Court has no further questions --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Unless you take the view\nthat Penry took, which is you have to let the jury\ndistinguish between dangerousness and deliberate conduct\non the one hand and mitigation for mercy purposes that\ndon't tie in at all to dangerousness.\nMR. MARSHALL: That's because, Justice\nGinsburg, the Penry's evidence was relevant only in an\naggravating way to those issues. It suggested nothing\nother than the fact that he would be a future danger,\nand when the evidence is not so aggravating, when the\nevidence suggests, suggests that there is a mitigating\nanswer to the future dangerousness question, that the\nperson won't be a future danger because they're going to\nburn out or because this is an isolated incident, we\nhave a different situation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me, if you\nknow, how many cases in the Texas system, capital cases,\nare pending that were decided before the legislature\namended the instruction?\nMR. MARSHALL: Justice Kennedy, there are 47\ninmates on Texas death row that were sentenced under\nthis statute that remain there. There are nine cases\nwhich have litigated Penry claims all the way to\nconclusion in Federal court. There are 25 more that are\nsomewhere in the pipeline either in State court or\nFederal court. I've actually looked at the cases and 17\nof those cases, 17 of the 34 that are still in the\nsystem, have evidence that's almost identical to these\ncases.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that wasn't the\nquestion. Your question was how many were before or\nafter the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I take it your answer\nwas that all these were tried before Texas amended the\nstatute. Was it 1991 when it amended the statute?\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And all the cases you\nmentioned were tried before 1991.\nMR. MARSHALL: Yes. 47. 47 cases were\nsentenced under this pre-1991 statute.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I'd\nask that they affirm the judgment of the court below.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Marshall.\nYou Mr. Owen, have you 12 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. OWEN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. OWEN: I'd like to make two points about\nGraham since it's been a subject of some discussion.\nFirst is to remind the Court that Graham was a Teague\ncase. Graham was a case about whether the law in 1984,\nprior to Penry -- Mr. Graham's case became final on\ndirect appeal -- dictated the result that he was asking\nfor, which I think doesn't mean it has no persuasive\nimpact on these cases, but I certainly think it limits\nits precedential value outside the scope of the question\nof youth that Johnson later settled squarely.\nThe second thing I want to say about Graham\nis this is the State's brief in Graham, 91-7580, and I\nwant to just note that at page 26, squarely. This is\nthe State's brief in Graham 917580 and I want to note at\npage 26, footnote 8 the State says the insubstantiality\nof Graham's evidence of a troubled childhood is readily\napparent, which certainly suggests that there is a fair\nreading of the evidence in Graham of this background\nevidence as not being substantial, not being evidence\nabout abuse or mistreatment. The fact that he was moved\nfrom one relative to another because of the\ncircumstances in his family, in that case was not shown\nto have any negative impact on him. Whereas I think in\nMr. Cole's case certainly there is expert testimony that\nit had a very devastating negative impact on him. So\nGraham really does not even give the Court much guidance\non the question of troubled background because there is\nno indication that Graham actually had a, a background\nof mistreatment.\nBy the same token with respect to the\nState's comment or my brother's comment that the, the\nrecord doesn't bear out that Mr. Brewer was struck by\nhis father with a stick of firewood, that is correct.\nWhat the record actually says is, if I may quote from\nthe Brewer JA at page 90 -- 95 -- 65, excuse me: \"He\ntried to hit him with a stick of firewood. When he went\noutside to grab the firewood I --\" -- that's\nMr. Brewer's mother -- \"slammed the front door and\nlocked it, and he smashed the glass out of the front\ndoor with the firewood. That was the night I had him\narrested.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How old was Brewer\nat that time?\nMR. OWEN: I believe he was 15, Your Honor.\nBut I also want to, I also want to emphasize that I\nthink there, the fact is, the testimony is that\nMr. Brewer was hit numerous times. That's his mom's\nword. Hit with objects only twice, but hit numerous\ntimes. And I don't think the Court should also\nunderestimate the significance of the evidence that\nMr. Brewer saw his father brutalize his mother on many\noccasions, because that evidence too contributes. It's\nnot just the difference between being hit and watching\nsomeone else being hit. I think everyone understands\nthat there are enduring feelings of shame and guilt, and\nthat the teenage son feels --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the argument is\nthat the jury hearing this evidence in light of all the\ninstructions will only conclude that the evidence shows\nthat he will be violent again. They will not feel that\nthey can take it into account in any way to determine\nthat it's a situation in which they should extend mercy,\nor that, I guess it was, I get the Cole and the Brewer\nrecords confused here, but that this, the cause for the\nviolence will abate with, with age.\nMR. OWEN: I think, Your Honor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or that in, I guess\nin Brewer's case in particular, that since the violence\nwas caused by a particular bout of depression, that\nwould not necessarily recur.\nMR. OWEN: I, I don't think that's -- that's\nnot our argument, first, Your Honor, for this reason.\nThe court's question was, as I understand\nit, don't we have to show there is no way the jury could\nhave understood this evidence except as aggravating? I\ndon't think that's, I don't think that's the test. In\nTennard this Court said if the jury might well have\nconsidered the evidence as aggravating, then --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that was after --\nI guess the question would be under Johnson, whether or\nnot it could be considered in some manner.\nMR. OWEN: In some manner that is reasonable\nand that gives effect to the relevant mitigating\nqualities of the evidence. Yes, Your Honor. And I do\nthink that the, that the fact of Mr. Brewer's -- the\nfact that the jury knew that he had endured this\nmistreatment as a teenager could only have been given\naggravating effect. I don't think there is any way to\nreason from the premise that he was mistreated\nphysically and emotionally by his father when he was a\nteenager, to the conclusion that therefore he will be\nless dangerous in the future. That doesn't seem to me\nto be a reasonable connection.\nAnd I think that what the Court was calling\nfor in Johnson was that there be some sensible link\nbetween the proffered mitigating evidence and these\nnarrow questions, which as has been pointed out already\nwere the only options for the jury in this case. There\nwas no, there was no mercy option. There was no\nmitigation instruction. The jury was told solely these\ntwo -- these two special issues.\nWith respect to the Brewer argument that\nthere was a deliberateness instruction, I think Justice\nGinsburg has it exactly right in observing that in\nPenry, what the Court said was that to satisfy the, you\nknow, to fix the deficit in the former Texas special\nissues, a definition of deliberateness would have to\ndirect the jury's attention to the defendant's personal\nculpability. And I don't think this instruction does\nthat. This instruction directs them to the sort of\nquantity of forethought, how much did he think about it,\nhow long did he think about it, did he mull it over?\nBut I don't think that that captures the moral\nculpability aspect that Penry says is required under the\nEighth Amendment.\nIf the Court has further questions I'm happy\nto entertain them. Otherwise we would ask that the\nCourt grant our motions. In the alternative we would\nask that the Court reverse the judgments in both cases\nwith directions to reinstate the District Court's\nfavorable judgment in Mr. Brewer's case and to grant\nhabeas relief in Mr. Cole's case.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr. Owen.\n"
