        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 06-562, United States versus\nAtlantic Research Corporation.\nMr. Hungar.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn Section 113(f) of CERCLA, Congress\ncreated a precisely drawn detailed mechanism for\npotentially responsible parties to recover their\nresponse costs from other PRPs. Respondent seeks to\ncircumvent the limitations that Congress imposed on that\nremedy by manufacturing a parallel mechanism for\ncontribution-like relief under Section 107.\nRespondent's theory should be rejected because it\nviolates fundamental canons of statutory construction,\nrenders Section 113(f) superfluous, makes a mockery of\nthe textual limitations enforced by this Court in Cooper\nIndustries, and would frustrate Congress's clear intent\nto encourage settlements with the government in order to\nachieve supervised effective cleanups.\nRespondent essentially asks this Court to\ncreate a shadow contribution scheme under the guise of\nSection 107(a) by borrowing all of the features of the\nSection 113(f) remedy except the one that Respondent\ncan't satisfy, namely the requirement that contribution\nbe sought only during or following a civil action or\nsettlement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hungar, was this\nCourt wrong in your view, it wasn't dispositive of the\ncase in Key Tronic when it said, \"Section 107\nunquestionably provides a cause of action for private\nparties to seek recovery of cleanup costs?\"\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, we agree that\nSection 107(a)(1) through (4)(b), subparagraph (b)\ncreates a cause of action for private parties, in\nparticular the private parties who are not PRPs, who are\ntherefore other persons other than the PRPs who are the\nsubject of that statutory sentence. So we agree in that\nsense. We don't think it creates a cause of action for\nthe particular private parties who are trying to sue in\nthis case, that is PRPs.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you think that when\nthe Court says this, it didn't contemplate that PRPs\nwould be included among private parties?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, in Key Tronic, obviously\nthe Court was facing a different question so I don't\nthink it was trying to in any way authoritatively\nresolve this issue, as the Court held in Cooper\nIndustries. But I -- certainly there is language in\nCooper -- excuse me, in Key Tronic that can be read to\nsuggest that the Court assumed or thought there was some\nsort of remedy for PRPs. It's not clear whether it was\nreferring to contribution or some other remedy. But in\nCooper Industries, the Court made clear that that was\ndicta and that's in our view correct, because the Court\nin Key Tronic was faced with a different question\naltogether.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Who were the PRPs, or who\nare the individuals other than PRPs who are likely to,\nto avail themselves to the cause of action under Section\n7? That's one of the problems I have. I mean, it's got\nto be someone other than owners of the land now, owners\nof the land then. I mean, who's going to bring these\nactions?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, people who are -- who are\nexcluded by other provisions of Section 107 from the\ncategory of liable parties would be entitled to bring\nsuch an action if they don't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But can you give me an idea\nof generally --\nMR. HUNGAR: A city that cleans up a site\nand that is not itself --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's not -- you know,\nthat's not a private party within the meaning of the\nquotation.\nMR. HUNGAR: No, it is, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Pardon?\nMR. HUNGAR: It is, because a city can't sue\nunder subparagraph (a). Only the State can sue.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's not the United\nStates of America, but we wouldn't normally refer to it\nas a private party. And -- but I don't mean to get tied\nup in that, but can you think of any individuals or\ncorporations who are not likely to come in to one of the\nfour categories in 7 who would, who would take advantage\nof this?\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. And first of\nall, just let me make clear: Subparagraph (b) doesn't\nrefer to private parties only; it says any other person.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No I realize that. I'm\ntrying to --\nMR. HUNGAR: But with respect to private\nparties in particular, any private party who was a\nso-called innocent person under the statute, who because\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. Those are people who\nwould have a defense under the later sections of --\nsubsections of Section 7. They are still people who\nwould fall within the first four categories.\nMR. HUNGAR: I think, Your Honor, that you\nhave to read the statutory sentence in Section 107(a) as\na whole, and what it says is that the people in these\ncategories, owners, operators, arrangers and so forth,\ncollect in the conjunctive, shall be liable for -- and\nthen under (b), any other necessary cost or response\nincurred by any other person.\nAnd that the other provisions of the statute\nsuch as subparagraph (b) with respect to the third party\ndefense, subparagraph (d), subparagraphs that create --\nI mean, I'm sorry, subsections that create various\ndefenses, what they say is if you satisfy this defense,\nyou're not liable. You are taken out of the category of\nliable parties, the category that is the subject of this\nstatutory sentence. And therefore in our view, you\nbecome an other person. So people who are able to\nsatisfy the defenses are other persons, and that's what\nthe lower courts have held in cases where this has come\nup.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you know that when\nthey go into court. Let's assume they bring the action\nand the answer is well, you fall into one of the\ncategories one through four, and the person says oh, but\nI -- I'm not liable because ultimately I will have an\ninnocent party defense. Would we then have a collateral\ntrial on the innocent party defense in -- in the cause\nof action for, for reimbursement?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I don't think it's a\ncollateral trial. It's just one of the issues in the\ncase.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I mean if that would be\nthe first issue, we'd have to try the innocence of the\nperson who was bringing the action?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I think the court could\nobviously structure the issues as it saw fit but\ncertainly that would be one the issues in the case, but\nagain people in that category aren't the only --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well the -- the trouble\nwith having, I mean the trouble with that approach is\nthat whatever you, whatever may be the ultimate effect\nof subsection (b) is referred to as defenses. And the\nway you're using it the so-called defenses would be an\n-- an affirmative element in the action for, for, for\ncost reimbursement with is just -- and I mean it\ncertainly at the least would involve a very odd language\nusage in the statute.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well I don't think so because\nwhat the statute says is people, the people who are the\nsubject of the sentence shall be liable to other\npersons. And if someone by virtue of the statute is\nrendered not liable --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- they are not in the\nsubject; they are in the other category.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well you've glided\nover the great difficulty which is it doesn't say that\npeople identified in the statute shall be liable to\nother persons. It says they will be liable to, under\ncertain circumstances, the United States, a State or an\nIndian tribe and they are liable for -- for other costs\nincurred by any other person. And it just seems that\nthe most natural reading of that construction is that\nthe other refers to other than the United States or a\nState or an Indian tribe.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, that would\ncertainly be a -- a permissible reading of the statute,\nwere it not for the other \"other.\" The -- the statute\nin subparagraph (b) refers to any, provides a cause of\naction or refers, really imposes liability for any\n\"other\" necessary costs. The other necessary costs --\nthat other, the only other costs that that \"other\" can\nrefer to are the costs of governmental entities, the\nUnited States and the States and Indian tribes under\nsubparagraph (a). So the first other in subparagraph\n(b) makes clear that it's not talking about the\nsubparagraph (a) claims; it's talking about other\nclaims, because by definition the United States or a\nState cannot recover under (b) by virtue of the first\nother.\nCongress in the development of this\nlanguage, the first other was already in the statutory\nlanguage. Congress, at the last minute there was a\nchange, a compromise in order to get the bill passed and\nreduce the onerousness of its provisions, and they added\nthe second other. The only logical explanation and the\nonly way to give effect to the second other is to\nconstrue it as we do.\nJUSTICE ALITO: In the years since CERCLA\nwas enacted have there been any real cases in which a\nparty that you would regard as an innocent party has\nbrought a cost recovery action?\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, sir. And actually there's\nan annotation that, that collects the cases. We haven't\ndone an exhaustive survey, but certainly the annotation\nis -- which is at 12 A.L.R. F.2d 161 -- collects a\nnumber of such cases. And the lower courts have\naddressed these questions and have, and adjudicated them\nso this is not a novel suggestion. And it's one that\nhas arisen because, because remember, under the well\nestablished law of every circuit that had addressed the\nquestion prior to the Cooper Industries decision, a PRP\ncould not sue solely under Section 107(a). They had to\nsue, they had to comply with the, the Section 113\nmechanism, and the courts held that in order to avoid\nthe disastrous consequences that would ensue if\nrespondents or the court of appeals --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What are -- what are they?\nI mean as I read this, I can't get anything out of the\nlanguage. I mean the two \"others\" might just make it\nmore clear. So we have another Section 113 that talks\nabout contribution and it says you can get contribution\nif there has been a lawsuit, and so forth, or if there\nhas been a settlement. Fine.\nNow the question comes up, well, suppose\nthere hasn't been a lawsuit or a settlement. Now if we\nlook at the language here, at least my initial reading\nof it, it does not say. It says that they are liable.\nThese PRPs are liable to this other PRP or person there.\nBut it doesn't just say explicitly bring a suit, and it\ndoesn't say explicitly you can't bring a suit.\nSo I think well, why can't he bring a suit?\nIf he brings a suit how is the sky to fall? On the\nother hand, if you don't let him bring a suit, they say\nwell, maybe the Government just -- will just stay out of\nthis. The Government won't enter into settlements\nbecause the Government is a big polluter. And it would\nnot like to get sued often, so they will stay away from\nthe settlement and be home free.\nSo that's what they say on your -- on their\nside, I think, primarily. What do you say on your side?\nHow will the sky fall if in fact they win and they can\nbring suits under 107?\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, the sky will fall\nbecause under that interpretation PRPs can evade the\nsettlement bar that Congress enacted in order to\nencourage settlement, and Congress's clear goal in\nproviding a contribution remedy and providing an\nexplicit opportunity for PRPs to sue was to encourage\nsettlement with the Government. Congress wanted to\nreduce litigation, encourage settlement and Government\nsupervised cleanups, and so it created the settlement\nbar in Section 113(f)(2), which, if a PRP settles with\nthe Government, the United States or a State, settles\nfor a response cost liability, it then has a\ncontribution action to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does it work with \"or\na State\" because I thought that there was some\nsuggestion that States, they don't want to bother with\nthe Federal legislation, so they'll say you're okay\nunder the State legislation. You can't force a State to\n-- to take on that responsibility.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, Your Honor in our view\nwhat Section 113(f)(3)(b), the settlement contribution\nprovision, requires is that a State settle, the parties\nsettle with the State and resolve its liability to the\nState for response costs which is a defined term under\nCERCLA.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The States, we have a\nbrief from the States telling us look, we don't want to\nput our money on that kind of thing. We've got very\nhigh-risk sites and we want to spend our resources\nmaking sure those are cleaned up.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, Your Honor, every State\nhas a voluntary cleanup program which encourages parties\nto settle, and under many of those programs there is an\nopportunity if they do the settlement to required\nstandards to obtain a discharge of liability from the\nState for response costs. And there is no reason why\nthose settlement agreements can't be written and they\noften are.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they -- they can.\nOf course they can but the States are telling us that\nthis puts a burden on them that they don't want.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, the States already\nhave these programs in existence. There is no reason\nwhy the settlement language can't be written\nappropriately and moreover, in many States, I suspect\nmost States, the PRPs are required to pay the costs of\nthe State that it incurs in monitoring and in ensuring\nthat the settlement agreement is appropriate. The State\nof Washington, for example, which is here today, if you\nlook at the web site of its Department of Ecology, it\nhas extensive procedures, extensive opportunities for\nparties to come to the State, present the information,\nobtain a settlement if they want -- if they will pay the\nState's costs in monitoring and making sure that what\nthe PRP is doing is an appropriate cleanup. And that's\nwhat CERCLA should encourage. There are --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's just go back\nto Justice Breyer's question, because it was I think a\nmajor point of the Eighth Circuit. That is, they said\nthe United States, the United States is a big polluter,\ncould avoid its own responsibility by not bringing any\nenforcement action and by not settling, and you -- you\nsaid there would be a disincentive for the PRP -- a\ndisincentive to settlement, but you didn't answer the\nquestion of why wouldn't the United States when it is a\npolluter and it would be responsible on this site, to\nsay well, we are going to, we are not going to settle?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, two -- two responses.\nNumber one of course, if that happened, there is always\nthe State option, the States settled thousands of cases.\nNumber two, that's just not the way it works in\npractice. EPA has the enforcement authority with\nrespect to these private, the private sites that we are\ntalking about. EPA has no incentive not to do its job\nand every incentive to do its job.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what about the --\nwhat about the statement in the red brief that -- that\nthere is presently in existence a directive that EPA not\nproceed against any Federal agency?\nMR. HUNGAR: I -- I think what Your Honor is\nreferring to is a directive perhaps that requires EPA to\nobtain the Attorney General's approval before it will\nissue a unilateral administrative order. But that\ndoesn't apply to Section 107, excuse me, Section 106(1)\nconsent orders the, the EPA issues. It enters into\nnumerous settlement agreements in cases implicating\nFederal PRPs; we cited a number in our brief and there\nare many more, and -- and EPA has a detailed set of\nstandards. They occupy a hundred pages.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, excuse me. Are cases\nthat you referred to cases in which EPA has gone against\na -- we'll say a third party polluter, but the\nGovernment is also involved?\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes. We cite a number from the\nFederal Register.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Now, has EPA during\nthe pendency of that directive gone directly against any\nFederal agency?\nMR. HUNGAR: If Your Honor means filing a\nlawsuit the answer is no --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No.\nMR. HUNGAR: -- because in our view EPA\ncan't sue the United States. If Your Honor means, I\nmean definitely there are enforcement actions or --\nproceeding. The way EPA normally works, just to be\nclear, is that when it learns of a site, it learns of a\nrelease of hazardous materials, it does a preliminary\nassessment to find out whether this is a problem or not,\nwhether it's a problem that they should pay attention to\nor if they should instead refer to the State. And if\nit's of sufficient magnitude that it's for the EPA\nrather than the State to deal with, they proceed to\nidentify all the PRPs they can sent notices to them and\nattempt to settle.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right --\nMR. HUNGAR: They always do that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if, what if one of the\nPRPs they so identify is the Department of Defense?\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes. They attempt to settle,\nthey attempt to settle with the Department of Defense as\nwell as --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do they have to get the\nAttorney General's approval before doing that? Before\nnaming the Department of Defense?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, they wouldn't sue them.\nIf you mean by sending notice to the Department of\nDefense --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: However they initiate, I\ndon't know as a matter of procedure how they initiate\nenforcement action --\nMR. HUNGAR: They send a letter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's by that letter --\nMR. HUNGAR: They send a letter to all\nPRPs.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do they need the Attorney\nGeneral's approval to send the letter?\nMR. HUNGAR: I'm not sure. I don't believe\nso, but I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if, what the\nDepartment of Defense says \"nothing doing\"? What does\nEPA do then?\nMR. HUNGAR: They would -- if, if the\nprivate parties are willing to settle and pay, and take\nresponsibility for their share of the liabilities, EPA\ncan and will settle with them, regardless.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what does it do about\nthe Department of Defense?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In my hypo, the Department\nof Defense says you know, we are not talking with you.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, number one the Department\nof Defense has additional legal obligations to deal with\nhazardous waste even beyond anything EPA can do.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe it does. But let's\njust talk about EPA. What does EPA do in the case that,\nwhen Defense stonewalls?\nMR. HUNGAR: Just, just to be -- just to\nfinish my last point, if I may -- which can be enforced\nby citizen suits.\nBut leaving that point aside, if --\nultimately they would go to the Attorney General I\nsuppose and ask for authority to issue a unilateral\norder. But I'm not aware that that problem is a\nsignificant one, and the fact is there are numerous\nsettlements, and they don't, under -- under -- for\nRespondent to have a cause of action, EPA doesn't have\nto settle with the Federal PRP; all they have to do is\nsettle with the private PRP, and if the private PRP is\nwilling to pay its share, which EPA determines according\nto standards about its -- vary, considering various\nfactors about who contributed what and who caused which\nportion of the problem --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And at that point 113 would\nkick in --\nMR. HUNGAR: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- regardless of Defense?\nMR. HUNGAR: Correct. And again if EPA\nsomehow refused to settle, the -- they could settle with\nthe State. So it's just not -- EPA does not have any\nincentive to block cleanups. EPA wants to encourage\ncleanups and if the best way to get the cleanup done is\nto settle with a private party, then that's what EPA is\ngoing to do.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why this case --\nthere's a point that was made by the Eighth Circuit, and\nalso in the States' brief on page 24, and that is that\nthe EPA was engaged in settlement negotiations with\nAtlantic Research, and then after this Court decided\nCooper Industries that negotiation terminated.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, that's not correct.\nMy understanding is that the negotiations were between,\nwere -- Atlantic Research brought a claim seeking,\nseeking money from essentially the Defense Department,\nand my understanding was that the negotiations were only\nto settle Atlantic Research's claim whether you call it\na contribution or a cost recovery claim, not an attempt\nby Atlantic Research to resolve its liability to the\nUnited States. They were not negotiating with EPA with\nrespect to EPA's enforcement authority. They are\nnegotiating with Justice Department lawyers in the\nenvironmental defense section who represent Federal PRP\ndefendants. They weren't -- they weren't trying to\nresolve their liability in order to give rise to a\ncontribution claim. What they were trying to do was\nmerely make the United States pay them without first\nhaving resolved their own liability, which is why it\nmakes no sense for them to be bringing a contribution\nclaim.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I -- can I go back?\nBecause I'm trying to, since I do find it so open with\nthe language, what I'm doing is making what I call the\nlist of acorns. You say the sky is falling and I want a\ncomparative list.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes. Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: On their side I have an\nacorn, which is if they don't win, EPA and DOD just are\nnot going to settle these things because they want to\nescape us suing them. And you say, are you kidding?\nEPA loves to sue.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they like to settle.\nDon't worry about it. All right.\nOn your side, you're saying well, you know,\nif we don't -- if we don't -- accept your\ninterpretation, they won't enter into settlements. To\nwhich I guess they will make the same response. Are you\nkidding? The EPA loves to sue us and we are frightened\nof them and we'll settle.\nOkay. So I've got one acorn each side, now\nare there other acorns on the Government side; namely\nthe sky is falling --\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What are they? I'd just\nlike to make the whole list of acorns.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, the first and foremost\nway in which the sky is falling is that the court of\nappeals approach, Respondent's approach would eviscerate\nthe settlement bar, because the whole point of the\nsettlement bar is to give parties an incentive to settle\nwith the Government knowing that they will be protected\nfrom contribution claims. But if Respondent has a cost\nrecovery claim under Section 107, the settlement bar\ngoes out the window. And in fact that's what a number\nof the courts of appeals have held in -- in making clear\nthat Section 113 does govern these claims. EPA has\nentered into settlements with literally tens of\nthousands of PRPs.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you have to pay the\ncosts. I mean, isn't that something of a disincentive?\nBefore you can sue?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, but the claim here is\nthat the parties want to pay the costs and incur\nvoluntary cleanup costs anyway. They just don't want to\nsettle first. So if I'm understanding your question --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. It would be one thing\nif you skip away from a settlement without having to pay\nany money. But in order to come under, under 9607, they\nhave to, they have to shell out the money.\nMR. HUNGAR: Maybe I'm not understanding.\nMy point, Your Honor, is that there are tens of\nthousands of parties who have already settled, shelling\nout some money or not, with the EPA in reliance on the\nunanimous view of the courts of appeals that PRPs could\nnot sue them because the contribution bar protected\nthem, Section 113(f) would protect them.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how sure are\nyou -- how sure are you that it doesn't protect them\nstill?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, Your Honor, what it\napplies to is contribution claims, and respondent and\nRespondent's amici are very clear that they want is not\na contribution claim because they recognize that the\nsettlement bar would preclude their claims, but a cost\nrecovery claim, and Section 113(f)(2) says\n\"contribution,\" not \"cost recovery.\" Those are very\nclearly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, when one\nresponsible party has paid out the cost and is seeking a\ncost recovery claim from another responsible party, it's\nnot too much of a stretch to call it a contribution\nclaim, is it?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, Your Honor, if you want\nto call what the PRP is seeking a contribution claim,\nthen we submit that it should be governed by the\ntraditional understanding of contribution and by\nCongress's explicit terms defining what it wants\ncontribution claims to be. Even if you assume that in\nsome sense Section 107 imposes liability on PRPs to\nother PRPs, it doesn't say what to do with that\nliability and how you litigate it. Section 113(f) is\nhow Congress explicitly, carefully addressed that\nquestion and when Congress has done so this Court\nnormally assumes that what Congress specifically said as\nthe remedy and delineated as the remedy, including the\nlimitations thereon, are what apply.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not worried\nabout any of that when you're dealing with an innocent\nparty, the person you say can bring this action under\n107(4)(b). Don't all those same concerns and objections\napply in that case as well?\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, because the\nnormal rule in American law is that innocent victims get\nto sue the people who have injured them for recovery,\nbut the defendants, the liable parties, don't get to sue\neach other except in contribution when it has been made\navailable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't know,\nyou don't know, that you're dealing with an innocent\nparty until the end of the litigation.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, that might be true in\nmany circumstances, Your Honor. But that doesn't mean\nthat we don't give someone who can establish they are\ninnocent party a right to full recovery and someone who\nis not an innocent party is relegated to contribution.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have another\nexample of an innocent party who can bring an action\nunder 107(4)(b) other than a governmental subdivision?\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. A party who\nqualifies, who can show that under the third party\ndefense the hazardous release was not due to any, any\nfault of their own, and can satisfy the requirements of\nthat defense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they're somehow\naffected by the hazardous release.\nMR. HUNGAR: I'm sorry?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they're still\nsomehow affected by the hazardous release.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, yes. They could be a\nsubsequent owner, for example, under the bona fide\npurchaser exemption or the third party exemption.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But my point is that\nsubsequent owner, EPA is going to start looking at him\nas a PRP, not as an innocent party. In other words,\nthere is going to have to be an awful lot of litigation\nbefore he can establish that he is not a PRP and is\ninstead an innocent, innocent party.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, they could also just\nresolve it through settlement, Your Honor. And either\nthey could then proceed with their lawsuit or, if they\nwant to admit some minimal liability and obtain a\ncontribution claim, they could proceed in that fashion.\nBut there are solutions to the problems that have been\nidentified under our interpretation, but there is no\nplausible solution to the problems that their\ninterpretation produce, including eviscerating the\nsettlement bar. It's no surprise that some of the\nlargest polluters in America have lined up in support of\nthis view, because this will allow them to reopen\nsettlements and go after parties who thought they had\npaid up their liability and obtained settlement\nprotection by virtue of the Section 113(f) settlement\nbar.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The person who settled,\nwouldn't that person be protected? Wouldn't the court\nsay, this person has made a bargain with the EPA and\nwe're not going to extract any more from them?\nMR. HUNGAR: Not if the claim is a cost\nrecovery claim under Section 107, because section -- the\nsettlement bar applies only to claims for contribution.\nThis is Section 113(f)(2), which appears on page 9a of\nthe appendix to our brief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but to make the\nstatute work in harmony, to harmonize 107 with 113, it\nseems to me that would be an altogether reasonable\nposition for a court to take. If someone has settled\nand is protected by virtue of that settlement, then when\nsomeone else tries to go after that same person the\ncourt could say: We have to make the statute work and\nwe're going to honor the settlement.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, I submit if the\ncourt were seeking go harmonize Sections 113 and 107 the\nway to do it would be to give effect to the limitations\nthat Congress imposed on PRP remedies, but not merely\nthe settlement bar, but also the requirement that\nactions be brought during or following civil actions and\nsettlements, and also the statute of limitations, which\nthe Respondent's theory would also permit them to evade.\nIf I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of\nmy time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Hungar.\nMr. Armstrong.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF OWEN T. ARMSTRONG, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ARMSTRONG: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to address the settlement bar.\nOne thing that the Court should keep in mind is that a\ncost recovery action under 107(a)(4)(B) is an action for\nrestitution. This is an equitable action. There is no\njury trial under CERCLA. The district court is sitting\nas a court of equity. And as Justice Ginsburg just\npointed out, the court is empowered in any case, any\n107(a)(4)(B) case, to accord settlement protection to a\nsettling party as a matter of equity. It may do that\nsimply as a matter of equity or, as we pointed out in\nour brief, it may do so by virtue of a contribution\ncounterclaim by the settling party.\nSo the court, a district court, is empowered\nto give full protection to any party who has settled so\nlong as the matters addressed a portion of 107 --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How? I'm not so sure\nbecause -- unless you want to stipulate that that\nrestitution -- if you want us to write in the opinion\nthat in fact in a 107 action if one of the parties sued\nhas entered into a settlement he shall have precisely\nthe same protection from suit as if it were a 113\naction. Do you want to say that or not?\nMR. ARMSTRONG: Well, Your Honor, I believe\nthe district court as a matter of equity should accord\nin most cases -- now there may be exceptions --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I would worry about\nthe equity. I just want to know if you want to\nstipulate that that's the proper interpretation, because\nI could easily imagine a case where your client bought a\nbeautiful golf course and he wants to turn it into a\ngolf course. Unfortunately, there's a little mess under\nthere and he spends $10 million on that. And he says\nthe real fault is the Union Oil Company and I'm going to\nsue them because they're the ones who dumped this and\nthey've cost me $9 million. And it turns out that Union\nthrough precisely good luck and a brilliant attorney has\nsettled this very matter for one dollar with EPA.\nBarred?\nMR. ARMSTRONG: No, Your Honor, it would not\nbe barred in that case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah, that's what I thought,\nand that's what he's saying. That's what he's saying,\nthat's why he has brought his second acorn, because he\nsaid there's a huge difference here. What you will do\nis if you get this 107 action you'll argue to the court\nas to what's fair, but what 113 says is once you settle\nwith the Federal Government you're home free.\nMR. ARMSTRONG: Well, Your Honor, in your\nhypothetical, spending one dollar, there is no question\nthat the court sitting in equity and also as a matter of\na contribution counterclaim would be entitled to review\nthe settlement and if that matter is in the matters\naddressed, if it has been resolved by the Government --\nand I should point out that in a settlement, settlements\nare publicly noticed, so parties have an opportunity to\nobject to any settlement which they feel is unfair. And\npresumably our golf course owner would be identified in\nthat circumstance.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there's\nnothing, there's nothing unnecessarily unfair. It turns\nout that the Union Oil Company is bankrupt and in part\nof the settlement they agreed to turn over all the\ndocuments listing whoever it was that gave them the\nchemicals. And it's a very complicated thing because\nwe're dealing with people often in these cases that\ndon't have assets and only limited responsible parties\nhave the assets. So they're trying to recover what they\ncan from the others.\nMR. ARMSTRONG: That is correct, Your Honor.\nThat would not be unfair any more than it would be\nunfair in a contribution action, in which case the court\nis directed to apply principles of equity in allocating\nresponsibility.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, almost by definition\na settlement is for the full amount that you'd have to\nspend without the settlement, almost by definition.\nMR. ARMSTRONG: Well, that is correct, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You don't usually settle\nfor 100 percent of your liability.\nMR. ARMSTRONG: That is correct, and I think\nCongress did write that into the contribution part of\nthe statute --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So that means that in\nevery settlement agreement you'd have to engage in this\nanalysis to see whether or not it was fair.\nMR. ARMSTRONG: Well, I believe in every\nsettlement agreement the court would have to engage in\nan analysis as to what matters addressed are for\npurposes of the settlement.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How are you going to choose\nthis? Because he is, I think you're -- maybe you're in\na slightly awkward position because the Government is\nsaying that one of the reasons that you're stuck with\n113 is because Congress didn't really want through 107\nto give parties like your clients an opportunity to\nreview for fairness or equitable principles, whatever\nyou like, the settlements that had taken place with the\ndefendant in EPA. And that's so we can get people to\nsettle, among other things. They feel they're home\nfree.\nNow, you have two choices here. I think you\ncould say, one, well, that's the way it is, we should\nhave a 107 action and we should review these settlements\nfor fairness; or two, you could say one of the\nprinciples of fairness is the principle that's written\ninto 113 about no review, and we're happy with reading\nthat into 107. So which is it that you would like to\nsay?\nMR. ARMSTRONG: Well, Your Honor, that's\nabsolutely true, because I think one of the principles\nof fairness is to solidify the settlement agreement.\nJUSTICE BREYER: When you say that's\nabsolutely true, you mean absolutely true that you have\nthat choice, or is it --\nMR. ARMSTRONG: I believe that a reviewing\ncourt should in each instance -- if a district court\ndecides to avoid the settlement, if it says that it's\nnot fair, I believe that would undercut the finality of\na settlement so long as it's contained within the\nmatters addressed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, so then he's\nwrong in thinking that the motivating force behind this\naction is to permit people to get equitable review of\nprior settlements? What you simply want -- and you're\nnot interested in that; you'll go with no equitable\nreview of private settlements. Read 113 into it. You\nwant the right to bring the case where there has no\nsettlement and Government has done nothing.\nMR. ARMSTRONG: That is absolutely correct\nin our case, Your Honor, and I think we've stipulated to\nthat.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But to talk about the\nother polluter or the other in this case, where the\nother polluter is not someone who is going to settle\nbecause it's the Government itself --\nMR. ARMSTRONG: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So I don't think you're\nin a position to concede anything one way or another\nbecause that's not your case.\nMR. ARMSTRONG: That is correct, Your Honor,\nbecause in our case, I think as we have made it quite\nclear, all we are seeking in this case is to recover a\nproportion of our response costs. We cannot conceive,\nbecause we are not confronted with the issue that has\nbeen posed -- I would not object as a matter of a bright\nline rule if the Court were to rule that a settlement is\nprotected from a back end or a roundabout 107(a)(4)(B)\naction in order to disturb a settlement agreement. We\ndo not have those circumstances in this case, that is\ncorrect. And we are only seeking restitution in our\ncase. We are seeking an equitable result, a\nproportionate share of ARC's response costs.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the\nGovernment's concern that prenups shouldn't go on\nunsupervised. That's when EPA brings an enforcement\naction, there's a monitor there. When there's a\nsettlement, then the Government is there. But if you\njust go off on your own and do this, you're doing it\nunsupervised by any State authority, any Federal\nauthority, and that could --\nMR. ARMSTRONG: Your Honor, I believe in\nmost cases there is State involvement. There is in the\nARC case, although it is not in the record. We have\nentered into a cooperative relationship with the State\nin cleaning up the site. And I think in almost every\ncase a PRP is well advised to bring in experts to make\nsure that the cleanup is consistent with the national\ncontingency plan, because absent that, satisfying that\nrequirement, the PRP is not entitled to recover any of\nits costs. So there is a very demanding requirement\nwritten into CERCLA. The national contingency plan\noccupies 9605 and it occupies several hundred pages of\n40 C.F.R. part 300.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As you read the\nstatute, you're talking about a PRP, but any other\nperson doesn't have to be a PRP, does it?\nMR. ARMSTRONG: No, Your Honor. That is\ncorrect, although --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You could set up a\ncompany that cleans up these sites, right, and go\ntraveling around the country and clean them up and then\nsend people a bill and cite your reading of 1074(b),\nright?\nMR. ARMSTRONG: 107(a)(4)(B) would include\nboth PRPs and what we might call non-PRPs. I believe\none of the amicus parties studies 364 cases between the\nyears of 1995 and 2000 and there was one case out of\nthat 364 that involved precisely your hypothetical, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if we rule in\nyour favor presumably there will be a lot more, right?\nMR. ARMSTRONG: PRPs will certainly be able\nto seek cost recovery under 107(a)(4)(B).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about non-PRPs?\nMR. ARMSTRONG: There are very few non-PRPs.\nThe only non-PRPs that I can think of is perhaps the\nhypothetical you just advanced, because as has been\npointed out, the so-called innocent adjoining landowner\nis a PRP, is a covered person under 107(a)(4)(b), and\nonly has a defense to liability. And it is absolutely\ntrue that in order to bring an action, according to the\nGovernment, that particular PRP would have to establish\nthrough affirmative action that it's -- that it\nsatisfies the, the liability exclusion in 107(b). And\nthat is a very drawn out process. The criteria for\nsatisfying the defense in 107(b) takes up 2 1/2 pages of\nthe, of the statute.\nSo what we are involved in in that case,\nYour Honor, is yes, PRPs may bring cost recovery\nactions. And I think that was true in 1980 when the\nstatute was passed. Contrary to the Government's\nrepresentation, there are 10 cases holding that actions\nmay be brought under 107(a)(4)(b) by so-called PRPs\nbetween the time that CERCLA was passed in 1980 and the\namendment to CERCLA in 1986, in October of 1986. Courts\nheld without exception, without exception, that covered\npersons or PRPs indeed do have a right to bring a cost\nrecovery action under 107(a)(4)(b).\nAnd Congress when it passed 113, was looking\nat those cases only that had some doubt about whether\ncontribution could also be brought. In other words,\nwhether a party could seek restitution despite the fact\nthat it was compelled to do a cleanup via a lawsuit.\nAnd some courts found that there was an implied right to\ncontribution, some found that there was a common law\nright, but Congress in 1986 specifically said, we are\nonly concerned with the implied right to contribution,\ngiven this Court's holding in the Northwest Airlines\ncase and in Texas Industries. Congress was concerned\nthat there would be no right to contribution unless it\ncodified that right, which it did in 1986. And I think\nthe legislative history makes it quite clear that\nCongress did not intend to disturb or to cut back on the\nrights that courts had found consistently in that\nsix-year window between 1980 and 1986, all of which held\nthat PRPs indeed do have a right to bring cost recovery\nactions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But in -- in response to\nyour -- going back to your response to Justice Breyer, I\ntake it the -- the right under -- under 107 was affected\nto the extent, or at least you would agree that it was\naffected to the extent that if there is a settlement\nthey are home free and there can't be a 107 action; is\nthat correct?\nMR. ARMSTRONG: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So it disturbed the\nold scheme to that extent.\nMR. ARMSTRONG: It did, although most of\nthese cases I do believe did not involve settlements,\nbut I think obviously when Congress enacted 113, I think\nit certainly wanted to encourage settlements in cases\nwhere there had been an action brought against a PRP.\nObviously I think settlement saves everybody the time\nand effort of litigating these matters, and I think for\nthat reason, in 113 we get contribution protection, we\nget the ability to bring a contribution action. So\ncertainly settlement was a key element of 113 but it was\na key element of that provision, not Section 107. But I\nthink Congress has made it quite clear to encourage\nsettlements, if it's in the matters addressed, that\nthere should be immunity for those parties that are\nsettling their claims with the Government or a State in\na judicially approved or administratively approved\nsettlement. So I don't believe --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the\ndisincentive to settlement? You just said how important\nsettlement was, or what a good thing it is to encourage\nit. But the Government says if you could just clean up\nwithout any order and without making any proposed\nsettlement, just do it and get back your costs, then\nthere's a powerful disincentive to settle.\nMR. ARMSTRONG: Well, Your Honor, I think\nonce again, settling is not a disincentive in the sense\nthat if you do settle, you are deemed -- all of your\ncosts are deemed to be consistent with the national\ncontingency plan. You need not be concerned in that\nparticular case about satisfying the burden of proof\nthat you have as a PRP that your costs are consistent\nwith the national contingency plan, which is no easy\nmatter. The national contingency plan as I stated,\nappearing in 40 C.F.R., part 300, occupies a good\nhundred pages. It is a very detailed and demanding set\nof requirements. So there is a strong incentive, I\nstill believe, for parties to settle because in such a\ncase they do not have to establish that there is\nconsistency with the national contingency plan.\nThey also obtain immunity from suits,\nassuming it's in the matters addressed. Now a party\nthat voluntarily remediates a site has to worry about\nboth of these elements. It can be sued. It has no\nimmunity. It is certainly subject to being sued by\nanother PRP, by a State, an Indian tribe, or the\nGovernment, regardless of how much or how well it's done\nin remediating a site, whereas a settlement gives that\nprotection to a PRP.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you say there are two\nfactors which still exert pressure to settle. One is\nthat you don't have to bear the burden of showing that\nyou conform with the national contingency plan, and\nsecond, that --\nMR. ARMSTRONG: The second factor is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you insulate yourself\nfrom contribution suits by other people.\nMR. ARMSTRONG: That is correct, Your Honor.\nThat is absolutely correct. Because in cleaning up a\nsite, you can clean up all or part of a site. That's\nwhat 113(f)(3)(b) states.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you rely at all on -- in\n9607(a)(b)? It says any other necessary costs of\nresponse incurred by any other person. Does the word\n\"any\" add anything to your case? Do you think it urges\nus to give the broadest possible interpretation to other\nperson?\nMR. ARMSTRONG: I believe it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Other necessary costs?\nMR. ARMSTRONG: I believe it does, Your\nHonor. I mean, I can't imagine language more broad than\nthat. I do believe the first use of the word other that\nopposing counsel referred to is to make it quite clear\nthat there can't be a duplication of liability.\nObviously a PRP that is exposed to liability in a case\ncannot be required to pay both the Government and the\nother party who is cleaning up the site.\nAnd I would say that the second use of the\nword other, which has become quite critical in the\nGovernment's argument, the Government I think concedes\nthat the way the statute initially read in the first\ndraft omitted the term other and simply read any person.\nAnd the Government says well, the insertion of the word\nother prior to the enactment of CERCLA indicates that\nwhat Congress intended was to withdraw from that huge\nbasket, if you will, all PRPs. Well, that is not the\ncase at all, because initially the definition section of\nperson that was contained in the initial draft of CERCLA\ndid not include the United States. It cross-referenced\nthe Clean Water Act. So the United States was not a\nperson within the initial draft.\nAnd the addition of the word other, the\nsecond other in 107(a)(4)(b) was to make it clear.\nOtherwise, you're going to have a statute that says the\ngovernment can recover under (a)(4)(a) and (a)(4)(b).\nSo I do believe that the addition of the second word\nother simply explained and clarified that the Government\nwas to bring its action under 107(a)(4)(a), not under\n107(a)(4)(b).\nAnd I think as Justice Scalia has mentioned\nbefore, it would be very odd for Congress to have so\ndrastically changed CERCLA by inserting the word other\nwithout any commentary whatsoever. There was a good\ndeal of debate about the exclusion of joint and several\nliability under CERCLA, about the exclusion of\ncontribution, and other matters. There was not a\nmention made of the addition of the word other preceding\nperson in 107(a)(4)(b).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now you say this very\nlanguage that's in 107 now had been interpreted\nunanimously by the courts?\nMR. ARMSTRONG: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So that part of your case\nis that, is to say that it's limited by 113 is to say\nthat there's been an implied repeal.\nMR. ARMSTRONG: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unless all those cases were\nwrong.\nMR. ARMSTRONG: That is absolutely correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it's not just a\nlegislative history point you're making, it's not just a\npoint as to what Congress's expectations were. It's\nalso -- it's also a point that relates to implicit\nrepeal.\nMR. ARMSTRONG: It would be tantamount to a\nrepeal.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if the Government's\nonly strong point is that 113 is meant to coerce\nsettlement, and 113 didn't exist before, then it must be\nvery clear that previously 107 did give them a cause of\naction.\nMR. ARMSTRONG: That is absolutely correct.\nThat logic is impeccable, Your Honor, I believe so.\nBecause that -- that law was well established and there\nwas no -- there was no such thing as contribution.\nThere was no protection prior to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No acorns on the other\nside.\nMR. ARMSTRONG: No acorns.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask just one\nquestion about your position on the remedial settlement\nprovision in 113(f)(2)? Do you read it to provide not\nonly immunity from contribution suits but from any other\nlitigation whatsoever?\nMR. ARMSTRONG: No, Your Honor, it's not any\nother litigation whatsoever. I think that it is quite\nclear that what (f)(2) does provide is in a settlement,\nif a party is seeking under CERCLA -- now when you say\nother litigation, I assume you perhaps mean State law,\netcetera. If it's a State law contribution claim, I\nbelieve that provision would afford immunity from a\nState law contribution claim, assuming it could be\nasserted. Now of course it could not be asserted\nagainst the United States. But I do believe that that\nlanguage --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If there were a claim that\ndidn't really technically qualify as contribution, it\nwould not, it would not provide a bar.\nMR. ARMSTRONG: If it were a CERCLA claim,\nYour Honor, under 107(a)(4)(b), it would. However, if\nit is not a claim based upon CERCLA, and there are\ncertainly a myriad of claims that can be brought --\nremember, CERCLA is a strict liability provision -- I\ndon't believe that would bar all lawsuits entirely.\nThat's correct, Your Honor. If there's nothing further\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thanks,\nMr. Armstrong.\nMr. Geck.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY D. GECK\nON BEHALF OF WASHINGTON, ET AL., AS AMICI CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GECK: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nMay it please the Court:\nThere are more than 400,000 sites across the\ncountry that are contaminated by hazardous wastes. The\namici States recognize that if these sites are to be\ncleaned up, it's going to take the work of private\nparties. In turn, we recognize that private parties\nrely upon cost recovery to obtain their costs and\nfinancial incentives to do the site cleanup. The United\nStates argument ignores this vast majority of sites that\ndo not have the opportunity of litigation and do not\nhave the opportunity of settlement.\nI'll turn first to the words \"any other\nperson\" where the United States argues that it means\ninnocent person. The words \"innocent person\" are found\nnowhere in Section 107 of CERCLA. To get there, the\nUnited States borrows from other sections of CERCLA. If\nthe word other were superfluous -- and we do not think\nit is, we do not think that's the right reading -- the\nbetter textual reading here is the natural reading of\nSection 107. These are two sections that are\npractically twins and if words are known by the company\nthey keep, you have three parallel structures in each of\nthese cost recovery sections.\nAnd further, we point out that the\nGovernment's argument leads to an implausible result.\nIf people have to prove their innocence in order to\nqualify for a cost recovery claim, then there would be,\nindeed, a possible multiyear trial just in order to\ndecide whether they had a right to cost recovery. A far\nbetter approach would be not to destroy a cost recovery\nclaim after that work but to allow those issues, that is\na plaintiff's potential liability under 107, to be\nraised as a contribution counterclaim. And that way you\nhave an incentive for settlement between that private\nplaintiff and the defendants, and that way you have\nequity being done.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't the States\nprefer to proceed, to force people to proceed under 113,\nso that the States would have, you know, a hand in\ndeciding how the cleanup should go? I don't -- I don't\nquite understand why you're here. I would have thought\nthat the States' interest would be similar to the\nGovernment's.\nMR. GECK: The States recognize that to\nproceed under settlement puts a near impossible task.\nEPA, of course, can settle very few sites, they have\nlimited resources, and that's one of the reasons why we\ndon't have settlements in many cases. And apparently\nthey sometimes have disincentives for proceeding with a\nsettlement because it would open the Government to a\ncontribution claim. The States also have some other\nresource limits.\nThe States in order to go into a settlement,\nand this is an important point, the Government is\nblurring the State settlement right here. It's\nreferring to a cost recovery right which the States\ncould seek under Section 107 of CERCLA, but there's a\ngreat deal of uncertainty as to whether a State\nsettlement that orders a cleanup would be a resolution\nof CERCLA liability, and a Second Circuit case from Con\nEdison that's pending before this Court discusses that\nat length. Uncertainty does not drive settlement.\nYou asked a question, Justice Scalia, about\nother reasons why there are incentives for settlement,\nand I'd point out a third, fourth and fifth one. One,\nyou do get to settle your claims that the Government is\nbringing against you, which is a powerful incentive to\nsettle, to have peace with the Government in certainty.\nAnd then a further point is that you get no better\nremedy necessarily. There is no reason to walk away\nfrom the settlement with the Government, and I don't\nbelieve the Government can point to any examples where\npeople have walked away from settlements in order to\npursue 107 claims, because 107 doesn't necessarily lead\nto a windfall. If you're a liable person or potentially\nliable person, you're going to see your defendants raise\nyour liability and they are going to interpose a\ncross-claim under Section 113.\nAnd finally --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that how it\nworks? They would have to, if you bring a 107 action,\nthe defendant has to bring his responsive action under\n113? Or is it as, I guess your friend had stated\nearlier, equitable principles are going to lead to an\nallocation of responsibility under 107?\nMR. GECK: I would rely first on the textual\nbasis, that any person can bring a cost recovery claim.\nAnd then the text in Section 113(f)(1) says that any\nperson sued under Section 107 may bring their\ncontribution claim against any other person. That would\nnaturally include even the plaintiff in that claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The last sentence of\n(f)(1), right?\nMR. GECK: The fifth sentence of (f)(1) is\nwhat I was referring to. Any person may seek\ncontribution from -- and this is at 67a of the petition,\nand I believe it's 9a or 11a of the U.S. brief -- any\nperson may seek contribution from any other person who\nis liable or potentially liable under Section 107 during\nor following the 107 action. A 113 action supplements\nthe 107 action that the government is so concerned\nabout.\nTurning then to the question that this would\nbypass contribution protection: As a threshold matter,\nthat is an issue that is rooted in the language of\nSection 113(f)(2). It is not a signal as to how to\ninterpret Section 107 itself, because there are a host\nof potential 107 actions that might come to bear that\nthe United States admits to and those actions could\nequally be posed. But more importantly perhaps is that\nbecause any person who does a settlement with the\nGovernment would raise their settlement either as a\ndefense or as a counterclaim, as my colleague said, the\ncourt would have the authority under 113(f)(1), the\nthird sentence, there to allocate and apportion\nresponsibility among all liable persons. And at that\npoint, if it had been a judicial settlement that would\nbe very strong evidence that you had paid your\nproportionate share to the site.\nFurthermore, what the Government is\noverlooking is the settlements, there are a number of\nchecks and balances on settlements. This is not a real\nworld problem that the Government describing. The\nmatters addressed, provision of the settlement that the\nEPA very carefully crafts, doesn't overreach.\nOccasionally it will, but when it does address an entire\ncleanup at a site that signals that the EPA is going to\nbe in control of the cleanup for the remainder of the\nsite and you're not going to have unknown parties coming\nin and entering a site.\nTo do so would be in fact inconsistent\nwith the national contingency plan and you would never\nmake the elements of proving consistency with the\nnational consistency plan in triggering a 107 right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's the meaning of that\nlast sentence in (f)(1), \"Nothing in this subsection\nshall diminish the right of any person to bring an\naction of contribution in the absence of a civil\naction,\" of a civil action under 9606 or 9607? What are\nthey referring to.\nMR. GECK: Well, it clearly indicates that\nthere is a savings for other contribution rights that\nmay exist under other areas of law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: State law?\nMR. GECK: State law is certainly a\npossibility there and that would of course be a stronger\nindicator that you could give a broader reading to\ncontribution protection under (f)(2) and that's what\nseveral courts have done. But the scope of whether a\nState law meets contribution protection has been debated\nin the courts and it's of course not before us today.\nIn the end, the last and most important\npoint is that the Government's construction not only\nbars cost recovery from potentially liable persons even\nan innocent person who reads Section 107 would not step\nforward. If you touch a site and you begin operating\nand moving waste -- and Mr. Chief Justice, your\nhypothetical about a do-gooder organization that might\ncome in and do cleanups. There is a good likelihood\nthat they would be receiving a counterclaim that would\nsay that they had operated the site and become a liable\nparty. And that could litigate for years.\nSo in the end, in the end of the case, the\nUnited States leaves no incentive for private cost\nrecovery and there are 400,000 sites that do need\ncleanup, and Congress did contemplate there would be two\ncause of actions, one under 107 for cost recovery when\npeople had incurred costs, and the other one would be\nfor contribution when people had been sued or had\nsettled their civil suit liability.\nIf there is no further questions, thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Geck.\n(Whereupon, at 10:57 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\nMr. Hungar, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HUNGAR: Mr. Chief Justice:\nJustice Souter, in further answer to your\nquestion, EPA can and does send PRP letters to Federal\nPRPs without approval from the Justice Department. The\napproval is only for a unilateral administrative order\nunder Section 106.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So the only thing they\nwould need the Attorney General's approval for would be\ninstitution of suit?\nMR. HUNGAR: Or a unilateral administrative\norder.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Could they institute suit?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, in our view the EPA can't\nsue the Department of Defense because there would be no\njusticiable controversy.\nWith respect to the implied repeal issue\nthat was discussed, we disagree strongly with the\nassertion that there was this unanimous group of ten or\nsome cases prior to 1986. In fact the cases were\ndivided, as we explain in our reply brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But even if there wasn't,\nyou wouldn't have your principal argument, which is, you\nknow, which is that the reason not to interpret 107 the\nway your friends on the other side want is that you're\ngoing to destroy the settlement provision of 113, which\ndidn't use to exist. What argument would you make for\nhaving us read the word \"other\" in the what seems to me\nstrange way you want?\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, the point is that\nthe settlement bar under their interpretation is either\neviscerated, as Respondents amici argue, or that's the\nposition that they take, that they want to be able to\nsue for cost recovery and evade the settlement bar.\nRespondent of course doesn't make that argument because\nthey don't have to in this case. But unless the Court\nimports the settlement bar into cost recovery actions,\nthere's going to be this huge problem. And if the Court\ndoes import --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're missing my point.\nMy point is the settlement bar didn't used to exist. So\npreviously, whether the cases were split or not, there\nwas -- your best argument for the proposition that\n107(a) does not permit suit did not exist.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, as I understand the\nargument it's that there was this unanimous pre-1986\nbody of law and it was completely clear and perfectly\nunderstood that there was this cause of action.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Assume it didn't exist.\nAssume that body of law didn't exist. But what would\nyou have argued when somebody came in and said 107, this\nprovision, includes PRPs? You may have argued -- your\nbest argument would not have been available.\nMR. HUNGAR: But, Your Honor, the point is\nit was not clear in 1986 what this language meant and\nwhat the extent of the PRP rights were. Congress\naddressed that question. There is not a hint of a\nsuggestion in the legislative history that Congress was\nrecognizing a PRP action under 107 independent of\nSection 113. Congress spoke to the question of PRPs\nsuing and the only way it spoke to it explicitly was in\nSection 113. When Congress says that, this Court has\nsaid over and over again that when Congress speaks in an\narea of uncertainty, as in Fausto, as in Brock against\nNorth Dakota, as in the State of Vermont, is where the\nprior asserted right was not clearly established, was\nnot authoritatively recognized, it's not an implied\nrepeal question. It's a question of reconciling the\nstatutes in a way that gives effect to the later\nstatutes, a more specific statute.\nWhich as here, Section 113, their\ninterpretation gives effect to part of it because they\nsay oh well, let's borrow a settlement bar to make it\nall work, but you can't do -- you can't do it that way.\nThe Court rejected that very same approach in the Rancho\nPalos Verdes case from a couple of terms ago.\nWe agree that you need to borrow the\nlimitations of Section 113(f). You just need to borrow\nall of them, including the one that they can't satisfy,\nwhich is that Congress said for suits by PRPs against\nPRPs, just like is normally the case among joint tort\nfeasors, it's a contribution suit and they have to wait\nfor a law suit or for a settlement, or some discharge of\nthe liability. And that also avoids burdening the\ncourts with the extremely time-consuming and costly and\ndifficult question of assessing whether the NCP has been\ncomplied with, whether the costs comply with the\nnational contingency plan. Because if they settled,\nthen the expert agency has already had a chance to\naddress that and the court doesn't need to get into it\nin anywhere near the same detail. Their approach is a\nrecipe for burdening the Federal courts with claims that\nCongress did not clearly indicate should be there.\nIf States want to provide contribution\nactions that allow these sorts of claims they can, and\nmany States have done so, including Washington State,\nwhich is here. So parties can bring these claims in\nState court if they want to. They can get settlements\nfrom the States if they want to and are willing to pay\nthe costs. So the burdens that they identify are not\nthere. Implied repeal does not apply here and because\nof the uncertainty, as we indicated at pages 9 through\n10 of our reply brief and footnote 5, there was no\nunanimous widespread consensus among the Federal courts.\nThis just hasn't come up very much, and the courts were\ndivided. I'd also like to address -- thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
