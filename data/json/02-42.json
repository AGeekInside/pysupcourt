        "content": "[11:02 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in number 02-42, Franchise Tax Board of California\nversus Gilbert Hyatt.\nMr. Leatherwood.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF FELIX LEATHERWOOD\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\nplease the Court:\nRespondent has prompted the Nevada courts to\nextend their authority over California's tax process. The\nNevada court has said at Joint Appendix 138, the entire\nprocess, of FTB audits of Hyatt, including the FTB's\nassessment of taxes and the protests, is at issue in this\ncase, end quote. This has been said to mean, at Joint\nAppendix 138, that the tax process is under attack.\nThis lawsuit interferes with California's\ncapacity to administer these taxes. The administration of\ntaxes is a core, sovereign responsibility from which all\nfunctions of State Government depend on. It is protected\nby immunity laws of common-law tort lawsuits, like the\nkind presented by Respondent.\nCalifornia has invoked the protection of its\nimmunity laws, but the Nevada courts have allowed\nrespondents laws to proceed, not by extending full faith\nand credit. And this refusal threatens our constitutional\nsystem for cooperative federalism in violation of Article\nIV, Section 1 of the United States Code.\nQUESTION: Mr. Leatherwood, may I ask you a\nthreshold question? Some of your friends in this case\nhave invited an overruling of Nevada against Hall. Of\ncourse, California was favored by that decision. Do you\njoin in the plea to overrule Nevada v. Hall, or do you say\nthis case is different because it involves core sovereign\nfunctions?\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Justice Ginsberg, we do not\njoin in the chorus to overrule Nevada v. Hall. This case\nis different. This case goes to footnote 24 of Nevada v.\nHall.\nthe sense that it does -- it does not implicate another\nstate managing another state's core sovereign function.\nIt's -- Nevada v. Hall was strictly an automobile\naccident.\nQUESTION: But the comparison would be between\nthe university, education, which was the -- which was the\ndefendant, and the tax authorities. Both of those,\neducation and tax, seem core. Or if you're going to\ncompare the tort itself, it would be a comparison between\nnegligent driving, on the one hand, and going into another\nstate and committing -- you know, peering through windows,\ngoing through garbage, totally wrongly getting all the\nneighbors to reveal private information, et cetera. So\ncomparing the particular acts, what's the difference, or\ncomparing sovereign functions, what's the difference?\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: I mean, compared -- I thank\nyou, Your Honor -- in comparing the sovereign functions --\nQUESTION: Education versus tax.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Yeah, and driving an\nautomobile in another state's -- on another state's\nhighway --\nQUESTION: That's not the sovereign function.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: That's not --\nQUESTION: I'm saying that --\nMR. LEATHERWOOD:\nQUESTION: -- it seems like that's apples and\noranges to me. That is, in the one case, we're looking at\nthe acts they're complaining of, and here the plaintiff is\ncomplaining of acts that took place in Nevada that were\nmiles outside what would be reasonable. I'm not saying\nhe's right, but that's his complaint. In Nevada v. Hall,\nthey were complaining about negligent driving. So what's\nthe difference there?\nOr, alternatively, in Nevada v. Hall, it was a\ndriver who worked for a university, and here it is an\ninvestigator who works for the tax board. So what's the\ndifference there?\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Well, to answer the Court's\nquestion directly, the most significant difference is that\nthe tax function is -- is much more significant than the\neducation function.\nQUESTION: Well, that's -- that -- that --that\nwould be a very difficult premise for us to say, that\neducation is somehow secondary.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Well --\nQUESTION: You're -- you're saying Nevada can't\nhave a great university -- can have a great university by\nkeeping its people within its own borders. They can't go\nto California to get information to solicit, to recruit\nstudents?\nfor us to write on that premise.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: No, Your Honor, I would agree\nwith you that that would be a difficult --\nQUESTION: For the State of California to argue\nthat education is not a core state function is, to me,\nrather astounding.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: No, Your Honor, I'm not\narguing that education is not a core sovereign function.\nWhat I'm arguing is that taxation is an essential core\nsovereign function since that education cannot move\nforward --\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. --\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: -- to provide taxation.\nQUESTION: -- Leatherwood, we -- this Court\ntried to follow a core state function test under the Tenth\nAmendment. And in Garcia, kind of gave it up, didn't it,\nas being an unworkable thing. Now, why would we want to\nresurrect that here? And why is it that you don't say,\nwell, if the Court wants to overrule Nevada v. Hall,\nthat's fine; I'll win. I mean, I don't understand your\nposition. You're asking us to go back to a test that we\nrejected under the Tenth Amendment in Garcia, but you\ndon't want to say, sure, if you want to overrule Nevada v.\nHall, be my guest.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Yes, Your Honor. Justice\nO'Connor, what we are attempting to say here is that this\ncase is more analogous to this Court's jurisprudence in\nthe area of the Federal Tax Injunction Act along the line\nof fair assessment -- the fair assessment cases, where the\nCourt has directed that the Federal Government will back\noff on trying to manage state taxes.\nQUESTION: There you have a specific act of\nCongress that tells the Federal Government to back off.\nAnd I don't believe you have any such thing here.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: But we do have the Full Faith\nand Credit Clause, which directs that a state is to\nrecognize the public acts of another state. And we do\nhave an immunity law applicable here, and this directs\nthat Nevada should respect the immunity laws of the State\nof California. And the immunity law, in this particular\ninstance, provide absolute immunity for conduct as\nundertaken in a -- in a tax audit. Anything that's\nassociated with tax audit, is protected.\nQUESTION: But Nevada did recognize California\nlaw to the extent it was similar to Nevada's -- that is,\nsaying you had immunity from the negligent acts. And then\nit went on to say, no, you don't have immunity from\nintentional acts, even though California law does give\nimmunity from intentional acts. But surely you wouldn't\ngo to the extreme that you would say someone could come\nover to Las Vegas from California and just beat up\nsomebody because they haven't paid their taxes, would\nthey?\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Absolutely, I agree with the\nCourt on that point. The --\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: -- the extension of that --\nQUESTION: Why do you agree on that point? I\ndon't understand that?\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Because the extension of our\nimmunity law does not cover physical torts or torts --\nQUESTION: Oh.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: -- outside the scope --\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: -- of course, the scope of --\nof the -- the acts that are incidental to --\nQUESTION: I see. So under California law,\nthere would be -- that would be actionable; whereas, under\nNevada law, here, what they're doing is actionable. You\njust want to use the California standard rather -- rather\nthan the Nevada standard.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Well, in fact, Your Honor, if\nthey would use the Nevada standard, use the same standard\nthat Nevada applies to its own taxing agencies, then this\ncase would be on a hold.\nparticular case is that it has gone outside its own\nprecedent and applied a different standard to California\ntaxing agencies, and it's not --\nQUESTION: But that's not what they're -- the\nNevada court said, we're going to treat the tax collectors\nfrom anywhere who come in to our state and act here, and\nwe're going to -- the Nevada Supreme Court said, we're\ngoing to apply our rule, and our rule is negligence,\nthere's immunity; intentional, there isn't. So you're\nasking us to discredit or disbelieve the Nevada Supreme\nCourt when it said, the law we apply to tax collectors who\nact in this state is the same as we apply to Nevada tax\ncollectors.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Your Honor, I am not asking\nthis Court to not believe the Nevada Supreme Court. But\nwhat I'm saying is that Nevada has published precedent, as\nrecent as 1989, where it requires that a taxpayer forego\nbringing a lawsuit until they -- until there has been --\nuntil there's a resolution of all statutory procedures.\nQUESTION: Oh, but this -- but Nevada Supreme\nCourt, I thought, made very clear that what they were\ndealing with is tortious conduct, harassing conduct.\nThey, in fact, refused -- Nevada Supreme Court refused to\ndecide where this man was domiciled, because that would\ninterfere with the ongoing procedure in California on the\ntax liability. I thought that the Nevada Supreme Court\nhad made it clear that they were dealing with the way\ntheir resident is being harassed and not with where he was\ndomiciled on a magic date.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Your Honor, what has happened\nin this particular case, 97 percent of the conduct that\noccurred during the course of this audit occurred in\nCalifornia. And, quite naturally, what Nevada is -- what\nNevada is doing is permitting Mr. Hyatt to go behind the\nactual tort and make a collateral attack on the tax\nitself.\nQUESTION: Well, that may be, but the that isn't\nthe issue that we've got in front of us here. I mean, the\nquestion in front of us is not how far can the Nevada\ncourts go in reviewing California's tax practice. The\nissue before us is, among others, in a claim of tort\nagainst your -- your operative in Nevada, for the manner\nin which the tax is collected is their absolute immunity.\nAnd, you know, maybe the Nevada courts are going too far\nin discovery, but that's not the issue in front of us.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: I would absolutely agree with\nthe Court that the issue is whether or not Nevada was\nobligated to apply our immunity laws with respect --\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD:\nundertaken incidental to this audit.\nQUESTION: May I go back to Justice Stevens'\nquestion, because I'm not sure of your answer to it. What\nif the State of California passed a statute tomorrow\nmorning saying the use of thumbscrews in tax collection is\nauthorized? Is -- would your answer to Justice Stevens'\nquestion be that -- or wouldn't your answer to Justice\nStevens' question be that if you went into Nevada and you\nused thumbscrews, you would be entitled, on your theory,\nto absolute immunity? Isn't that correct?\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Your Honor, no. What I'm\nsaying is that, under that particular theory, I do not\nthink that you could pass law in the State of California\nthat will essentially sanction a crime, and there was no\ncrimes committed within the course of this audit.\nIf the -- if an auditor commits an intentional\ntort, such as a burglary or a trespass in Nevada or in\nCalifornia, it's -- it's our position that that particular\nconduct is not incidental to --\nQUESTION: It doesn't matter. I mean, we're\ntrying to get the -- we're trying to get the analysis of\nit, and I'm having exactly the same problem. Imagine that\nthere, California did say there is absolute immunity, even\nif you beat somebody up, absolute tort immunity. Okay?\nEven for beating people up.\nthat; you could prosecute it as a crime. Now you're in\nNevada, and they say, the plaintiff, he beat me up, he\ncame across the state line, down from Lake Tahoe. He was\nin a bad mood, lost too much money at the casino, and he\nbeat me up. All right? Now, can Nevada bring that\nlawsuit or not? That's, I think, what Justice Stevens'\nquestion was.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Well -- well, I understand\nthat, Your Honor. My position is that even though that\nlaw does not exist in California --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: -- but applying --\nQUESTION: If it did.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: -- applying it -- my -- our\nparticular theory --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: -- that, yes, we -- then\nNevada would be obligated under the Full Faith and Credit\nClause to apply that particular law. But --\nQUESTION: And, therefore, you could not bring\nthe lawsuit in Nevada about somebody beating somebody up.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: If --\nQUESTION: If that were the law in California.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: -- if that were -- if that was\nthe case. But --\nQUESTION: Yeah, okay.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: -- in this particular case,\nthat's illegal in California and that's illegal in Nevada.\nQUESTION: So how, then, do we reconcile that\nposition, where we're back to our starting place, with the\nfact that he could bring an action if on his way down from\nLake Tahoe in the state car, he happened to drive a little\nnegligently and ran somebody over? I mean, that's Nevada\nv. Hall, just reverse the states.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: No, and we're agreeing with\nNevada v. Hall.\nQUESTION: I know. So this is why we're having\na problem. It's clear that if our tax collector, on his\nway down from Lake Tahoe, runs over a Nevada resident, the\nNevada resident can sue and apply Nevada law.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Yes, I --\nQUESTION: You say, if, in fact, that same tax\ncollector beats up somebody, and the California law is\nthat you cannot sue, Nevada cannot apply its own law.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: That's not what I'm saying,\nYour Honor. I'm saying if that conduct -- if that conduct\nis connected to the actual audit itself, then it's\nprotected. But what I'm saying, I cannot possibly see,\nunder any possible theory, that a beating, that it -- that\nbreaking into someone's house could actually be part of\nthe assessment -- tax assessment process. If an auditor\nengages in that kind of behavior, the auditor is not\ncovered under the absolute immunity. That is outside the\nscope of that --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: -- of that statute.\nQUESTION: And is the reason that the answer is\ndifferent in the two cases, the reason that there is\nsomething special about tax collection or is the reason\nthat there is a closer connection in the hypo of the\nbeating up for tax collection than the driving the\nautomobile for tax collection?\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Well --\nQUESTION: Which is it? Is it the nature of the\ntax collection or the nature of the activity which leads\nto the tort liability?\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Well, I think it's both, Your\nHonor. Well, first of all, tax -- tax collection, by\ndefinition, is an intrusion of someone's life. The\nallegations alleged here are principally invasion of\nprivacy, disclosure of information, that sort of thing.\nNinety-seven percent of that conduct occurred in\nCalifornia. You cannot possibly investigate or prosecute\nMr. Hyatt's case without intruding into that tax --\nQUESTION:\nposition, it would be exactly the same if a hundred\npercent of the conduct had occurred in Nevada.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Absolutely, Your Honor. That\n-- but -- but --\nQUESTION: But the problem I have -- may I just\nask this question. Assume there is a -- there's a\ndifference between Nevada law and California law, as I\nunderstand it. Some things are actionable against a tax\npeople in one state and not the other. Why is it, in your\nview, that if the same conduct had occurred six months\nlater, but by Nevada tax collectors instead of by\nCalifornia tax collectors, because he's been in both\nstates and probably is subject to tax in both, Nevada\nwould allow the suit against its own tax people but not\nallow it against the California tax people? Why does that\nmake sense?\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Well, Your Honor, in this\nparticular case, as I've indicated, according to our\nreading of Nevada precedent, published precedent, that\nthey would not permit this lawsuit to proceed until the\ntax process has been concluded. With respect to -- to\ndirectly answer your question, it does not appear that\nNevada would prosecute its own -- would permit a\nprosecution of its own agents in the case where the\nallegations are principally that there is an intrusion\ninto Mr. Hyatt's life or that there --\nQUESTION: Well, we understood the reasoning of\nthe Nevada Supreme Court to say they would. I think -- I\nmust have misread the opinion. Is that --\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: No, absolutely not, Your\nHonor. I don't think you misread the opinion. What I\nthink the Nevada Supreme Court said is that they will\npermit intentional tort prosecution of government\nemployees. This case does not involve a government\nemployee. This case involves a government agency itself,\na tax agency. And under Nevada law, you cannot proceed\nagainst the Nevada tax agency without first exhausting\nyour administrative and statutory remedies to contest the\nunderlying tax itself.\nQUESTION: But certainly this sort of thing\nisn't the kind of thing you could have exhausted your\nremedies on, is it?\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Absolutely, Your Honor. In\nour -- in our -- it is our position that this entire --\nthe entire lawsuit is linked up to our tax process,\nbecause the conduct that the Respondent is complaining\nabout here is that the tax itself is -- the tax itself and\nthe tax process is engaged in bad faith. And I would --\nQUESTION: Now, what is -- was your answer to\nthe question?\ndriving negligently in Nevada --\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Part --\nQUESTION: Suppose the tax collector were\ndriving negligently in Las Vegas. It's very important for\nthe tax collector to go examine the record, and he's\ndriving negligently. What --\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: I think, under Nevada v. Hall,\nhe would be -- he would be subject to negligent liability.\nIt's not connected to a core silent function because the\nfunction here is -- the function here is a tax\ninvestigation, whereas, driving is something that you can\ninvestigate independent of the tax process itself.\nQUESTION: So suppose that we -- we conclude\nthat footnote 24 does not provide sufficient guidance for\nus to have a stable jurisprudence and that you will lose\nunless Nevada versus Hall is overruled. Would you then\nask us to overrule Nevada versus Hall?\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: I know you don't want to entertain\nthat possibility, but suppose that's what we conclude.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Well, we -- we've thought\nabout this, Your Honor, of course, and we would accept a\nwin, if that's the Court's direction, through overruling\nNevada v. Hall, but it's our contention that the Court\ndoesn't have to go that far to get -- to get to this\npoint. The Court can literally analogize to the special\nprotections that are provided to state tax systems within\nthe federal system itself.\nQUESTION: But then that, as I suggested\nearlier, is a difficult thing to do, because there are\ncongressional statutes that mandate that here. And all we\nhave is the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Now, perhaps\nyou say that's sufficient, but isn't it possible that\nthere might be other emanations of the Full Faith and\nCredit Clause, other than just footnote 24, or whatever it\nis, in Nevada against Hall. I'm not talking about\noverruling it, but developing it, perhaps.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Yes, Your Honor. I would\nagree with that. Of course, we think that Nevada's\nfailure to recognize or give dignity to California's\nimmunity statute is not only a violation of the Full Faith\nand Credit Clause, but is a hostile act, and this kind of\nhostility is contrary to our whole concept of --\nQUESTION: What -- what about a congressional\nstatute? That is, suppose the opinion read -- what would\nyour objection -- I know you'll object to this possible\nopinion, and I want to hear what your objection is -- the\nopinion says they're complaining here, as far as we're\nconcerned, with a serious tort, invasion of privacy, you\nknow, a whole lot of really bad behavior, et cetera --\nthey're complaining about that taking place by a\nCalifornia official in Nevada, and we can't really\ndistinguish that from the automobile accident taking place\nin Nevada. They're both torts. They're both very bad --\nyou know, this is worse conduct. Now, it's true that our\ninvestigation of this may interfere with California's tax\nauthority's ability to sort of run investigations in\ngeneral. But if that turns out to be a problem, a big\nproblem, Congress can legislate.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Well, that still creates --\nthat still creates the situation where Nevada is\nsupervising and managing California's tax practices.\nQUESTION: Back to activities happening in\nNevada.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Yeah. In this lawsuit -- this\nlawsuit is -- is being prosecuted -- is being investigated\nalmost exclusively in California. The -- the intrusion\nhere, the interference here, is that Nevada has permitted\nMr. Hyatt to use this lawsuit both as a -- as a wall and a\nbattering ram. It has almost suppressed the entire\nCalifornia tax investigation. It's creating an entire\nclass of possible plaintiffs that can sue California just\nfor literally going across the state line and making an\ninquiry as to whether or not a former California resident,\na former California taxpayer, actually owes any taxes.\nQUESTION: Well, they would have to show its an\nintentional -- whatever that means under Nevada law -- not\njust negligent wouldn't they --\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Well, the intentional act here\nis that California created a tax system in bad faith to --\nbad faith to extort an exit -- an exit tax from -- from a\ntaxpayer.\nQUESTION: I thought that, again, the Nevada\nSupreme Court said, we are not going to touch the question\nof where this man was domiciled. That's for California to\ndecide. What we are dealing with is this new thing. One\nallegation was trespass and going through the man's trash,\nand another was calling -- maybe the calls emanated in\nCalifornia -- calling people in Nevada insinuating bad\nthings about this person. And that has nothing to do with\nwhere the man is domiciled. It's a question that\nCalifornia is deciding and Nevada says it won't touch.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Yeah, and I would -- I would\ndirect the Court to Joint Appendix 133, where -- where the\nCourt would -- the Nevada courts have indicated that\nalmost all the action in this -- in this lawsuit occurred\nin California. And --\nQUESTION: Well, you -- you recognized that\nthere were two trips into California.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD:\nQUESTION: I mean, to Nevada.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Actually, Your Honor, I\nbelieve there were three trips, and they were short trips\n-- they were trips of extremely short duration.\nQUESTION: And what was there about -- on one of\nthose trips, there was a trespass on his property and\nrummaging through his trash.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Well, that's not part of --\nthat's not part of the allegations of the -- of the\ncomplaint itself. The complaint is saying that --\nQUESTION: It was a more -- a more general\ninterference with his privacy, but those were examples\nthat were alleged, if not in the complaint, somewhere.\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: No, there has been deposition\ntestimony that there -- on one of the trips, that the\ninvestigator looked at the timing of Mr. -- of\nRespondent's trash delivery and also looked at --\ndetermined whether or not Respondent was receiving any\nmail at that particular location. That does not justify\nthe pervasive nature and the extent in which this lawsuit\nhas reached into California and literally attacked the tax\nprocess.\nAnd, once again, I will refer the Court to the\nJoint Appendix at page 60, where it is alleged that the\nCalifornia tax system itself is a -- is a fraud -- that\nis, put together in bad faith for the specific purpose of\nextorting an exit tax from former residents who -- as they\nleave California.\nWell, if the Court has no more questions in this\nregard, I would like --\nQUESTION: Do you want to reserve your time, Mr.\nLeatherwood?\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: -- reserve the balance of my\ntime, thank you.\nQUESTION: Very well.\nMr. Farr, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. FARR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nIn our federal system, it's recognized that the\nstates will sometimes have overlapping jurisdiction. When\nthat happens, the Constitution allows each state to apply\nits own laws against the background principle of comity\nwhere they believe it would be appropriate to defer to the\nlaws of another state. And I submit that the Nevada\ncourts here have applied these principles very carefully.\nNevada, of course, correctly held that they were\nnot required to apply California's legislative-created law\nof immunity.\nprinciples of comity to strike out the declaratory\njudgment count that would have gone to the very issue that\nis being contested in the Florida -- excuse me -- in the\nCalifornia tax proceeding, which is the date that\nMr. Hyatt moved to Nevada. And they have also given\nCalifornia complete immunity for any negligence that it\nhas committed.\nSo in this case, it seems to me, the system is\nworking --\nQUESTION: Mr. Farr, can I ask you, do you think\nthey were compelled by the Full Faith and Credit Clause to\ngrant immunity on the negligence claim?\nMR. FARR: That's an interesting question,\nJustice Stevens, because Nevada officials themselves have\nimmunity. There would be a question, I suppose, of\nwhether the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires that.\nMy general feeling is probably not, but that is really not\na question so much of whether -- a choice of law between\nCalifornia law and Nevada law, but simply a question of\nwhat Nevada law would apply. So I don't think that the\nFull Faith and Credit Clause itself speaks to that issue,\nbut I do think principles of comity will traditionally\nreach that result. And, in fact --\nQUESTION: Well, are principles of comity\ndictated by the Constitution? Suppose --\nMR. FARR: They are --\nQUESTION: -- suppose Nevada said they were not\ngoing to grant comity?\nMR. FARR: That's correct, yes. And I don't\nthink there is a federally enforceable law of state\ncomity, but I think that is the system that has existed\nessentially between sovereigns for much longer than the\nUnited States is --\nQUESTION: Well, is it your position then the\nprivate plaintiff can always bring suit against a state in\nthe courts of another state?\nMR. FARR: Well, the first question, of course,\nis whether the court has legislative -- the first Full\nFaith and Credit question is whether the court in which\nthe suit is brought has legislative jurisdiction. So\nthere is a requirement that that state have\nconstitutionally sufficient contacts with the law --\nQUESTION: Well, then under due process. Well,\nthat's easy to satisfy.\nMR. FARR: So assuming that they've satisfied\nthat, they are entitled to bring a suit. Then the\nquestion is whether the state -- and I -- and I believe at\nthat point the state is free to apply its own laws to\nprotect its own interests. I think that's what the Full\nFaith and Credit Clause allows.\ncomity that provides the acknowledgment of the state --\nthe other state's interests. And that's typically, in\nfact, what's happened since Nevada --\nQUESTION: It's very --\nMR. FARR: -- versus Hall --\nQUESTION: -- it's very odd to me that\nCalifornia can't be sued in its own courts and it can't be\nsued in a federal court, but it can be sued in a Nevada\ncourt, which, if we follow that declension really has the\n-- has the least interest in maintaining the dignity of\nthe State of California.\nMR. FARR: Well, there are two -- two factors\nhere, Justice Kennedy. First of all, there is the fact\nthat Nevada has some very real interests of its own, its\nown sovereign interests to protect here. I mean, there\nhave been torts which were both committed in Nevada and\ndirected at a Nevada resident. So, to begin with, before\none gets to the immunity question, Nevada, as a sovereign\nstate, has important interests in assuring compensation\nand also in deterring that kind of conduct. So the idea\nthat a legislatively created immunity by another state\nshould be able to prevent Nevada from protecting those\ninterests seems inconsistent with the federal system.\nNow, if one goes beyond that to the question of\ninherent immunity, the very idea that a state should have\nto be subject to sue in the courts of another state, I\nthink, first of all, as you know, we don't believe that\nissue is properly presented on the question presented in\nthis case. But if you would like me to address it just\nfor a moment, I think there -- there are differences if\none looks to the -- to the way that the -- essentially\nimmunity has been resolved in -- in the course of -- of\nthe United States.\nFirst of all, in its own courts, it has the\ncommon-law immunity based on the idea that it is both the\nking being sued in its own court, and also typically it is\nalso the progenitor of the law, so to speak, to Justice\nHolmes' point.\nIn the United States, there's -- the courts of\nthe United States, there's a very specific situation. At\nthe time of the convention, the states were, obviously,\nforming a new sovereign, and the question of whether that\nsovereign was going to grant them the immunity they had in\ntheir own courts or whether that sovereign would be in the\nsame position essentially as foreign sovereigns typically\nwere, which is that they did not have to provide\nsovereignty except as a matter of comity. That's The\nSchooner Exchange opinion.\nBut -- so the states, at that point, had a very\nreal interest in deciding that question, and they did, in\nfact, decide that question, as the court has recognized.\nThat is not true with respect to the immunity that they\nhave had in the courts of other states.\nQUESTION: Is -- how does Alden fit into this?\nIn Alden, I take it the court now -- we've held that a\ncitizen of Maine suing in the State of Maine's courts\nalleging that Maine had violated a federal law can't do\nit. Sovereign immunity. Right? That's Alden.\nAll right. Suppose the citizen of Maine walks\ninto a New Hampshire court and brings the same lawsuit\nagainst Maine, assuming New Hampshire has appropriate\njurisdiction under its own laws.\nMR. FARR: Uh-huh.\nQUESTION: Do we get a different result?\nMR. FARR: Okay, I think that is not a question\nthat is within the notion of the question in this case.\nQUESTION: No, no, well --\nMR. FARR: I'm sorry. I --\nQUESTION: -- you see, what I --\nMR. FARR: Excuse me.\nQUESTION: -- nonetheless, although --\nMR. FARR: No, I --\nQUESTION: -- what I'm trying to do is -- is\nsort out what, in my mind, are a set of impossible\nanomalies, and that's why I ask you that question.\nMR. FARR: I'm sorry. I started to answer in\nthe wrong way.\nQUESTION: Go ahead.\nMR. FARR: What I -- I reserve, of course, the\npoint, always, that I don't believe this is within the\nquestion presented.\nQUESTION: Yeah, yeah, of course.\nMR. FARR: But I actually was going -- what I\nmeant to say is that I don't think it's the same kind of\nquestion in the sense that I think still when you're\ntalking about enforcement of a federal cause of action in\nanother state, that is still really a federal-state\nquestion.\nQUESTION: See, but --\nMR. FARR: That's still --\nQUESTION: -- your answer, then --\nMR. FARR: -- an evolving question.\nQUESTION: -- your answer to my question is\nAlden cannot be avoided simply by the Maine citizen\nwalking into a New Hampshire court and bringing the same\ncase.\nMR. FARR: That's correct.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. FARR: I think that is --\nQUESTION:\nMR. FARR: -- still a federal-state --\nQUESTION: All right, assuming that's right --\nMR. FARR: -- I think that is still a federal-\nstate issue.\nQUESTION: -- assuming that's right, now, look\nat the tremendous anomaly, which you were just about to\naddress, and I want to be sure you do. Our citizen of\nMaine walks into the New Hampshire court and sues the\nState of Maine under federal law. And the answer is, he\ncan't do it because of sovereign immunity. Our citizen of\nMaine does the same thing, but this time his cause of\naction is state law. And now you say he can do it.\nMR. FARR: That's right. And --\nQUESTION: And the only difference between the\ntwo cases is that his cause of action is federal law in\nthe first case, and he can't sue the state; but state law\nin the second case, and he can, which, of course, means\nthat the law of New Hampshire binds Maine in a way that\nfederal law cannot. Now, that, to me, I just can't --\nthat, to me, seems so anomalous that -- that I'd like an\nexplanation --\nMR. FARR: Well --\nQUESTION: -- if you can give it. And you see\nhow I'm thinking of it as connected here, because the\nfacts here are just part of that general anomaly.\nMR. FARR: That's correct. Actually, Justice\nBreyer, I think that's something that the court, to some\nextent, addressed in Alden itself --\nQUESTION: Uh-huh.\nMR. FARR: -- in distinguishing the opinion in\nNevada versus Hall, when it noted that when you get into\nthe situation of a state being sued in the courts of\nanother state and, as in Nevada versus Hall, under a state\ncause of action, you have now implicated the sovereignty\nof a second sovereign. So when one is now looking at the\n-- at the issues of sovereign immunity, one is looking at\na different platform of issues and also at a different\nhistorical base.\nQUESTION: But that seems to make their case\neven harder. It would be difficult to conceive that the\nframers thought that Virginia could be sued in\nPennsylvania but not in a federal court. I would think\nthat the presumption would be that this was an even\nstronger case for the exercise of sovereign immunity than\nwhen all of the citizens of the union are involved as in\nthe Alden situation --\nMR. FARR: Well, I think that --\nQUESTION: -- in the Eleventh Amendment.\nMR. FARR: I mean, I think that there are two\nthings going on.\nnot whether they can be sued, but if not, why not. For\nexample, with Pennsylvania and Virginia, as I'm sure the\nCourt is aware, had a -- Nathan versus Virginia is a case\nin which that very situation came up. But in the courts\nof Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Attorney General urged\nits own courts to recognize sovereign immunity. So that\ncould naturally fit within the idea that Schooner Exchange\nhas made clear, which is that when you're talking about\nco-equal sovereigns of that nature, one is talking about\nsovereignty that -- excuse me, immunity that is extended\nas a matter of comity, not as a matter of absolute right\nof the other sovereign. And the reason is -- excuse me --\nthe reason is that if you don't allow the sovereign to\nexecute its own laws within its own territory, you're\ndepriving that sovereign of part of its sovereignty.\nQUESTION: Well, doesn't our original\njurisdiction as the states between states bear something\non this question?\nMR. FARR: It bears a little bit. But, of\ncourse, Article III itself is not a exclusive jurisdiction\nprovision. The Section 1251 provides exclusive\njurisdiction with respect to suits between states.\nQUESTION: The idea that the framers would\nprovide for its original jurisdiction in the Supreme Court\nin -- for suits by one state against another suggests they\nthought it might be pretty hard to bring such a suit\nanywhere else.\nMR. FARR: Well, and they -- certainly as a\npractical matter, they would have been right, Mr. Chief\nJustice. I mean, as a practical matter, it has always\nbeen difficult to bring a suit against a state, either in\nits own courts or in the courts of another state. I mean,\neven since Nevada versus Hall, typically states have\ngranted immunity to other states for when they're sued in\ntheir own courts. And if they haven't granted absolute\nimmunity, what they have done, which I think is an\nimportant principle emerging -- emerging principle of\ncomity, is they have tended to look at their own immunity\nto see what kinds of suits could be brought against them\nand to try, then, to grant to the -- to the outside\nsovereign that same type of immunity.\nQUESTION: Mr. Farr, have you found other\nexamples around the country of suits by citizens of one\nstate against another state in the other state's courts?\nMR. FARR: I --\nQUESTION: Is this relatively rare, or is it\nhappening? And in what context is it happening?\nMR. FARR: It's relatively rare, and -- but\nthere have been some suits. There are a few of them cited\nin our red brief, if I can find the page number, pages 38\nand 39. The -- there are suits, for example, negligence\nsuits involving the release of dangerous persons within\nanother state who have created injury to citizens --\nQUESTION: Uh-huh.\nMR. FARR: -- of that state. There are more\ncommercial-type things involving contracts or -- one, in\nparticular, is a it for invasion of privacy when someone\nwho wrote a book disclosed information. In general,\nthough, Justice O'Connor, as I say, some of those suits,\nthe courts have just said, we're not going to hear them\nwhether you have a valid cause of action or not. We're\nsimply not going to -- going to recognize that in our\ncourts because of the sovereignty of the defendant. Other\ncourts have said, yes, we will open our courts, but we are\ngoing to look to our own immunity to try to have\nessentially a baseline to measure the sort of immunity\nthat we are going to --\nQUESTION: Mr. Farr, are you saying --\nMR. FARR: -- accept.\nQUESTION: -- that that, too, is just a matter\nof comity?\nMR. FARR: I do think that that's --\nQUESTION: Doesn't --\nMR. FARR: -- just a matter --\nQUESTION:\nImmunities Clause of Article IV have something to say? If\nyou can treat a tax collector from California differently\nfrom the tax collector in Nevada, you're not giving their\ntax collectors equal privileges and immunities in Nevada.\nMR. FARR: If one granted lesser immunity? Is\nthat the question --\nQUESTION: Yes. If one -- you said that the\nonly stopper was a notion of comity, and I'm suggesting\nthat you might not be able to treat two officials, one\nfrom out of state, one from in state, to treat -- to favor\nthe in-state official. But maybe Privileges and\nImmunities have -- has something to do with that.\nMR. FARR: If a state is entitled as a defendant\nto invoke Privileges and Immunities against the courts of\nanother state, I would think that's right. Certainly in\nthe case --\nQUESTION: Is it?\nMR. FARR: I --\nQUESTION: I mean, I thought --\nMR. FARR: I would have thought not.\nQUESTION: -- that would go to individual\nliability, but it would -- it would not affect this\nquestion, but I may be wrong.\nMR. FARR: Well, no, I -- that would be my\nassumption, also, Justice Souter.\nPrivileges and Immunities and Equal Protection are -- are\nprovisions that apply to individuals who are claiming\ndiscrimination in -- in another state. I don't think they\nwould apply directly to a state.\nBut, as I say, the -- the notion that comity is\n-- is something that -- that doesn't have a force, even\nthough it's not federal enforceable, it seems to me is a\nlittle bit of a misperception. Because, again, if one\ngoes back to the notion of the law of nations or separate\nsovereigns, comity essentially has been the provision that\ngoverns their relations since well before the convention.\nQUESTION: Well, there is some reluctance to say\nthat California officials can run amok in Nevada without\nNevada being able to do anything about it. I suppose if\nit were a pervasive practice, Nevada might be able to sue\nCalifornia in the original jurisdiction under some parens\npatriae theory. I'm not sure about that.\nMR. FARR: Well, I mean, let me suggest a couple\nof other possibilities, Justice Kennedy, as well. I don't\n-- I don't know whether the court would take original\njurisdiction of that question or not, but, I mean, the\nmost direct example of something states could do,\nobviously, is they could reach agreements between\nthemselves. I mean, there have been two cases before this\ncourt involving suits against states in the courts of\nother states. One was Nevada in California's courts.\nThis is California in Nevada's courts. If those states,\nwho are neighboring states, feel that this is an issue\nthat they need to address, they could reach some sort of\nagreement and, therefore, have reciprocal legislation.\nAnd, for example, under the Full Faith and\nCredit Clause for years, as the Court may know, there is a\ndoctrine that said that states didn't have to enforce the\npenal laws of another state, even though Full Faith and\nCredit, on its face, would make you feel that maybe they\nwould have to.\nBut, in fact, states eventually began, through\nreciprocal agreements in decisions, and I think in\nlegislation also, to say, you know, we essentially will\nenforce the penal laws or the tax laws of other states, so\nlong as they do for us. So, again, the states --\nQUESTION: Penal laws or penal judgments?\nMR. FARR: No, no, penal judgments, the court\nsaid in -- in Milwaukee County, have to be enforced, but\nthey -- they distinguished at that point, Mr. Chief\nJustice, the idea that a law itself would have to be\nenforced before it had been reduced to --\nQUESTION: Right, but what -- what -- what is\nthe -- I don't want to -- I don't want you to get\ndistracted, because I thought Justice Ginsberg and maybe\nJustice Kennedy and I were driving at the same problem,\nwhich is that imagine Nevada v. Hall is good law. All\nright, now, the question comes up, How do you prevent\nNevada from going wild? All right. And so now we have\nseveral answers: (a), Congress can pass a statute --\nMR. FARR: Correct.\nQUESTION: -- (b) interstate compacts -- that\nwas what you were suggesting.\nMR. FARR: And -- and --\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. FARR: -- if I may --\nQUESTION: Yeah, the --\nMR. FARR: -- if I may intercede, it doesn't\nnecessarily even have to be a compact. I'm not sure --\nQUESTION: Right, some --\nMR. FARR: -- it's agreements that have to be\nproven.\nQUESTION: -- kind of a voluntary action by the\nstates.\nMR. FARR: Right, correct.\nQUESTION: (c) Privileges and Immunities, which\nhas the problem that it refers to citizens and not states,\n(d) equal protection doesn't work, I don't think, because\nit says, again, citizens. A due process clause, is a\nstate a person under the Due Process Clause?\n(e), what's (e)? I mean, you see? If Nevada --\n(e) is, of course, footnote 24, but then that gets us into\nthe National League of Cities problem. And so National\nLeague of Cities --\nMR. FARR: Well, there could --\nQUESTION: -- that -- that -- that approach --\nequal -- no, Privileges and Immunities, due process of\nlaw, voluntary action states, Congress enacts a law,\nanything else? Have we got -- is that the exhaustive list\nthat we must choose from?\nMR. FARR: It's --\nQUESTION: Or --\nMR. FARR: -- it seems exhaustive --\nQUESTION: And the only -- all right, that's --\nif -- if nothing in that list works, then the only\nalternative is overrule Nevada v. Hall.\nQUESTION: Is --\nQUESTION: -- or, excuse me --\nQUESTION: -- is comity on the list?\nMR. FARR: Well, comity --\nQUESTION: Well, I mean -- I mean I --\nMR. FARR: -- excuse me -- comity is --\nQUESTION: Comity -- comity is not the answer to\nthe problem, because -- well, it is, in a sense. It is,\nin a sense.\nMR. FARR: Yeah, I mean --\nQUESTION: Voluntary restraint.\nMR. FARR: Excuse me. I don't -- I certainly\ndon't mean to minimize the theoretical possibility that\nsuits in courts of one state could ultimately prove to be\na problem, generally. What I'm suggesting is that there\nis nothing, first of all, in the history of the Full Faith\nand Credit Clause that would suggest that once a state has\nproper legislative jurisdiction, as I think everybody\nconcedes that Nevada does here, that somehow that clause\nwas intended to displace the law of that state simply\nbecause another state had made different policy choices\nabout, let's say, here, compensation and immunity.\nQUESTION: But can you say that categorically\nand absolutely? I mean, there are all sorts of\npermutations of facts that could come up.\nMR. FARR: Well, what -- the permutations of\nfacts, I think, go particularly to what constitutes\nlegislative jurisdiction. So perhaps in that sense, my\nstatement is broader, or seems broader in the context of\nthis case than I mean it to be. But I do -- but I do\nthink, in general, that I don't see any warrant in the\nFull Faith and Credit Clause, given the fact that it was\nenacted with very little debate, and almost all of the\ndebate was about judgments and not about enforcement of\nother states' laws, I think it would be stretching the\nclause beyond recognition to say that at some point it was\n-- it was telling states, you're going to have to set your\nlaws aside and apply the laws of another state.\nQUESTION: There was a time in the '30s and '20s\nwhen this court came pretty close to that, the cases that\npreceded Pacific Employers.\nMR. FARR: That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Clapper and Bradford.\nTHE COURT Yes.\nMR. FARR: That's correct. And as I think that\nas my argument might suggest, I think the Court was\ncorrect to essentially back away from that kind of\nbalancing test and essentially go back to the principle of\nsaying when a state is competent to legislate, then it may\napply its own laws, leaving the additional questions about\nwhat might happen at that point to questions of comity\nwhere a state is the defendant. And, as I've suggested,\nNevada courts have shown considerable comity already here,\nand the case, of course, is not yet concluded.\nQUESTION: Comity is something like a hearty\nhandshake. I mean, it -- it's something that you can't\nput any -- any force to.\nMR. FARR: That's -- that's true in one sense,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nthere's no federally enforceable state law of comity, I --\nthat's true. But at the same time, I mean, the Court's\ndecisions about comity since back in the late 18th century\nhave emphasized that it is a serious doctrine. It's a\ndoctrine built of respect for -- for other sovereigns.\nAnd in particular -- and I think this -- this is -- also\ngoes to the practical problem that Justices Kennedy and\nBreyer are asking about -- it also does have a healthy\nmeasure of self interest in it.\nI mean, when -- when you are talking about co-\nequal sovereigns, any sovereign that is exercising\njurisdiction over another sovereign understands that\nthat's -- the first sovereign -- or the second sovereign\nhas the same power and authority over it.\nQUESTION: Is -- is the question of comity one\nthat has a federal component so that this court should\nweigh in on when it has to be exercised?\nMR. FARR: I don't believe so state versus\nstate, Justice O'Connor. Or course, in the -- in the\ntypes of cases that the board was referring to this\nmorning, like McNary, there are comity elements. And\nthere -- and there is a jurisprudence of this court with\nrespect to federal and state relations which does depend\non comity, and that is, of course, federally enforceable.\nI don't believe that there is a concomitant enforceable\ndoctrine\nQUESTION: But you're arguing --\nMR. FARR: -- state to state.\nQUESTION: Even in the face -- even in the face\nof some development by state -- a state court that seems\ntotally out of whack with our constitutional structure?\nMR. FARR: Well, Justice O'Connor, I suppose I\nshould --\nQUESTION: Are there no extremes? Is there no\nlimitation?\nMR. FARR: Well, I -- I mean, I'm -- I suppose I\nshould pause in the sense that -- that if there is\nsomething that is so threatening to the constitutional\nstructure and something for which there is no historical\nbasis in -- in terms of the -- the way that sovereigns\ndeal with each other. Now, see, that's -- that's where I\nthink this case is very different, because even though\nthere was certainly a practical tradition that states were\nnot to be sued in other states, as I say, since Schooner\nExchange, and, indeed, in Verlinden in 1980, this Court\nhas always taken the position that when you're talking\nabout relationships between sovereigns, and they're co\nequal sovereigns, and the issue is immunity between them,\nthat is a matter of comity.\nQUESTION:\ncase, I can easily see on your theory writing the part of\nthe opinion that says the acts in Nevada, the acts in\nNevada that were arguably torts are certainly up to Nevada\nto pursue. But the discovery commissioner here, they say,\nwent way too far in ordering discovery and ordered\ndiscovery that would have been relevant only to negligent\naction and only negligent action, really, that took place\nin California, though a Nevada resident was at issue. And\nthey can't do that, says the opinion, because -- because\n-- and now this is where it seems to me there -- something\n-- what do I fill that blank with. They can't do that.\nThey can't go over and, in Nevada, complain about\nnegligent action as this discovery commissioner may have\ndone, negligent action in California aimed at a Nevada\nresident where it's a tax action. They can't do that\nbecause -- and now what? You see -- do you see what's\nbothering me?\nI -- at this point, it seems to me there has to\nbe something in the Constitution that limits that, and\nthis case may raise that problem because of the actions of\nthe discovery commissioner. And, therefore, I think I\nneed something to fill that blank with.\nMR. FARR: Well, as -- I don't think, to start\nwith, that the answer is the Full Faith and Credit Clause.\nQUESTION: All right, what is it?\nMR. FARR: I mean --\nQUESTION: I -- it's an odd -- an awkward\nvehicle, Full Faith --\nMR. FARR: Right.\nQUESTION: -- but what is the answer?\nMR. FARR: Well, I mean, I still think that, in\nthe end, the answer is that this is a matter that one\ntrusts to the judgment of states --\nQUESTION: So the answer is if they want to do\nthat, they can do it.\nMR. FARR: -- that if, in fact, there is a\nquestion about discovery, that --\nQUESTION: Uh-huh.\nMR. FARR: -- I mean, that I -- accepting the\ncharacterization, although I dispute it to some extent,\nbut to the extent there's a question about discovery, that\nis simply part and parcel of the states being able to\nexercise their jurisdiction. I don't --\nQUESTION: I thought discovery was --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: -- interlocutory. I thought that we\ncouldn't write in an opinion, as Justice Breyer has\nsuggested, if I didn't think that that question was\ncurrently reviewable.\nMR. FARR:\nspecifically in the question presented about discovery.\nThe -- the -- the -- again, to come back to the question\npresented, because we've discussed a wide range of issues,\nmost of which I don't think are within the question\npresented, but when we come back to the question\npresented, the question is basically was the Nevada or the\nNevada courts required to dismiss this action on summary\njudgment because of California's law of immunity? And --\nand the reason for that is because, according to\nCalifornia, the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires\nNevada to enforce California's law of immunity.\nQUESTION: Mr. Farr --\nMR. FARR: Our view is -- yeah?\nQUESTION: -- do I understand -- your comity\nargument basically is -- it's kind a self-executing thing,\nbecause each time a state has to answer the comity\nquestion, it asks the question, what would I do if the\ntables were reversed? And as history teaches us, they\ngenerally treat the other sovereign the way they would\nwant to be treated themselves. And that's --\nMR. FARR: Well --\nQUESTION: -- well, that's the rule that seems\nto have been developed without any overriding\nconstitutional command order here.\nMR. FARR:\nin fact, they have become more specific in applying\ncomity, I believe, in saying we want to treat the other\nsovereign as we do treat ourselves, not just as we want to\nbe treated. We are treating the other sovereign the way\nwe treat ourselves.\nQUESTION: What if the -- what if the case came,\nand they didn't do it? Justice Breyer's question, how do\nI fill in the blank? I -- if, let's say, through this\nintrusive discovery process, systematically applied, they\nreally were interfering with California's taxation,\ncouldn't California bring an original action to enjoin\nthis interference?\nMR. FARR: I certainly think that's possible.\nAnd, of course, as I've said, I mean, California can try\nto talk to Nevada and try to reach agreement at a\nsovereign level about this, or if, in fact -- the Full\nFaith and Credit Clause has a specific express commitment\nto Congress of the right to declare the effects of other\nlaws.\nQUESTION: What would be the underlying --\nQUESTION: Underlying --\nQUESTION: -- substantive law in Justice\nSouter's proposed original action?\nMR. FARR: The -- I suppose, I mean, based on\nwhat California has said before -- said up to now, it\nwould bring it under the Full Faith and Credit Clause,\nthat it would say that there is some requirement --\nQUESTION: Well, but we wouldn't need an\noriginal action for the Full Faith and Credit Clause. If\nthat's so, it could apply in this case.\nMR. FARR: That's correct. I mean, whether\nthey're --\nQUESTION: So what's the -- what would an\noriginal action -- there was -- there's no underlying\nsubstantive standard to apply?\nMR. FARR: I mean, the question would be, is\nthere -- obviously, the question that's being raised. I\nam not aware of the federal substantive standard --\nQUESTION: We haven't --\nMR. FARR: -- that says --\nQUESTION: -- in boundary cases, though,\nadopted, as a federal rule, something maybe different from\nthe law of either state.\nMR. FARR: That's correct. Now, you do have --\nthere are certain cases, in fact, in which you can't have\noverlapping jurisdiction, where you can't own the same\nwater, you can't own the same land, you can't escheat the\nsame property. So that's true. The court has addressed\nthose kinds of cases.\nIn a situation where you're simply saying\nanother state is applying its laws, I prefer that they\napply our laws, and I'm troubled by the discovery that\nthey have -- they have allowed in applying their own laws,\nI'm not sure what the federal principle --\nQUESTION: It's not simply that --\nMR. FARR: -- is that entitles you to stop it.\nQUESTION: -- it's a prior action pending.\nThat's what makes this case different, and one of the\nthings that makes it different from Nevada v. Hall. Why\nis it -- is the California proceeding ongoing? Isn't it\nnormal for a second court to stay its operations so it\nwon't interfere with that prior action?\nMR. FARR: It -- in fact, the Nevada court\ndismissed the declaratory judgment action precisely\nbecause it didn't want to get into the question that was\nat issue in the California proceeding.\nQUESTION: Yes, but what about the intrusive\ndiscovery?\nMR. FARR: Well, most of the -- most of the\nother material -- with one exception, most of the other\nissues involved things that have nothing to do with the\nmerits of the California inquiry. I mean, whether\nconfidential information has been improperly disclosed has\n-- is not -- does not require you to adjudicate the\nCalifornia tax liability in order to understand that. The\nonly thing that has any bearing that is close to that, I\nsubmit, is something that is roughly akin to like a\nmalicious prosecution suit. And tort law itself, over\ntime, takes care of that. We've not gotten to that issue\nyet in the Nevada Supreme Court.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Farr.\nMr. Leatherwood, you have five minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FELIX LEATHERWOOD\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. LEATHERWOOD: Thank you, Your Honor.\nIn this particular case, I'd like to go back to\nJustice Breyer's thumbscrew example. I don't think the\nFull Faith and Credit Clause would actually force Cal --\nforce Nevada to apply -- apply a California thumbscrew\nstatute, because that would actually be outside the tax\nfunction.\nWhat I'm saying in this particular case what has\nhappened is that Nevada's failure to give us back to\nCalifornia's immunity statute has resulted in interference\nwith California's tax system. If this court does not\nintervene and give us back to our particular proposed\ntest, which would look into California to see whether or\nnot we would grant immunity, then essentially that would\npermit any defendant any form of taxpayer to run to the\nborder and literally sue the State of California or any\nother state to prevent the enforcement of that particular\nstatute.\nIn addition, I pointed out that this gives\nanother state the power to intrude into the actual\noperation of another state, and that's what has happened\nhere.\nThere has been some -- some discussion as to\nwhether or not Nevada has legislative jurisdiction. We\nconcede that they have legislative jurisdiction over the\ntort. But we -- what we complain about is that they won't\nrespect our legislative jurisdiction or our tax process\nover our immunity laws, and that is our particular\ncomplaint.\nWe submit the case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,\n"
