        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in Number 91 -- or rather, 01-963, Norfolk & Western\nRailway Company versus Freeman Ayers.\nMr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIn 1997, this Court recognized that there is an\nasbestos litigation crisis confronting the Nation, and\nnothing in the last five years has -- done anything other\nthan to show that that crisis is more acute now than at\nany other time in our history. The Rand Corporation in a\nreport just two months ago concluded that there are now\n6,000 defendants confronted with asbestos litigation\nclaims, that the estimated value of those claims in\nlitigation costs exceeds $200 billion.\nThe six plaintiffs who are involved in this\ncase, the respondents here today, are emblematic of at\nleast a fundamental element of the problem that confronts\nasbestos litigation. Each of them received close to, and\nin some instances more than a million dollars in\ncompensatory damages for claims of asbestosis. The basis\nfor their claim, the primary basis for their claim was\nthat they confronted a fear of cancer.\nAsbestosis does not convert into cancer --\nQUESTION: How do we know that? I mean, I\nnotice that the awards there seem to grow with age, and\nthey don't seem to vary depending upon smoking. I mean,\nthey're inversely related to age, they don't seem to be\naffected by smoking, and that suggested to me that maybe\nit didn't play a major part, this fear of cancer. How do\nwe know that it played a major part?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, there is a legal answer and\nthere is a factual answer. The legal answer is that you\nhave to assume it because the jury was instructed to\ninclude it as an element, and under West Virginia law, it\nis absolutely settled and respondents don't contest it.\nQUESTION: Well, but that, the fact that it's\none element doesn't mean it's the primary element, does\nit? They did all suffer physical impairment as a result\nof the asbestosis itself, did they not?\nMR. PHILLIPS: They all suffered asbestosis, and\nthey all suffered some physical elements of it.\nQUESTION: And how do you know that the physical\nimpairment was not the primary ingredient in the jury\nverdict. I don't understand that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't know that it's not the\nprimary ingredient, Justice Stevens. What I do know is\nthat as a matter of law, you can't ignore the fact that\nthe -- that fear of cancer was put before the jury as a\nsignificant component of the plaintiff's case in chief,\nthat the jury was instructed to include that, and that --\nQUESTION: Yes, but you said it was the primary\nelement of damages, and that's what I think Justice Breyer\nand I are wondering whether the record really\nsupports that element --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the record supports\nit in the sense that we know that these are asbestosis\nclaims that even the respondents' expert testified were\nmild, for the most part. One or two differences about\nthat, but these are still relatively mild asbestosis\nclaims, and mild asbestosis claims do not typically\ngenerate million-dollar damages awards --\nQUESTION: Did the defendant --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- particularly where there's no\ncost of medical care as part of the component.\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips, did the defendant\nattempt to test this by seeking a special verdict so that\nthe damages could be broken down by the jury? This was a\ngeneral verdict, so we don't know how much they gave for\nanything.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, the defendants didn't -- the\ndefendant did not ask for that.\nQUESTION: But it could have --\nMR. PHILLIPS: What the defendant did ask for,\nJustice Ginsburg, was to have fear-of damages eliminated\nas a component of the case in a case like this --\nQUESTION: But they could have -- if they tested\nthis, isolated this, and then we'd know how much was\nactually allocated, whether it was as he initially said\nthe primary, or whether it was a lesser thing. We just\ndon't know.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, and that's because it's the\nplaintiff's burden. If they didn't want to have -- if\nthey didn't want to take the risk of a general verdict\nbeing set aside because there's an element of damages\nthat's included that the court ultimately decides should\nbe excluded as a matter of law, they then bear the risk\nand the burden of having the case sent back for a new\ntrial.\nQUESTION: Oh, but the relevance of this, I\nthink your overall point, in my mind, is that the other\nside would say, I think they do say that this is a case in\nwhich there was an impact, and as a result of the\nimpact -- the thickening of the lungs -- the person does\nhave a fear of getting cancer greater than most people,\nthat that's -- entitles them under traditional law to some\ndamages, and where you can get a special verdict, it's\neasy to see, if the jury has awarded too much damage for\nthat, in which case you get a reversal under -- you get a\nreversal if they give too much for it, and -- so what's\nthe problem here that has anything to do with there being\n6,000 plaintiffs and enormous damage and problems overall?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the problem's easy to\nidentify, that is that if the instruction is that everyone\nwho suffers a diagnosed case of asbestosis is entitled to\ngo to the jury on fear of cancer claims, then the amount\nof damages that will be generated as a consequence of that\nwill run completely out of sync --\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. PHILLIPS:\nQUESTION: Why would it? Why -- maybe they're\nentitled to some fear. A person who has no problem in the\nworld has a 1 in 4 chance of dying in cancer. A person\nwho's subjected to asbestos may have a 1 in 3 chance.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But this Court --\nQUESTION: That gives them entitlement to some\nlittle amount, anyway.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer, you said, or the\nCourt said in Buckley that you don't analyze these issues\ncase by case. What you have to do is make a judgment\nabout the category of cases that's based on the policies\nof the Federal Employers Liability Act, and the policy --\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips, under West Virginia\npractice, is it -- if a plaintiff or a defendant requests\na special verdict, is it automatically allowed, or is it\nin the discretion of the trial court?\nMR. PHILLIPS: It's in the discretion of the\ntrial court, and it is also clear under West Virginia law\nthat if two theories are put before the jury with respect\nto damages and one of them is impermissible, the answer is\nyou strike down and you get a new trial on damages, so\nthat's -- that's clear. And I don't -- I don't hear the\nrespondents as arguing anything to the contrary.\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips, do we look at this case\nas one of a claim for traditional pain and suffering\ndamages? Is that how we should view it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. This Court said in Gottshall\nthat pain and suffering damages are describable as\nsensations stemming directly from a physical injury or\ncondition.\nThe physical injury that -- that's identified\nhere is asbestosis, and to be sure, the pain and suffering\nthat an asbestotic would be allowed to recover for might\nbe a fear of shortness of breath or other symptoms that\narise out of asbestosis, but the notion that cancer that\ndoesn't exist currently, may never take place, stems from\nthe existence of asbestosis is not a fair application of\nthat rule of law, particularly when there is no evidence,\nand again, I don't think respondents challenge this, that\nasbestosis does not cause cancer, it does not lead to\ncancer.\nQUESTION: But, it sounds like you want us to\nsay there is some limitation on the availability of pain\nand suffering damages in the context of an asbestosis\ncase.\nMR. PHILLIPS: All -- Not --\nQUESTION: It would be something different than\none would think of in a traditional pain and suffering\ncase, wouldn't it?\nMR. PHILLIPS:\nrespondents who are asking you to do something different\nwith a pain and suffering case, and actually I'm not even\nsure that's a fair way to characterize the respondents'\nargument. I don't understand them to be arguing that this\nis a classic pain and suffering --\nQUESTION: Well, I'm trying to find out what\nyou're arguing.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, and my argument is, this\nis not under any circumstances the kind of pain and\nsuffering that we traditionally think of. It's not\nsomething that emanates directly out of the existing\ninjury. Second, it's not negligent infliction of\nemotional distress, and it's not emotional injury as a\ncomponent of a negligence claim.\nQUESTION: Well, what was it -- was the case\npresented as a separate claim for negligently-caused\nemotional distress?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. It was --\nQUESTION: No. It was a pain and suffering\nargument. That's what it was, wasn't it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it wasn't clear exactly\nwhat it was until the jury -- until we got to the jury\ninstructions. At that point, the trial judge did say, I\nview these as pain and suffering.\nQUESTION: As pain and suffering.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nQUESTION: I mean, I thought that's what we were\nconfronting here.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, except that the traditional\nstandard for pain and suffering doesn't permit the kind of\ndisconnect between the fear of cancer that you're talking\nabout here and asbestosis. You normally associate pain\nand suffering as sensations that emanate directly from the\ninjury itself, and fear of cancer doesn't emanate at all\nfrom asbestosis.\nQUESTION: But it can include fright.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Fright from asbestosis --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- to be sure.\nQUESTION: Is it conceded -- I think you said it\nwas conceded, but is it conceded that fear of cancer does\nnot emanate from asbestosis? If it's clear that you have\na greater risk of cancer if you have contracted\nasbestosis, why isn't the fear connected to the\nasbestosis?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it's interesting, you know,\nthe testimony itself was simply, do you have a fear\nbecause of exposure to asbestos now that you have\nasbestosis. They didn't even ask the question whether the\nfear arises out of the asbestosis.\nQUESTION: Did you ask questions about the\ncausation theory that you're now espousing?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. Our argument, Justice\nSouter, was that fear of cancer is too unrelated, as a\nmatter of law, to be an element of pain and suffering.\nQUESTION: Okay, but I take it your argument is\nthat the mere fact that there is an association between\nasbestosis and a higher risk of developing cancer,\ndepending on whether you smoke and so on, is not enough of\nan association to support a -- in effect, a separate\nelement of damages for fear of cancer?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: What is your authority for that? In\nother words, you're saying there's got to be some kind of\na different, or more intense causal relationship than\nsimply this association that can statistically be shown.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think --\nQUESTION: What's the basis for that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Buckley, frankly, is as close to\nanything on that score, because Buckley says even if you\naccept as an article of faith, as I think the Court did,\nthat each of those individuals who'd been exposed to\nasbestos felt that he or she would be more seriously at\nrisk --\nQUESTION:\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, none of the --\nQUESTION: No --\nMR. PHILLIPS: No.\nQUESTION: -- they didn't, and the point here\nis that there is proof of asbestosis, and there is a\nstatistical showing that you don't deny, I think, of a\nhigher degree of risk, what -- however the causal chain\nworks -- which associates asbestosis with fear of cancer,\nso this is not a Buckley situation, and my question is,\nwhy isn't that statistical association sufficient to\nground an instruction allowing for compensation for fear\nthat results from this association?\nMR. PHILLIPS: There are two answers to that,\nJustice Souter. In the first place, the -- there is no\nstrong common law doctrine that says that those -- that\nthat kind of a disconnect between the damages is a core\nelement of what the common law routinely grants for --\nQUESTION: Well, you call it disconnect, he\ncalls it a connect. What it is, there is, I take it, an\nundenied statistical association between asbestosis and a\nprobability of developing cancer --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nQUESTION: -- and that's the basis for the claim\nof the fear. Why is that inconsistent with a common law\ntheory of pain and suffering damages?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the core of the pain and\nsuffering -- the pain and suffering theory is that it is a\nfright that emanates directly out of the particular\ncondition you have, which is asbestosis.\nQUESTION: All right, if you want to use that\nkind of terminology, I don't see why you haven't got it\nhere. The reason these people are worried is that they've\ngot asbestosis, and people with asbestosis have a higher\nchance of developing cancer. Isn't that enough out of, in\nyour terms?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. Even if you accept that\npremise, Justice Souter, you still have to confront the\noverall policies of the Federal Employers Liability Act,\nand the question of whether not allowing a recovery that\nmight otherwise be legitimate -- and that is precisely\nwhat the Court said --\nQUESTION: So, are you saying that even if the\ncommon law allowed it, we should not allow it under the\nact, or the act doesn't allow it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't think the common\nlaw clearly allows it.\nQUESTION: Okay. Have you got any authority for\nthat proposition --\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, because --\nQUESTION: -- that an association between these\ntwo conditions is insufficient to support a damage award?\nMR. PHILLIPS: There are lower court -- we cite\nthe Pennsylvania Supreme Court decisions, the Eleventh\nCircuit decisions -- there are decisions out there that\nhave said we're not going to allow fear of cancer in cases\ninvolving asbestosis, but I --\nQUESTION: Well, there does appear to be a\nminority of jurisdictions that have said -- and have\nheld -- that you have to show as a plaintiff in a case\nlike this a verifiable causal nexus between cancer and the\ninjury suffered in cases where you're dealing with\nexposure to a hazardous material. That -- maybe that's a\nreasonable requirement, but it appears to be a minority\nview. Are you suggesting that we should adopt that here?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm not asking you to -- I\ndon't think the answer to this case resides in the common\nlaw, because I think the common law is essentially a\nmuddle. There are cases on both sides.\nQUESTION: Well, are you -- do you think we\nshould adopt an interpretation of FELA that says there has\nto be some verifiable causal nexus?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely, Justice O'Connor, and\nthe reason to do that --\nQUESTION: Do you acknowledge that that is a\nview that is generally a minority view in the country?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- I -- I'll concede that it is\na minority view in the sense that there are maybe five\ncases on one side --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- and three or four on the\nother.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: This is not an area that's been\nlitigated sufficiently to be able to say where the trends\nare.\nQUESTION: It may make sense, but I just want to\nknow where we are here.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, I've only got two\nor three cases that identify it in the context -- the way\nyou just did, Justice O'Connor, and my colleague on the\nother side will identify four or five cases that don't\nimpose that requirement, but what remains absolutely\ncritical in the analysis of this case, I think, is the\ncore policy that this Court identified in Gottshall and in\nBuckley that says if you don't have a clear answer from\nthe common law, you have to look to see whether or not\nthis particular damages remedy creates the possibility of\nunpredictable and unlimited damages, and that's the reason\nwhy the Court needs to adopt a more restrictive view of\nthe standard to be applied under the Federal Employers\nLiability Act.\nThat may not be the rule that would be required\nas a matter of common law in any particular State, but\nunder FELA, the notion that you're going to create\nunlimited liability in circumstances in which the\nplaintiffs are allowed significantly reduced requirements\nin order to prove the basis for their claim suggests that\nthis Court has consistently taken the position that it\nmust cut back and not allow on a category basis -- on a\ncategorical basis -- not allow damages to extend to --\nQUESTION: But what -- I mean, what -- unlimited\ndamages, I don't know what you want us to do. What if the\nstatistical chance of your getting cancer if you have\nasbestosis is -- is your chances are doubled. Would that\nbe enough to create the kind of a fear that we could allow\ndamages for it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think so --\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: What if it's 90 percent certain that\nif you have developed asbestosis, you will develop cancer?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think that would be a different\ncase. I think once you get past more likely than not --\nQUESTION: Okay, so it's somewhere between 50\nand 90 percent?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think when you get past more\nlikely than not that you will incur cancer, there is a\nrisk, then at that point -- but remember, the flip side of\nthis is the two-disease rule, and that's an important\nelement in how the Court ought to analyze this problem,\nbecause not only -- by allowing fear of cancer damages\nnow, you essentially say to the world, the sky is the\nlimit, inconsistent with what the Court said in Gottshall\nand Buckley.\nThe flip side is, if you don't allow the fear of\ncancer damages now, but allow fear of -- but allow the\nplaintiff to come back after he or she contracts cancer\nand allows as a part of that recovery for fear of cancer,\nthen the people who are most seriously injured are made\nwhole at the appropriate time in the appropriate\ncircumstances.\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips, I know your light is\non, but there's a second question and you haven't even\ntalked about it, the joint and several liability --\nMR. PHILLIPS: The apportionment.\nQUESTION: -- the apportionment.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: And I wasn't sure that there was any\nsupport in the statute or in the evidence at trial here\nfor how some apportionment should have been made.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the quick answer on\napportionment is that in 1908, it was absolutely clear\nthere was several liability. You're only liable for the\ninjuries you cause. That's embodied, I think, in the\nstatutory language that says that the railroad is\nresponsible for the injuries while employed. That\nlanguage has been interpreted as recognizing we only pay\nfor the things that we cause.\nThe Third Restatement --\nQUESTION: Cause in whole or in part?\nMR. PHILLIPS: But that goes to the question of\nwhat you need to show a jury in order to get a negligence\nclaim to the jury in the first instance. It doesn't say\nyou're -- you're liable for the entirety of the damages in\nwhole or in part.\nQUESTION: It could be read to say that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: It could, but I don't think\nthat's the most natural reading of that particular\nlanguage, and I don't think it's an appropriate one where\nthe policies in 1908, and the policies of the law under\nthe Third Restatement quite clearly say that you should\napportion, because that is the fair way in order to ensure\nthat a defendant is not -- does not -- is not forced to\novercompensate.\nQUESTION:\nbear the burden of bringing in those other people. If\nit's joint and several, you could join other people. On\nyour view, you say to the plaintiff, \"Unless, plaintiff,\nyou bring in all these other people, you can only get a\nsmall piece from any particular one.\"\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, and I think the statute\nand the existing common law clearly suggest that the right\nanswer is that because you've reduced the burden of the\nplaintiff in order to get into court and to be able to\nmake a case, the quid pro quo for that ought to be that\nyou only hold the railroad liable for the amount of the\ninjury it caused, and here it is not contested that -- and\nMr. Butler's case is the prototype example of it -- he had\nthree months of exposure when he was with Norfolk &\nWestern, he had 30 years of exposure with others. That is\na reasonable basis on which to apportion for cause, and\nthat -- and no one has contested that.\nI'd reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Phillips.\nMr. Salmons, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. SALMONS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nRespondents may not recover damages under FELA\nfor their anxiety about developing cancer in the future as\npart of their emotional injuries from the separate disease\nof asbestosis. The overwhelming majority of courts that\nhave considered the relationship between asbestosis and\ncancer have concluded that they are separate diseases that\nresult in separate injuries to the plaintiff --\nQUESTION: May I ask in that --\nMR. SALMONS: -- and give rise to separate --\nQUESTION: May I ask this question? I really\nwanted to ask it of Mr. Phillips, but his time was running\nout. Would you draw a distinction between a case in which\nthe asbestosis actually is a cause of cancer, as opposed\nto a case like this, in which asbestos and cancer --\nasbestosis and cancer -- are the result of a common cause?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I do think there would\nbe a difference between those two instances. Here, the\nCourt can look to the evolving tort law principles in\ncases involving asbestos, where the overwhelming majority\nof courts have concluded they are, indeed, separate\ndiseases with no causal connection between them only in\nthe sense that they both stem from the same exposure --\nQUESTION: -- that in this\nMR. SALMONS: -- to asbestos.\nQUESTION:\ntrue, which I understand it is not, that the asbestosis\nitself is a contributing cause to cancer, that then there\nwould be liability?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, Your Honor, I think that --\nyou know -- the Court may still need to look at what\ntype -- what exactly the causal connection is -- and it\nwould still need to take into account both the text and\nthe purposes of FELA, and -- and in particular, the\nconcern --\nQUESTION: But taking all those things into\naccount, what do you do in a case in which the cancer is a\nresult of the asbestosis rather than the result of a\ncommon source?\nMR. SALMONS: I -- I do think, Your Honor, that\nif -- that if the cancer, in fact, results directly from\nthe disease of asbestosis, then that puts you more\ndirectly in the category of pain and suffering damages\nthat would be available traditionally in tort law, and\nthat probably would be recoverable there, but --\nQUESTION: Why --\nQUESTION: Isn't that a jury question? Do we\nknow for sure that the one does not lead to the other?\nMR. SALMONS: I do think, Your Honor, that this\nCourt can look to the experience of courts that have\nconsidered the relationship between the two diseases, and\nhave adopted legal rules to govern the disposition of\nthese claims, and have concluded that they are separate\ndiseases that result in separate injuries and give rise to\nseparate causes of action, and I think this Court can look\nto that and -- and -- and can conclude that as a matter of\nlaw both because of --\nQUESTION: Do the respondents agree with you on\nthat factual point?\nMR. SALMONS: That the majority of courts have\nconcluded --\nQUESTION: No -- no, that -- that asbestosis\ndoes not lead to cancer, but rather, is -- is produced by\nthe same -- by the same cause that produces cancer?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I do think that the\nrespondents have taken that position in this case. On\npage 20 of their brief, they say that the relationship\nbetween asbestosis and cancer is two-fold.\nFirst, the asbestosis confirms the extent and\nseverity of the initial exposure to asbestos which, of\ncourse, under Buckley is not a separate injury or impact\nthat can give rise to liability under FELA, and second,\nthat they both -- both the cancer and the asbestosis would\nresult from the same negligent conduct of the defendant,\nbut I do not read respondents to be alleging in this Court\nthat there is any causal relationship between cancer and\nasbestosis in terms of asbestosis actually turning into\ncancer.\nThere may be a correlation, but you know,\nthat -- the reasonableness of the fears is really not the\nquestion.\nQUESTION: The question I had is, if there is a\ncausal correlation, if 50 percent of the people who have\ncontracted asbestosis as a result of exposure to asbestos\nwill also contract cancer, why does that matter? That's\nwhat I didn't quite see.\nMR. SALMONS: I -- I think --\nQUESTION: Because I understand -- I think you\ndo correctly state their -- they agree with you on the\nfacts on this.\nMR. SALMONS: Yes, Your Honor. I think that in\nterms of -- of the existing tort law principles that, as\nthis Court noted in Gottshall, and even prior to that\naround the time of the enactment of FELA, that pain and\nsuffering damages are limited to those damages that flow\ndirectly from the injury that allows you to sue, and\nthat --\nQUESTION: But both of those cases were a self-\nstanding claim of emotional distress. It wasn't pinned to\nany existing injuries.\nHere, the difference, and at least as portrayed\nby the judge who made it part of pain and suffering, is\nyou do have an injury, you have the asbestosis, and one of\nthe elements of damages is pain and suffering, and this is\nincluded in pain and suffering. At least that's the way\nthe judge saw it, as distinguished from Buckley and\nGottshall, which were self-standing claims of emotional\ndistress not tied to any preexisting injury.\nMR. SALMONS: Yes, Your Honor, that is the way\nthe court below approached the question. We think the\nproblem with that is that, as the overwhelming majority of\ncourts that have considered the issue of the relationship\nbetween the diseases have concluded, they are separate\ndiseases that result in separate injuries and separate\ncauses of action, and the test of FELA --\nQUESTION: But doesn't it matter what form --\nI'm familiar with one of those cases, and that was the\nquestion --\nMR. SALMONS: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- when does the statute of\nlimitations start to run when you get the virulent form of\ncancer? Does it begin to run when you got the asbestosis,\nbecause that should have tipped you off and you should\nhave sued then?\nThe answer in that context, and there are many\ncourts that say that cancer is a separate claim, is not\nnecessarily what it should be in this context.\nMR. SALMONS: We do think it is instructive,\nhowever, Your Honor, and that's particularly true because\nFELA provides for liability -- to any person suffering\ninjury while employed -- for such injury, and we think,\nconsistent with the text of that statute, which limits the\nemployer's liability to the injury that's actually\nsuffered, and not the fear of suffering a future -- injury\nin the future -- that the rule we are propounding today is\nthe most consistent with that text and the most consistent\nwith the purposes and -- and policy considerations this\nCourt articulated in both Gottshall and Buckley, and in\nparticular --\nQUESTION: You did say -- you said in your brief\nthat it's a question of not whether, but when, because\nwhen you get cancer, if you get cancer, you get the\ndamages for past, present, and future pain and suffering,\nbut that's not quite right, is it, because you are leaving\nout the category of person who has asbestosis and never\ngets cancer, which will be most of these people? Those\npeople -- for them, it is a question of whether, not when,\nright?\nMR. SALMONS: It is true, Your Honor, that\npeople who now have asbestosis and fear getting cancer in\nthe future may never get cancer.\noverwhelming number of them won't get cancer --\nQUESTION: And then they --\nMR. SALMONS: But --\nQUESTION: -- they never -- they can never\ncollect for this alleged fear.\nMR. SALMONS: That is true, Your Honor, and\nthat's also true for the snowmen of Metro-North that were\nat issue in Buckley. The Court -- this Court did not say,\nthough, their fears were not reasonable. In fact, the\ncourt of appeals in that case had found that they were.\nWhat this Court said was, they didn't fit within\nthe common law categories that allowed recovery because\nthe exposure itself was not an impact or injury, and our\nposition is that while the asbestosis gives them an\nability to sue for their injuries related to that\nasbestosis, they cannot reach back to that initial\nexposure and recover the damages that were precluded in\nBuckley, namely --\nQUESTION: But here -- here we've got something\nmore. We've got the proof that this is a serious risk,\nand that proof consists of the fact that asbestosis has,\nin fact, developed.\nMR. SALMONS: That is correct, and they can\nrecover for all of their harms related directly to that\nasbestosis, but our position is they can't recover for\ntheir fears of the future disease of cancer --\nQUESTION: I know that that's your position, but\nonce we cross that threshold, as we have in this case --\nthe threshold that shows that the fear is, in fact, a\nserious one, because at least asbestosis has now\ndeveloped, why isn't their fear of cancer just as\nreasonable whether that fear rests upon the fact that in\n10 percent of asbestosis cases, the asbestosis progresses\nto cancer -- which isn't true -- or, on the other hand, in\nthe same percentage of asbestosis cases, cancer will also\ndevelop as a result of the common cause for which the\nemployer is liable?\nWhy is the fear any less reasonable in either of\nthose cases?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, with respect, we don't\nthink the question is whether their fears are reasonable,\nbut their question is whether their fears are recoverable\nat this time.\nQUESTION: Well, I know that, and one of the\nquestions we want to know in determining whether recovery\nis possible is whether the fear is reasonable.\nMR. SALMONS: And we do not --\nQUESTION: One threshold test that we all agree\non is, the fear has at least got to be confirmed by some\nphysical manifestation.\nOnce the physical manifestation is shown, why is\nreasonable fear -- why should reasonable fear -- not be\nenough for recovery, whether the causal connection goes\nfrom asbestosis to cancer, or common cause to cancer?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, we think that one of\nthe primary reasons why it should not be enough -- that\nreasonableness of the fear should not be enough in and of\nitself -- even assuming for a moment that the statistics\nthat are at -- that were in evidence here are, in fact,\nsufficiently conclusive to draw those assumptions -- I\nmean, I do think it's important to remember that this\nCourt in Buckley referred to these same types of figures\nas being uncertain and controversial, and I think that\nthat description is probably still true here.\nBut the purposes and policies of FELA, which\nthis Court recognized in Buckley, and in particular the\nfear that plaintiffs with relatively minor injuries now\nwill come into court being drawn by the opportunity to get\nfront-loaded, significant damages for future harms, will\nend up frustrating the system, and will end up hurting the\nplaintiffs that in fact develop cancer later, and I think\nthat this case implicates those policies and concerns of\nFELA and tort law generally just as much as was the case\nin Buckley, that the vast majority, the number of people\nthat will actually get cancer in the future is relatively\nlow, and there is a significant risk --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Salmons.\nMR. SALMONS: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Lazarus, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. LAZARUS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. LAZARUS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe only issue raised by the first question\npresented in the cert petition is whether the trial\ncourt's jury instruction correctly described the legal\nstandard for when a physically injured plaintiff can\nrecover for related emotional distress injury, and the\nsufficiency of the evidence and the jury's application of\nthat legal standard to the evidence at trial is not one of\nthe questions presented in this case, and it is quite\nclear that the --\nQUESTION: Well, the question presented doesn't\nspeak in terms of the instruction, as I read it.\nMR. LAZARUS: No, but the question poses a pure\nquestion of law, and that is whether, when you have a\nphysical injury, what the relationship has to be between\nthe emotional distress and the physical injury, and our\nargument, Your Honor, is that under traditional tort law,\nit is not required that the emotional stress immediately\naccompany the physical injury; that it have its own\nphysical manifestations; that it be severe.\nTort law, as this Court explained in the Metro-\nNorth case, approaches the recovery for emotional distress\ninjury from a categorical perspective, and tort law\ncategorically distinguishes between two different\nsituations.\nFirst, the situation where one has a stand-\nalone claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress\nwhere the emotional injury itself the element of the\noffense, the injury element, and second, the so-called\nparasitic damage context, where there is a threshold\nphysical injury which supplies the essential element, and\nwhat many courts do is they impose very significant\nlimitations on the recovery of emotional distress in the\nstand-alone context such as physical manifestations,\nimmediacy, and severity, but --\nQUESTION: And you say this case is not brought\non this theory?\nMR. LAZARUS: The jury instruction is reproduced\non page 573 of the joint appendix.\nQUESTION: Where do we -- 573?\nMR. LAZARUS: 573 on the joint appendix, and\nthat jury instruction makes it absolutely clear that\nrespondents were entitled to recover for their reasonable\nfear of cancer as part of their overall damages only to\nthe extent that that fear related to -- the Court's\nwords -- related to proven physical injury, and there is\nabsolutely no merit to petitioner's argument --\nQUESTION: Do some jurisdictions go further\nthese days and require there be a reasonable causal nexus?\nMR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, almost no\njurisdictions do. There are really only two cases --\nQUESTION: I thought there were a few that did.\nMR. LAZARUS: But almost all the cases go the\nother way, and the reason, Your Honor, is because --\nthere's some confusion in petitioner's argument here about\nwhat \"pain and suffering\" means. If you look at the jury\ninstruction very closely on page 573, the trial judge in\nthis case was very careful, knew exactly what he was\ndoing.\nIn the paragraph right before the \"fear of\ncancer\" paragraph, he refers to the entitlement of a\nphysically injured plaintiff to recover for physical and\nmental pain and suffering. In the next paragraph, where\nhe refers to reasonable fear of cancer, he refers only to\nmental pain and suffering, and this is a longstanding\ndistinction in tort law. Physical pain and suffering is\nthe kind of pain which is immediate and intimately\nassociated with the bodily injury.\nQUESTION: All that is true, what you say, but I\nfelt the question was open, and the reason that I thought\nit was open is because probably I once learned that this\narea of the law arose out of an English case where\nsomebody is watching a coffin fall off in an accident, and\nthe rule was that you can't recover unless something hits\nyou, but what you were recovering for was the coffin, and\nthe pain and suffering that a family member would feel.\nMR. LAZARUS: Right.\nQUESTION: That was immediate, directly related\nto the accident, and quite clearly present and measurable.\nMR. LAZARUS: Right.\nQUESTION: This is the kind of thing that is not\nimmediate. It's a fear of something way in the future.\nIt is very hard to determine whether it is right or wrong,\nand it has no causal relation to the physical thing, and\ntherefore, I thought that it's open.\nMR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, it's really --\nQUESTION: You want to say -- I'll look it up,\nbut if you were to say it's absolutely not open, I mean,\nthey have, you know, lots of briefs where they've made a\npretty good case it's at least open.\nMR. LAZARUS: It's open and shut.\nQUESTION: Oh, all right.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LAZARUS: If one looks to the Restatement of\nTorts, section 456, which ascribed -- well-settled, widely\napplied, and it describes the circumstances when a\nphysically injured plaintiff can recover for related\nemotional distress injuries. It fits this case, and it\nincludes in comment c, it expressly denies the validity of\ntheir physical manifestation requirements --\nQUESTION: No. I mean, you saw their reply\nbrief, and their reply briefed that is that the underlined\nphrase -- the italicized phrase -- or from conduct which\ncauses it, is not really what's at issue. What's issue\nare the words in that called \"emotional disturbance,\" and\nthe question is, what kind of emotional --\nMR. LAZARUS: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- disturbance, and I think that\ntheir argument is, which if I put numbers on it is, each\none of us in this room has 1 in 4 chance that we will die\nof cancer, and the difference between us and a plaintiff\nin this case is that he has a 1 in -- 1 in 5 -- 1 in 5 --\nwait -- We have 1 in 5, 1 in 5 and he has 1 in 4, and what\nthey're saying is, I think, that the difference between a\n1 in 5 chance of dying of cancer, and a difference of 1 in\n4 chance of dying of cancer is intangible -- hard to\nmeasure in anyone's psychology. Nobody really makes such\ndistinctions rational, and therefore don't open this up to\njuries awarding large amounts of money.\nMR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, one really can't in\nthe beginning start to entertain their evidence that\nthey've introduced which wasn't part of the trial record\nin this case. The trial record --\nQUESTION: No, I don't think their evidence is\nrelevant.\nMR. LAZARUS: Right.\nQUESTION: I would say this is a question that's\nbeing put to us as a matter of law.\nMR. LAZARUS: Right.\nQUESTION: And it is up to us to look at the\nnumbers.\nMR. LAZARUS: Right.\nQUESTION: And in reaching those numbers I gave\nyou, I've assumed everything in your favor. That is, it's\nreally -- because you're a railroad and not the kind of\nthing that was involved in the studies you cite -- it\ncould be a lot less than what I say, but it's not going to\nbe more.\nMR. LAZARUS: Well, actually, it may well be\nmore, but let's put that aside. What is quite clear, Your\nHonor, as this Court explained in the Metro-North case, is\nthat just because there are background risks, that doesn't\nmean that one can't have a reasonable apprehension based\non an increased risk.\nFor instance, it is 100 percent sure, Your\nHonor, that every one of us in this room will die. We\nhave a background risk. But the fact that someone through\nnegligent conduct causes us a physical injury which\nincreases our risk of dying sooner does not mean we can\nrecover for that.\nAnd the place to look in the Restatement of\nTorts, Your Honor, to see that this is a classic thing\nthat one can recover for, if you look to section 456, you\nlook to comment c, and then it referenced comment -- it\nreferenced Restatement section 905, and Restatement -- and\nit says that when you have a physical injury, then it\ntriggers the whole panoply of emotional distress injuries,\nand section 905 of the Restatement of Torts describes what\nis encompassed by \"emotional distress,\" and comment e\ndescribes how it goes, as always, to fear, anxiety,\napprehension of future consequences.\nQUESTION: Mr. Lazarus --\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Lazarus, what if you put a\nphysician on the stand, and the physician says, this man\nwas 25 years old when he was injured, he ordinarily would\nbe expected to live to be 75, but as a result of this\ninjury he's only going to live to be 72? Now, is that the\nsort of thing that's compensable?\nMR. LAZARUS: Well, Your Honor, I don't know.\nI don't know -- I don't doubt, Your Honor, that in tort\nlaw, that there is a level of probability of risk below\nwhich one can say as a matter of law there's not a\nreasonable apprehension. I don't think, though, in this\ncase, first of all, that there's any question that\nstatistics support a reasonable apprehension, but even\nmore importantly, the question whether they do or don't in\nthis case is not one of the issues here. The issue is\nwhether that's enough. The issue is whether you --\nQUESTION: Mr. Lazarus, may I ask you on that\npoint -- let's for a moment not think of ourselves as\nlawyers. Here are two people, the person in Buckley, the\nsnowman, and the person who has asbestosis, both of those\npeople may have a real fear of cancer, and we may find\nthem credible witnesses.\nI thought in the Buckley situation that one\nconcern is, it's too easy to make this up, and for some\npeople facing that risk, they'll say, \"Well, yeah, I might\nbe run over tomorrow, it doesn't bother me.\" Isn't the\nreal problem that the fear of something, when that fear\ndoesn't have the physical manifestation, that these things\nare too easy to make up, too uncontrollable, and I frankly\ncan't see the difference from the point of view of a\nsufferer between the person in Buckley and the person\nhere.\nThe person in the Grand Central Station case\ncould say \"I had the same fear that that person has. He\nhasn't proved his fear any more than I proved mine, why\nshould he recover and not me?\"\nMR. LAZARUS: Well, Your Honor, because as the\nCourt, I think, explained quite well in Buckley, the way\ntort law approaches the question is on a categorical basis\nand distinguishes between those with physical injury,\nbecause if you have that threshold physical injury, that\ngives you the corroborating evidence you need that you\nhave, now, a legitimate plaintiff -- a legitimate\nplaintiff -- who has established their cause of action.\nYou're not adding new cases to the docket, and even more\nimportantly, as the court has --\nQUESTION: Well, what's more legitimate -- and\nthere was no doubt about the conditions under which the\npeople worked in Grand Central Station -- that they were\nexposed to asbestos, that they should have been told much\nearlier about their exposure, and they must have been very\nangry that they weren't told.\nMR. LAZARUS: Well, Your Honor, first of all,\nthose who have asbestosis, as the trial record in this\ncase referred, those with asbestosis have a statistically\nhigher significance of getting the other kinds of cancers,\nbecause what -- it's not just a mere exposure, unimpaired,\nand what the asbestosis requirement does by requiring that\nkind of serious physical injury is, as everyone\nunderstood, and the rail industry argued in Metro-North,\nit dramatically limits the number of --\nQUESTION: Well, is there --\nMR. LAZARUS: -- possible plaintiffs.\nQUESTION: Mr. Lazarus, is their increased\nchance of cancer because they have asbestosis, or because\nthe asbestosis originates from their exposure to asbestos,\nand it's the exposure to asbestos, not the asbestosis,\nthat will cause cancer?\nMR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, we do not know, and no\none knows, whether the asbestosis itself transforms itself\ninto cancer.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- then you do challenge the\nstatement by your opponents that asbestosis itself cannot\nchange into cancer?\nMR. LAZARUS: No, Your Honor, their own\nexperts --\nQUESTION: Well, no, now, wait a minute --\nMR. LAZARUS: Yes. Yes. I --\nQUESTION: -- I asked you a question. What's\nthe answer?\nMR. LAZARUS: -- I do.\nQUESTION: You do challenge that?\nMR. LAZARUS: Their own expert, Your Honor, on\npage 470 of the joint appendix, Dr. Renn -- their\nexpert -- testified on page 470 that one could not\ncontract lung cancer from exposure to asbestos until one\nhad asbestosis.\nWe're willing to admit that the science is more\nunclear that asbestos -- whether it actually transforms\nitself or not, we don't know, and we don't think as a\nmatter of law it's necessary. It was their expert at\ntrial who testified that actually to get lung cancer from\nasbestos exposure, it was a necessary prerequisite to\nfirst have asbestosis. We think --\nQUESTION: Well, can I ask you one other --\nQUESTION: That question wasn't put to the jury.\nI mean, the fact is that the jury was not required to find\nthat the fear was a fear that the asbestosis would turn\ninto cancer.\nMR. LAZARUS: That's absolutely right, Your\nHonor. We -- and we think that was not an error in the\njury instructions. There's many cases out there -- let me\nrefer to this one case, a case they cite in their reply\nbrief on page 2 --\nQUESTION: Why wouldn't that be error? I mean,\nthe instruction does say that a plaintiff who's\ndemonstrated that he's developed a reasonable fear of\ncancer related to the proven physical injury from asbestos\ncan be compensated for the fear.\nMR. LAZARUS: Right, and it has to be related to\nthe proven physical injury, and it was in this case.\nIf I can give the example --\nQUESTION: But it's so -- in the same\ninstruction the court says, you cannot award damages for\ncancer or any increased risk of cancer.\nMR. LAZARUS: Right, Your Honor, and that's\nwhere the court got it actually --\nQUESTION: Which is so contradictory.\nMR. LAZARUS: No. No, it's not, Your Honor.\nWhat the court is doing here is exactly what courts do who\nadopt the separate disease rule which says, you can only\nrecover for your present injuries now, and you can't\nrecover for future injuries. The cancer itself, or the\nrisk, is a future injury.\nQUESTION: I was going to ask this. What if one\nof these -- if you prevail, and then one of these\nplaintiffs develops cancer, I assume he can go in and sue\nagain?\nMR. LAZARUS: That's right, yes, for the cancer.\nQUESTION: All right. Is there some kind of a\ndiscount now for the fear that he --\nMR. LAZARUS: No, no, just like there are\nseparate causes of action for assault and battery. Those\nare two different injuries. The apprehension of something\nis a separate injury, and for these plaintiffs -- the\nrespondents -- it is a current --\nQUESTION: So the fear that you're going to die\nof cancer is compensable before you get it, and it's\ncompensable again after you get it?\nMR. LAZARUS: No. No. The fear would not be --\nthe cancer would be --\nQUESTION: Oh, I thought that the -- you can\nrecover for the fear in both cases under your theory.\nMR. LAZARUS: I -- sorry, I wasn't -- if you've\nrecovered once, you aren't going to be allowed to recover\nagain.\nQUESTION: So there would be a discount.\nMR. LAZARUS: Yes. If you'd brought the\nfirst --\nQUESTION: All right. So then your first answer\nwas, you changed it from --\nMR. LAZARUS: I'm sorry. I thought your\nquestion was whether they could recover for cancer in the\nsecond one. I didn't understand you were referring to --\nQUESTION: Do we have cases in the law where you\ngive discounts for the first verdict?\nMR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, I'm not sure. I don't\nthink this issue has come up, but I don't think it's a bar\nto the recovery here.\nIf I can refer to the radiation burn case that\nthey referred to on page 2 of the reply brief --\nQUESTION: Well, but it indicates that maybe the\nrecovery now is problematic.\nMR. LAZARUS: No, Your Honor, it's not\nproblematic, because we have a present injury, and where\nyou have a present physical injury and you have a present\nemotional injury, an apprehension based on that, those are\ntwo types of injuries.\nQUESTION: Well, don't you think that emotional\nfear ought to be one that is reasonable?\nMR. LAZARUS: Yes.\nQUESTION: And a causal nexus there between the\nasbestosis and the fear?\nMR. LAZARUS: Well, Your Honor, we do think\nthere is a causal nexus --\nQUESTION: There should be, shouldn't there?\nMR. LAZARUS: We -- but we do think there's a\ncausal nexus here, and under the Restatement of Torts, all\nright, there are two different possible causal nexus under\nsection 456 of the Restatement. We actually think both of\nthose are met, and that is, we think that the fear is\ncaused by the physical injury. It's also caused by the\nsame negligent conduct, but that is also a sufficiency of\nthe evidence question, and what they are positing here is\nwhat the legal standard should be for physically injured\nplaintiffs and the recovery for related emotional stress\nharm.\nAn example, the Anderson case they cite on\npage 2 of their reply brief -- a radiation burn case --\nwhich they say is distinct from this case. It's exactly\nthe same as this case.\nQUESTION: I think you're right, and the dog\nbite cases support you, and the radiation cases support\nyou, and if it's cut-and-dried, as you say, then you win.\nBut if, when I look at all this stuff again, and\nI come to the conclusion -- if I were to come to the\nconclusion that it wasn't cut-and-dried, then I'm much\nmore at sea, and I want you to see why.\nOne was the reason I gave, which is the risk\nproblems, and the other, which is driving that, and I'd\njust like you to comment on this, is -- is my concern that\nif we begin to compensate people for fear of small changes\nin risks when the law doesn't -- is open on the point --\nwhat will happen in the asbestos cases, and that was their\ninitial point, is that we will -- there's $200 billion at\nstake, and the fund will run dry.\nWhen the people who really get the cancer come\ninto court, the cupboard will be bare, and I think that's\na serious policy problem, and it's worrying me quite a\nlot, and that's why I keep coming back to the open nature\nof this.\nMR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, I think that the way\nto address that kind of issue is not to change decades of\nsettled tort --\nQUESTION: Well, I say, is there any answer --\nMR. LAZARUS: Yes, there is.\nQUESTION: -- other than the law that is\nclear --\nMR. LAZARUS: There is. There is --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. LAZARUS: -- and what can be done in a case\nlike that is, the defendant in that case can request a\nverdict form which requires the jury to allocate out, and\nthat would allow a judge and an appellate, if appropriate,\nto review, and jury trials --\nQUESTION: Yes, but --\nMR. LAZARUS: -- trials, it happens all the\ntime.\nQUESTION: -- that isn't automatic in most\njurisdictions, Mr. Lazarus. You can't say \"I want a\nspecial verdict,\" and if the court says \"No, I don't think\nI'll give you one,\" that's pretty much the end of it,\nisn't it?\nMR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, they didn't request\none here, but that is the proper way to address the issue,\nand that's why you see --\nQUESTION: I don't understand what you're\nsaying. What -- allocate out -- how does that -- the\nmoney is still paid to this claimant, so that when the\nperson who actually has cancer comes into court, this\ncompany is bankrupt.\nMR. LAZARUS: No, but Your Honor, it addresses\nJustice Breyer's concern, and that is, it allows you to\nhave a record upon which one can make sure that the jury\nhasn't awarded a disproportionate amount based upon this\none element, that you don't have the tail wagging the dog.\nQUESTION: But what's disproportionate?\nQUESTION: What's disproportionate?\nQUESTION: Suppose you take one plaintiff who is\nvery nervous, very apprehensive, and for that person this\nincreased risk --\nQUESTION: Right.\nQUESTION: -- is going to be much more\naggravated. Then, take another person who's subject to\nthe same risk, but has a thicker skin and says, \"Well,\nI'll take it in stride.\"\nMR. LAZARUS: Well, Your Honor, it's a\nreasonable apprehension. This is why there's an objective\nstandard which applies to emotional recovery which doesn't\nrequire the physical. It has to meet an objective\nstandard.\nIf someone has a very, very thick skin in tort\nlaw and they, in fact, as a result of that, don't suffer\ndamage, then they haven't suffered damage. If they have a\nvery, very, very thin skin, and they suffer a lot of\ndamage, then they don't recover everything --\nQUESTION: When the person gets cancer --\nMR. LAZARUS: -- unless it's a reasonable\napprehension.\nQUESTION: If a person gets cancer -- and I take\nit you agree with the Government that such a person could\nget past, present, and future anxiety as part of pain and\nsuffering, but suppose that person had earlier had\nasbestos, and then brings his claim for lung cancer,\ncouldn't -- if you prevail today -- the defendant say\n\"Well, at least for the apprehension in the past, you know\nyou're precluded, because you could have brought that\nclaim when you got asbestosis\"?\nMR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, that might be\npossible. That is not an issue which has been addressed\nhere before this Court, and I haven't looked at the issue\npreclusion there between the two.\nWhat is clear is, if you have a current physical\ninjury --\nQUESTION: It would be claim preclusion.\nMR. LAZARUS: Yes, right, and it's not an issue\nwhich has been briefed here, because I think that when you\nhave a case like this with a present physical injury, and\nyou have a present emotional injury based on that, or as\nthis Court has actually said in Metro-North, related to\nthe physical injury, that's sufficient.\nI would like -- if -- to address the second\nissue, with the Court's --\nQUESTION: Before you do, may I ask one --\nQUESTION: Let me ask one -- please.\nQUESTION: Just one quick question. Do you\nagree with Mr. Phillips' appraisal of the facts as -- we\nshould assume that the fear of cancer was the major\nelement of damages?\nMR. LAZARUS: No, Your Honor. All one has to\nassume here is that there was sufficient evidence that a\nreasonable jury could give some money based on fear of\ncancer, not that they had to, and not, certainly, that\nthey gave $4.4 million, just sufficient evidence that a\nreasonable jury could have given a dollar, or some money.\nThat's all that would be necessary.\nThe second -- sorry.\nQUESTION: Was there testimony here that\nplaintiff A had heavy, or severe asbestosis and\nplaintiff B had mild, and was it based on any lung X-rays\nto show that this person's very badly infected and the\nother wasn't?\nMR. LAZARUS: Yes, Your Honor. There is --\nthere's lots of record evidence in this case to establish\nthe asbestosis and how there may have been different\ndegrees of asbestosis.\nQUESTION: All right, and since that's dependent\non dosage, why isn't this a case in which we can apportion\ncausation?\nMR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, for very simple a\nreason. The first reason is that we think that FELA\nitself on its face actually directs there to be joint and\nseveral liability when you have single injuries. That's\nour first argument, that FELA on its face answers the\nquestion, or that FELA provides that the railroad should\nbe liable, quote, \"for such injury or death resulting in\nwhole or in part from the negligence of the railroad.\"\nQUESTION: Correct me if I'm wrong, is it a\nprinciple of tort law that if causation can be\napportioned, that the injury is -- that there is then\nseveral liability on that tort --\nMR. LAZARUS: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: -- or am I wrong about that?\nMR. LAZARUS: No. The background principle of\nthe common law of torts here is that there are -- if there\nis a single injury, then there is joint and several\nliability unless there's a reasonable basis for\napportionment. Our threshold argument --\nQUESTION: And since asbestosis is peculiarly\nrelated to dosage and exposure, why isn't that a proper\nground for apportionment here?\nMR. LAZARUS: Assuming that FELA doesn't answer\nthe question, let me answer it based upon the common law.\nBecause the plaintiff has the burden -- sorry, the\ndefendant -- petitioner has the burden in that case to\nestablish 1) what the doses were, and 2) what the dose\nrelationship was, and the one thing we know here, the\nprototype example that Mr. Phillips referred to is\nMr. Butler, and the fact is that Mr. Butler apparently\nworked for three months exposed to asbestos for\npetitioner, and for many, many years exposed to asbestos\nat other workplaces.\nWhile we don't know what the dose relationship\nis, Your Honor, we do know for the record the one thing\nthe dose relationship isn't is time. One can't compare\none time to another.\nOn page 420 of the joint appendix, their expert testified\nthat one is far more likely to contract asbestosis from\nhigh concentrations over a short period of time than low\nconcentrations over a long period of time, and there's a\nreason for that.\nAs Dr. Brody explains on page 87 of the joint\nappendix, the lungs can naturally rid themselves of the\nfibers at the low concentrations. It's only at the high\nconcentrations -- the macrophages. It's only at the high\nconcentrations that the lungs can't rid themselves of the\nfibers.\nWhile we have no idea how low the concentration\nlevels were at these other workplaces, we do know how high\nthe concentrations levels were at petitioner's workplace,\nbecause Mr. Butler testified on page 249 of the joint\nappendix that during those three months, he worked in the\nlocation of petitioner's workplace where the asbestos\nconcentrations were at the highest. Mr. Butler testified\nthat he worked in the room where the engines were stripped\nof their fibers, and more fibers were placed on.\nHe testifies on page 249 he looks at these same\npictures, which were trial exhibits -- they're reproduced\nin our brief. He looks at these pictures and he says,\nyes, that's the kind of room I worked in. This is 249\nand 250.\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. LAZARUS: So we know he had the very high\nconcentrations --\nQUESTION: Well now, how do we know that?\nYou're saying he worked in the place with the highest\nconcentrations so far as the railroad is concerned, but\nhow do we know how that compares with where he worked\nelsewhere?\nMR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, we have no idea, and\nthey -- because they never introduced or sought to\nintroduce any evidence, but what we do know is that very\nlow concentrations -- here we can turn to the Rand report,\nwhich they filed with this Court -- lodged with the\nCourt --just two weeks ago. The Rand report and the\ntestimony of this case makes absolutely clear that in low\nconcentration employment centers, at low concentration\nexposures, one is very unlikely to have any kind of\nphysical injury, asbestosis or cancer ever develop, which\nis why there are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of\nplaintiffs, many of which come from low exposure, which,\nas the Rand report makes clear, is not likely to lead to\nany kind of disease. We have no idea how low it was here.\nWe know how high it was here.\nI have no doubt, Your Honor, that petitioner\nwould have been very hard-pressed at trial to actually\nshow what the doses were, and to show what the dose\nrelationship is, but what I do know is, whatever their\nreason was at trial for never trying to introduce this\nevidence, and they never -- if you looked at their motion,\nwhere they made the motion for this jury instruction, they\nnever even remotely suggest what the basis for\napportionment would be, but whatever their strategic\nreason for doing that at trial, what is absolutely clear\nis they are not allowed in the first instance to come to\nthe United States Supreme Court and proffer newspaper\narticles, magazine articles, selected journal articles and\ntry to argue that there is a reasonable basis for\napportionment, or they're entitled to a remand to litigate\na issue which they failed to litigate in the first\ninstance.\nThe simple truth, Your Honor, is that at trial\nin this case the respondents established all of their\nessential elements of their negligent cause of action.\nThey established their physical injury, and they received\na jury award which certainly, compared to the jury awards\nthat I see mentioned in the amicus briefs, is a jury award\nwhich seems relatively modest, and certainly a jury award\nwhich on its face doesn't suggest that there was some\noutrageous amount given for reasonable fear of cancer.\nQUESTION:\nno evidence of what the degree of exposure in other areas,\nand so forth and so on. Didn't they make any offers of\nproof with, or did they just the prove the time that they\nworked --\nMR. LAZARUS: They really just proved the time.\nThey -- we know the nature of the work, but what we don't\nknow, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Well, but then that would be a\nquestion of the weight of that evidence, rather than\nwhether they preserved the point.\nMR. LAZARUS: Well, Your Honor, I'm not -- they\nnever offer a basis of apportionment. We'd have to know,\nand the evidence at trial made clear, to know the dose and\ndose relationship you'd have to know the air flow rates,\nthe pathways of exposure --\nQUESTION: At what point in the trial did it\nbecome clear, by a ruling of the trial judge, that they\ncould not rely on the exposure in other areas?\nMR. LAZARUS: Your Honor, they were not denied\nthis opportunity at trial to introduce the evidence with\nrespect to the non-railroad employment, and you can see\nthat because they actually did do some cross-examination,\nthey did try to introduce the evidence of three months,\nthey did try to refer to the other workplaces, they could\nhave tried to introduce more evidence.\nQUESTION: Well, why was that relevant if\nthere's joint liability?\nMR. LAZARUS: Well, we thought it was\nirrelevant, Your Honor, but they were clearly thinking\nabout the possibility of requesting an apportionment\ninstruction, but the fact is, they never laid out a\nreasonable basis.\nIf you look at the memorandum --\nQUESTION: Oh, but they did request an\ninstruction, didn't they?\nMR. LAZARUS: They did request the instruction,\nbut --\nQUESTION: So the point was preserved.\nMR. LAZARUS: Right, but the trial court was\ncorrect in denying the instruction because they had not\nmet their burden of proffering a reasonable basis for\napportionment, and in the absence of that evidentiary\nbasis, the trial court was absolutely correct in denying\nit. This was a jury verdict, Your Honor, this was\nreached.\nQUESTION: Oh, but that theory, then, is that\nseveral liability would have been appropriate if the\nevidence were sufficient?\nMR. LAZARUS: Well, no, Your Honor. Our\nthreshold argument is that it would not -- asbestosis,\nthis is a classic individual injury. There are many\ncourts who have talked about this, and they said, well, in\ntheory, asbestosis is dose-related.\nQUESTION: With respect, Mr. Lazarus, isn't\nyour -- the bottom line in this argument that this is\nsimply not an issue in the case, because they didn't\nprovide a basis?\nMR. LAZARUS: Yes, that's absolutely right.\nQUESTION: So you're saying, forget it.\nMR. LAZARUS: That's right. They had the burden\nand they simply didn't meet their burden.\nQUESTION: And they say you had the burden.\nMR. LAZARUS: Well, but it's quite --\nQUESTION: It seems to me that argument goes to\nthe weight of the evidence they offered, rather than to\nthe -- your legal position. I may be missing something.\nMR. LAZARUS: Well, Your Honor, no, they have to\nas a matter of law, right, proffer some kind, and here\nthere's absolutely nothing --\nQUESTION: Well, but they did proffer -- if I\nremember it, they did proffer evidence as to the time that\nthese people worked in other areas where they were exposed\nto asbestos, didn't they?\nMR. LAZARUS: There is some evidence --\nQUESTION:\nMR. LAZARUS: There's some evidence as to that,\nbut in fact if you can look to their instruction they\ndon't even say what -- that time is the relevant factor,\nand I think the evidence at trial shows that time is not\neven close to establishing what the dose relationship\nwould be. This is very complicated.\nQUESTION: But aren't you really saying that\nunless there's an abuse of discretion on the part of the\ntrial judge in refusing to send this to the jury, based on\nwhat you've just described, insufficiency of evidence on\ntheir part, that it's not in the case for us?\nMR. LAZARUS: That's absolutely right, Your\nHonor.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Lazarus.\nMr. Phillips, you have two minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI want to be absolutely clear about the\napportionment in this case. We put in an instruction on\napportionment based on a reasonable basis following\nJustice Kennedy's analysis of the law, which says if\nthere's a reasonable basis to apportion, you do that.\nThe trial judge did not reject that on the basis\nof insufficient evidence. What he said at page 179,\nvolume 9 of the transcript is, if you've got a joint tort\nfeasor, that tort-feasor is liable for all of the\ninjuries. He said it as a matter of law. It's joint and\nseveral liability. There is no apportionment. That's the\nruling we challenged. That's the legal issue before this\nCourt.\nThe second question, then, with your leave, is\nto --\nQUESTION: Well, but should we adopt your\nposition if it's as difficult to show this separate\ncausation as your brother argues?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, Dean Prosser said from day\none it's always going to be difficult to apportion, but\nthat's no reason not to have the jury undertake to\napportion. There are lots of decisions that juries make\nthat are very hard to make, but the better rule is to\napportion, because that's the fair outcome that will arise\nin these cases.\nWith respect to the fear of cancer damages, the\nkey to this case, it seems to me, is just how big a\ngatekeeper function the fact of asbestosis can be, and\nmy -- the argument is, asbestosis is extraordinarily easy\nto diagnose. There are currently 5,500 cases under FELA\nin West Virginia.\nclaim of asbestosis. Every single one of them will be\nsupported by an expert.\nWhat you get is, that's not a gatekeeper. Those\ncases are going to come in, and then you're going to have\nexactly the kinds of evidence you had in this case, I'm\nafraid of cancer, give me whatever you think is the right\nnumber. That is the essence of unpredictable and\nunlimited damages. This Court declined to allow that\nunder FELA in Buckley. It should decline to allow that\nunder FELA in this case as well.\nIf there are no questions, I'll reserve --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,\n"
