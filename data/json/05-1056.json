        "content": "[10:14 a.m.]\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument now in\nNo. 05-1056, Microsoft against AT&T.\nMr. Olson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Justice Stevens. May\nit please the Court:\nThe limited monopoly granted by U.S. patent\nlaws protects against the making, using or selling a\npatented invention within the United States. Section\n271(f) also makes it an infringement to make components\nof a patented invention within the United States and\nthen simply ship them abroad for reassembly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Olson, before you get\ninto the merits I have a question, a preliminary\nquestion. I understand from AT&T's brief that there has\nbeen a stipulation entered into between the parties\nafter the judgment below which preserved Microsoft's\nright to appeal and prescribed different dollar amounts\nthat Microsoft must pay AT&T depending on the outcome of\nthe appeal. Does that raise any, any muteness problem?\nCan you sort of wager on the outcome of an appeal that\nway?\nMR. OLSON: No, I don't believe so, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, suppose two parties\njust, you know, parties that otherwise do not have a\ncase or controversy, bet each other that the district\ncourt will come out one way or the other way in, in a\ntrumped-up suit. Does that create a standing --\nMR. OLSON: This is by no means a trumped-up\nsuit. It's a very serious suit. The outcome, the\njudgment, the amount of damages that must be paid is not\na matter of wager. It depends upon the decision of a\nmatter of law of an interpretation of a statute of the\nUnited States.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you could say the\nsame thing in the hypothetical I gave. It is a matter\nof wager, which way the Court will come out.\nMR. OLSON: This is an entirely legitimate,\nI submit, means by which parties may preserve a legal\nissue depending upon how a legal question is decided.\nThe only thing that's been resolved is the amount that\nwill be paid as damages depending upon the outcome of\nthe appeal.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know of any, any\nprecedent for that?\nMR. OLSON: It seems to me, Justice Scalia,\nthat it happens frequently, especially in criminal cases\nwhere there is -- someone pleads guilty in and\npreserving a right to appeal a certain issue. I don't\nhave a case to cite to you but it strikes me as quite\nunderstandable that the parties might agree if the\noutcome of the legal question that the judge might\ndecide is going to be X, then the consequence will be a\nliability for Y. If it's -- if it's of the opposite\noutcome, the outcome will be different. That's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the amount were\ntrivial and you just wanted to get a resolution of this\nquestion?\nMR. OLSON: Well, I think that if the\namount --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then there would be a case\nwith a controversy problem, I should think.\nMR. OLSON: I don't know what the Court\nmight mean by the word trivial, Justice Kennedy, but\nthis is a very significant major amount involved in this\ncase. There is no question that the parties are very\nserious. It's a very significant legal question with\nrespect to the interpretation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's so, but is there a\nlot of money involved depending on whether you win or\nlose?\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. OLSON: In this case, notwithstanding\nthe limitation of in Section 271(f) that the components,\nthere's -- liability of the components are created here,\nand reassemble the broad. The Federal Circuit held that\nforeign made tangible reproductions of computer\noperating code installed in foreign-made computers may\nbe components which are deemed or essentially supplied\nfrom the United States, because copying is part and\nparcel of software distribution, and thus subsumed in\nthe act of supplying. Under this ruling, U.S. companies\nmay be held liable for patent infringement whenever\ntheir products are copied or replicated abroad. This --\nthe court of appeals decision and the position of\nRespondents requires reworking several words in the\nstatute.\nThe statute says supplied from the United\nStates. The court of appeals said, well, it might be\ndeemed supplied from the United States after it's copied\nabroad. The Respondent takes the words \"such\ncomponents\" in the statute and reads them as not the\nsame components.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Olson, isn't one of\nthe questions whether the software is really being\ncopied when it's transferred from the golden disk to the\nnew manufacturer, or whether it's actually being\nsupplied?\nMR. OLSON: It is being copied. There isn't\nany question that it's being copied, Justice Stevens.\nThe stipulation which is in pages 44-A through 47-A of\nthe petition appendix contains the words -- this is\nwords to which respondent stipulated -- foreign-made\ncopies replicated object code, foreign manufactured\ncopies, foreign replicated object code. What happens,\nJustice Stevens, is that the golden master of the disk\nwhich contains the physical manifestation of the object\ncode is read by a machine somewhere outside the United\nStates, looked at and then copied onto another physical\nmedium, either a hard drive or a disk. Many hard\ndrives, many disks. Those foreign replicated physical\ntangible copies are then installed in computers and they\nbecome components of those computers.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the master disk a\ncomponent?\nMR. OLSON: The master -- well, AT&T has\ntaken two positions on that. We --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your position?\nMR. OLSON: Our position is that it's not a\ncomponent of the final product computers that are made\nabroad. What is a component is a replication, a copy of\na new hard drive or a new disk that's made a part of\nthose computers which, without which --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just the disk but not the\ninformation on the disk is the component.\nMR. OLSON: The information on the disk is\nof no use to the computer unless it's made into a\nphysical machine readable document -- object.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That -- Mr. Olson, that\nis the position of AT&T as I understand it, that what\nyou call the object code appears in the -- in the\ncomputer that it's -- that is what is sent, along with\nthe master disk, and the object code is the critical\ncomponent, according to AT&T. In fact, wasn't that the\nfirst question that you raised, whether digital software\ncode, an intangible sequence of 1's and 0's may be\nconsidered a component of a patent, patented invention?\nMR. OLSON: If I understand your question,\nJustice Ginsburg, let me answer it this way. AT&T has\ntaken two positions. The most recent position is that\nit's the intangible object code, the series of 1's and\n0's, or instructions to a computer switch to be on or\noff, that is a component. They also took a position\nearlier in the case and which is referred to in the\nstipulation that it was the golden master, the physical\nmanifestation on the -- on a master disk that went\nabroad that was the component.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I still would like to\nknow your position. The golden disk is or is not a\ncomponent?\nMR. OLSON: It is not a component --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But copies of the golden\ndisk are or are not components?\nMR. OLSON: The copies, the physical\nmanifestation on a hard drive --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Physical manifestation?\nMR. OLSON: Our components of the foreign\nmanufactured computers. Those components are not\nsupplied from --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose if you could, if\nyou made 99 copies, those would be 99 components. Then\nif you used -- if you're going to make 100 machines. If\nyou used for your disk the master disk for the last\ncopy, then that would have been -- that would -- then\nthe master disk would be a copy, a component of the last\nmachine.\nMR. OLSON: If -- well, I think, if I\nunderstand your question, if you make -- and it depends\nupon where you make it, where you transfer --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You make them abroad.\nMR. OLSON: If you make it abroad, that --\nand it's -- that is where the component is supplied\nfrom. Copies are made abroad. There's no question\nabout that and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if the disk, if the\ngolden disk itself after they finish the copies, were\nused --\nMR. OLSON: If the physical --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in a hardware, then\nthat would be a component.\nMR. OLSON: If that physical golden disk\nwere actually put into a computer and used without more.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I'm a little\nconfused, because I thought the golden disk was just one\nmethod of getting the software into the new computers.\nAnd I thought it was the software which was arguably the\ncomponent, not any physical manifestation.\nMR. OLSON: Well, that's why I said AT&T has\ntaken two positions. Here's the position that they took\nin their brief before the court of appeals. Three\ndecades of patent jurisprudence have authoritatively\nrecognized software to be a physical and structural\ncomponent of patented machines. The problem, Justice\nStevens --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But do you -- what is your\nview on whether or not software is a component?\nMR. OLSON: The -- if I may answer that by\nsaying that people use the word \"software\" in two\ndifferent ways. One of which, they use it as the\nintangible series of 1's and 0's. We submit that the\ncorrect way to understand the word \"software\" is the\nphysical manifestation of that what is called source\ncode, which is made into object code, which is made into\nmachine readable code.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or at least the correct way\nto understand component.\nMR. OLSON: It is the correct way to\nunderstand the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the component then\nwould be either a disk which is put into a computer or\nthe portion of the hard drive to which the code is\ntransferred.\nMR. OLSON: Yes. As I understand it,\nJustice Souter, and I think the stipulations make this\nclear, there's a reference in the stipulations to\nencoded transmissions but there's a -- but the parties\nalso agree that's the same process as the golden disk.\nThe golden disk is sent abroad. That is read by a\nmachine and then the machine understands -- it's almost\nas if you were to read physically any other type of\ndocument, read it to a machine. The machine understands\nwhat is said, puts it into a physical manifestation on a\ndisk or on a hard drive. Many copies are made in that\nfashion. They are installed in computers made abroad,\nsold to foreign purchasers.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So are you saying that\nneither the source code nor the compilation are a\ncomponent?\nMR. OLSON: Of the foreign? The language of\nthe statute is the foreign manufactured product. Those\nare the computers that are sold abroad. It is our\nposition that the only components that are in issue in\nthis case are the physical manifestations of the object\ncode on a hard drive or on a disk.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So that neither the source\ncode nor the compilation are a component, save as, the\ncompilation is put on a disk?\nMR. OLSON: That's correct. And the -- the\nthing that's on the disk in the foreign --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That seems odd. I mean,\nMicrosoft doesn't say please buy our disk because it's\nthe prettiest disk in the business.\nMR. OLSON: Justice Kennedy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It says buy our program\nbecause the program means something.\nMR. OLSON: But the program is nothing until\nmade into a physical manifestation that can be made by\nthe computer.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What is patented? Is the\nphysical object patented or is the software patented?\nMR. OLSON: The AT&T patent --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. OLSON: The '580 patent is a program, as\nI understand it, that's married to a computer, has to be\nmarried to a computer in order to be patented.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can't patent, you know,\non-off, on-off code in the abstract, can you?\nMR. OLSON: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There needs to be a device.\nMR. OLSON: An idea or a principle, two plus\ntwo equals four can't be patented. It has to be put\ntogether with a machine and made into a usable device.\nThe bind that AT&T is in here is that the components\nthat make the machines run that are produced abroad are\nnot supplied from the United States. They are made in\nBelgium or Frankfurt or something.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That depends on what you\nconsider the component. They define component as\nincluding the, what you've been calling the abstract.\nMR. OLSON: They have attempted, Justice\nGinsburg, with respect, to have it both ways. They've\nsaid that it is a physical and structural thing,\nsomething that's on the golden master disk. And then\nthey say it's just the binary code in the abstract, but\nthat in the abstract never becomes a part of the\ncomputer.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What did the Federal\nCircuit say? And I read the opinion a couple of times\nand it was, it seemed to me ambiguous whether the\nFederal Circuit was identifying the component as the\nobject code itself or the master disk.\nMR. OLSON: Yes. I agree with you. The\nFederal Circuit was ambiguous, in part because there\nwere two separate decisions. The court considered the\ncomponent issue in the Eolas case and then when this\ncase came along, said we've already decided the\ncomponent portion of the statute; now we must decide the\nsupplied from. So the language which the Federal\nCircuit used is a bit confusing. Basically what it\nsaid, though, is that the act of supplying embraces the\nact of copying. That means that any, any company\nsending a machine or a patented product abroad, that\nthat machine must be copied in order to be mass produced\nabroad. It might be a pill. It might be a mousetrap.\nIt might be a Buick. That exact identical copy if\nreplicated abroad does not violate the statutes, the\npatent laws, it doesn't constitute an infringement.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you had a patent\non a biological organism and it was contained in a\nlittle vial, and you shipped it abroad. Just by doing\nnothing at all, it grew, and it had -- it grew into 100\ndifferent parts.\nMR. OLSON: If it reproduces itself, Justice\nKennedy, somewhere outside the United States --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.\nMR. OLSON: What you're suggesting is that\nthere is a pattern or a recipe or a template or a mold.\nIt could be the same thing. If it's reproduced outside\nthe United States by some laboratory outside the United\nStates, then the components are not being sent from the\nUnited States for reassembly abroad.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't this an artificial\ndistinction in -- when you're talking about the making\nof a tangible part, there's at least some cost involved\nin doing it here or doing it abroad, and some time\ninvolved. But with, with software, the Federal\nCircuit's point was that it is so easy and inexpensive\nand fast to copy it that simply sending the information\nabroad, sending the object code abroad in the form of\nthe golden disk, is tantamount to manufacturing copies\noverseas.\nMR. OLSON: I think there are three answers\nto that. Surely the patent laws cannot be determined\naccording to whether it's easy or fast or efficient to\nreplicate something. There has to be a line that makes\nsome sense. Number two, it may be fast and efficient\nbut there are certainly costs involved in taking the\nmachines to do it. Number three, where would that take\nus? A design -- every product contains its own\nmanifestation of its design. That would take us\neverywhere, because any product can be copied abroad.\nHowever -- and maybe there are going to be fast ways to\nproduce other things. These are replicas,\nreproductions, copies. These are not such components\nthat are supplied from the United States. If I may\nreserve the balance of my time? Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Joseffer.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. JOSEFFER: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIt might help if I could start by putting\nthis case into its context in both the United States and\ninternational patent law. Section 271(f) is a limited\nextension of normal territoriality principles that is\ndesigned to shore up the prohibition against actually\nmaking a patented invention in the United States, but it\ndoes not take the further and extraordinary step of\napplying United States law to the conduct of copying\nparts abroad for assembly and sale abroad conduct is\nproperly the subject of foreign law.\nAs a result, in the context of traditional\nmanufacturing, for example, it has always been\nunderstood pursuant to the statute's text, that while\ncompanies cannot make parts in the United States for\nfinal assembly abroad -- that's too close to making it\nhere -- they may make copies in a foreign country by,\nfor example, sending the design to the foreign country\nor sending a specific part to the foreign country that\ncan be copied there.\nThat distinction between copying in the\nUnited States and copying in the foreign country has two\ncritical dimensions. The first is that it protects the\nforeign government's sovereign prerogative to establish\nthe rules of competition that will govern companies that\nwish to compete in that foreign country's markets by\ncopying their products abroad, assembling them there and\nselling them there.\nThe second, which is the flip side of\nthat point, is that it enables United States companies\nto compete on an even playing field abroad against their\nforeign competitors by manufacturing, assembling, and\nselling parts abroad, subject --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Joseffer, to the, to\nthe extent that you are claiming that there are foreign\nnations that would have an interest in this, usually\nwhen that is so, hear from them and in this case there\nis a strange silence in that regard.\nMR. JOSEFFER: I think that -- I can say --\na couple points I can make. One is, this case has, has\nbeen viewed because of the Federal Circuit's attempt to\ntie this to software on the grounds that software can\neasily be copied abroad, I think this case has been\nsomewhat narrowly viewed as a software case. But in\ntruth, there's no basis for distinguishing software from\nanything else, and if the Federal Circuit's decision was\nactually taken to its logical conclusion I have no doubt\nthat other nations would be quite concerned, like in --\nin two ways.\nOne is we have looked, not exhaustively but\nwe have looked, and we have not been able to find a\nsingle other country that would apply its law in the\ncircumstances if they were reversed. In other words if\na German condition wanted to compete in the United\nStates subject to German law by making copies here,\nassembling them here, selling them here, Germany would\nstay out of that because it's the United States'\nprerogative. Also there are significant differences\nbetween the nations' patent laws. For software in\nparticular, the United States is much more bullish on\nthe patentability of software-related inventions than\nmany other countries. But even for more mundane\nreasons, if we were talking about anything -- it could\nbe that the foreign government doesn't think that an\ninvention is particularly novel, it just disagrees with\nus about that, or it doesn't think there is sufficient\nadvance in the prior art sufficiently inventive to\nwarrant patent protection. And if the foreign country\nis going to make that determination regarding\ncompetition policy in its own borders, it's entitled to\nmake that determination.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let me ask you about a\ndomestic law question. One side is telling us it's the\ncomponent that's supplied, whether it's the master disk\nor the object code. And the other side says this is\njust like a blueprint, like a mold, like a template.\nCan a blueprint be patented? Can a mold be patented?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Not ordinarily. I mean --\nI'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Copyright. Copyright. You\nnormally copyright.\nMR. JOSEFFER: You can certainly copyright\nsomething like that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yeah, but patent --\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well the -- no, but the -- I\nthink the most important point here is that the\ncomponents of patented inventions do not have to be\npatentable. Many patented inventions are comprised of a\nbunch of parts where the parts themselves would not be\npatentable because say they were standard off the shelf\nparts.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there can be a\nprocess patent.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes, and we don't -- I mean,\nprocess patents, a process patent is a series of steps\nor acts for performing a certain function, such as\nturning rubber into a tire. We don't think process\npatents are relevant -- are, are covered by this statute\nfor a couple of reasons. And it's not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What, what is your view of\nwhat the component is in this case.\nMR. JOSEFFER: The component is the, is the\nactual machine readable copy of software that is\ninserted in --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The software is the\ncomponent?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, but the, the -- but\nlike with anything, you could say a computer is also the\ncomponent, but it's the actual computer, not you know,\nany copy of the same computer.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But in this case, you're --\nbut Mr. Olson said the component is either the disk or\nthe portion of the hard drive to which the, the coded\ninstructions are transferred.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you accept that?\nMR. JOSEFFER: The United States view -- I'm\nnot sure exactly how much we disagree on this -- but the\nUnited States view is that, for example, a blank disk is\nnot a component of this invention because you don't need\na blank disk to practice this invention. The -- the\nactual component is the physical substantiation, the\nphysical copy of the software that's inserted into a\ncomputer and if you get a disk --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, the disk\nplus the -- plus the coded instructions.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Yes. And again the coded --\nthe software could be on a disk or it could be on some\nother technology. It doesn't matter how it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It could be on the hard\ndrive.\nMR. JOSEFFER: And once it's copied on to\nthe hard drive, then the copy on the hard drive is\nitself a component.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I take it that we are\noperating under the assumption that software is\npatentable? We have never held that in this Court, have\nwe?\nMR. JOSEFFER: No, but as I was saying\nbefore --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what should we do here?\nShould, if we are writing this, since it's never been\nheld that it's patentable in this Court --\nMR. JOSEFFER: I think if --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If I were writing\nsomething, should I say on the assumption that it's\npatentable? Since the issue isn't raised?\nMR. JOSEFFER: No. I think, I think the\nreason that's not relevant here is that the patented\ninvention in this case is not software. It's computer\nthat has software loaded into it. And the components of\na patented invention do not themselves have to be\npatented.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can have you have a\ncopyright on a program?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Ah, if you wrote it out, yes.\nIf I wrote out a string of 1's and 0's I could copyright\nthe strings of 1's and 0's that was -- that was written\nout on a piece of paper. But the -- in terms of what\nthe component is here, the other things --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you, the point I\ndon't understand when you say the -- the component is\nthe disk that contains material, I understand that\nbecause here is a separate piece; it's a disk. You plug\nit in; it has the information on it. But then you say,\nif you put it on the hard drive it becomes the\ncomponent. But the hard drive is not a separate thing\nlike a disk. And when you say you put it on the hard\ndrive you have nothing there but -- but -- but ons and\noffs. You have nothing there but the -- but the\nthought.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How can you call, you know,\nwhat? Is it a separate section of the hard drive? No.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, you could go later in\nand delete that software off the hard drive which\nconfirms that the software does have a separate physical\nexistence in there. But the main point is that the --\nthe component is the, is the physical substantiation of\nthe software. The actual copy of the software. It\ndoesn't matter if it's on a hard disk; doesn't mean it's\non a disk; it doesn't matter if it's in the air in\nwireless transmission. It's just the physical copy of\nthe software. And you could have a situation where\nthere are multiple copies of that same component in a\ncomputer. One --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If these -- if these\ncomputers are built abroad and are sold with Windows\ninstalled, the component is the electrons on the hard\ndrive? Is that what, that's your position?\nMR. JOSEFFER: It's the physical embodiment\nof the software which in some instances is manifested by\n-- by those electrons. Now AT&T's contrary view is that\nthe abstract code in the abstract is the component. The\nreason that can't be is that object code in the abstract\nis just a series of 1's and 0's. In theory I could\nmemorize in my head or write down on a piece of paper.\nBut that's not going to combine with other, with other\nparts to make a patented invention.\nAnd if I could illustrate that with a simple\nlock and key example, a key has a series of ridges on it\nthat enable it to open a lock. And that series of\nridges can be denoted by a sequence of numbers, bigger\nnumbers for deeper ridges. But the component is the key\nthat actually turns the lock, not the abstract sequence\nof ridges on the key. And you can then say that about\nanything; you can always say that any physical product,\nany physical part, is a physical manifestation of its\nabstract design.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that analogous to the\nsource and the compilation, the source being the design,\nthe compilation being the key?\nMR. JOSEFFER: No. The source code and\nobject code are just different computer languages for\nexpressing the same thing. There is no -- there's no\ndifference between them. One is words and one is\nnumbers, but they mean the same thing. There is no\nreason to treat them differently.\nThe point is just that if you treat the --\neither the source code or the object code as the\ncomponent, that's just the design of the actual physical\nsoftware that goes into the computer. If you did that\nyou'd have a vastly different statute because any\nphysical part has a design, but the whole point of the\nstatute is to prohibit copying of parts in the United\nStates while permitting copying of parts abroad for sale\nabroad.\nBut if the design itself was a component\nthen you could never copy parts abroad when something\nwas designed in the United States, because something\ndesigned abroad would always infringe because the\nsomething designed abroad would itself be the component,\nand that would be a vastly different statute there's no\nreason to think Congress intended here, especially\nbecause of the extraterritorial consequences.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Windows wasn't around\nwhen this statute was passed.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, the statute was enacted\nin 1984 when software was certainly present. It's fair\nto say that Congress was not thinking of software, but\nthat's further caution for not expanding the statute\nbeyond traditional territorial reaches. Because first,\nthis Court has cautioned, has said that it should be\ncautious in applying existing electrical property\nstatutes to new technologies. And in addition it's\nemphasized in Deepsouth that the caution against\nextraterritoriality applies in this very context. So\nCongress is writing against the backdrop of normal\nterritorial principles, which are the making, using or\nselling inventions of foreign countries subject only to\nforeign law, and against the backdrop of Deepsouth,\nwhich has specifically held that Congress has to speak\nclearly to enact of statute like this.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought it was the\nposition of the Federal Circuit that Deepsouth has to be\nbrought into an electronic era, and so the -- the\nFederal Circuit was taking a statute that had a shrimp\ndeveiner in mind and saying well, this is how that\nnotion should apply to an electronic world.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. And the reason that\ndoesn't work in the statutory text and policies is that\nthe component that we are talking about here is the\nspecific part that goes in the machine. And if -- and\nif -- and under the statute you have to let the company\nsend the design abroad to manufacture it abroad, both to\nprotect the company's ability to compete abroad and to\nprotect the foreign government's prerogatives.\nOtherwise it's just a vastly different statute than the\none that Congress enacted. That's really our terms of\nthe politics.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Your time is up, but I\nwant to ask you one yes or no question. In your view is\nsoftware patentable?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Standing alone in and of\nitself, no.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.\nMr. Waxman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN,\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court.\nThere is no question that Microsoft supplies\nthe Windows object code, that is the precise, machine\nreadable sequence of commands that instructs a\ncomputer's processor. From the United States, that is\nparagraph 7 of the stipulation.\nThere is likewise no question that it does\nso with the intent that precisely the same sequence,\nwhich runs to millions of lines of binary digits, will\nbe installed and stored -- those are Microsoft's\nwords -- in foreign computers precisely so that they may\npractice AT&T's invention.\nThose facts resolve this case because it is\nthus entirely consistent with the ordinary meaning of\nthe words of the statute to say that Microsoft has\nquote, \"supplied\" a quote, \"component\" that when quote,\n\"combined with hardware\" enables the practice of AT&T's\ninvention. Now let's look at --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose I send someone to\nthe Patent Office --\nMR. WAXMAN: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose I send someone to\nthe Patent Office, goes there, picks up the patent, and\nthis patent is written very, very, very concretely and\nspecifically. Gets on the phone, phones somebody in\nGermany and reads it to him. And that person, having an\nexcellent memory, takes everything in and now he has the\nprecise instruction necessary to change the machine\naround or put various things into it. So now it is a\nprecise copy of the machine in the United States.\nMR. WAXMAN: That's not the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that -- how is that\ndifferent from this? How is it different?\nMR. WAXMAN: That is very different than\nthis case because what -- first of all, we all agree\nthat software code in and of itself, removed from a\nphysical structure, cannot be patentable and when\nsoftware -- when some -- when an invention that is\npracticed with software is patented, at the most what\nyou will see is preferred embodiments of the source code\nwhich is language that humans understand and which\ncomputers do not.\nA lot of work has to be done in items of\ndebugging and testing and compiling to create what is,\nby stipulation, at issue in this case, which is the\nprecise, machine readable sequence that commands a\ncomputer's CPU millions of times a second. Source code\nwould do nothing. Source code has to be worked on\noverseas.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. We have a genius\n-- we have, as they used to have to get all the stuff\nthat we stole from England, with the -- with the --\nremember the weaving machines and the cotton spinners\nand so forth? This genius comes over here; he looks at\na really complex machine; it is now stored in his head,\nthe precise details that nobody else could do. He runs\nback to Germany, and he builds it. Well, he has\nabsolutely stolen the precise, incredibly complex\ndetails of this machine.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, does it matter, if\ninstead of sending the individual, we send the machine\nto Germany. This genius looks at it in Germany and\nthere he makes the copy. Are they any different?\nMR. WAXMAN: When you're talking -- when\nyou're talking about sending designs over or blueprints\nor management instructions or a high level version of,\ngee let's have a code that will perform the following\nfunctions, and you have people design and make and\ncompile and test and debug that code overseas, of course\nthat component, the component is the object code, the\nprecise commands that reside in the computer and\ncontinually interact with the hardware of the computer\nin a way I'm going to describe and is not disputed,\nmillions of times a second.\nLet's take this case. Okay. Is it -- the\nquestion is, is it a component and whether what was\nsupplied was in fact combined. That's, that's -- that's\nwhat this case boils down to. As to the component.\nWe have something, software program, the\nNetMeeting and sound recorded program that can in its\nobject, its machine readable command form, is developed,\nbought and sold entirely separately from any hardware\nthat it commands.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that is what is on\nmaster disk.\nMR. WAXMAN: And that is what is either on\nthe master disk or, although either side obscures this,\nthat is what is represented in the electric --\nelectronic transmission, that is another means by which\nthe code is supplied.\nAnd in paragraph 7 of the stipulation\nMicrosoft acknowledges that it supplies the Windows\nobject code by transmitting it to manufacturers\noverseas. And the way that happens is the code, the\nmachine language, is resident in Redmond, either in the\npits and lands of a CD or on the varying magnetic\norientations of a hard drive, and a, some engineer from\nMicrosoft presses a button and it is essentially, it is\ntaken and converted into photons which stream whatever\nit is, 7,000 miles, under the land and under the\nAtlantic Ocean and emerges into a machine, a computer, a\nbit of otherwise inanimate parts that are sitting there\nin Dusseldorf, where it is loaded onto the hard drive,\nit's converted from photons to a series of electrical\npulses.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that really what\nhappens? As I understand it there is an intermediate\nstep. They don't send it directly from the United\nStates to each of the individual computers in Germany.\nThey send it to a central point which then redistributes\nit. Is that not right.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I think that paragraph 7\nof the stipulation, it doesn't specify one way or the\nother, but their case, Justice Stevens, depends upon the\nfollowing. Because if I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If you're correct that\nthey're just sending from New York direct to the 500\ndifferent machines all on one transmission from New\nYork, there's no lawsuit here.\nMR. WAXMAN: Let me give you two examples --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that what you're trying\nto tell us, that they do send it directly from New York\nto 500 different recipients in Germany?\nMR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. And it wouldn't --\nwhat I'm saying is there is at least one violation of\n271(f) here. 271(f) looks exclusively at what is done\nin the United States. It is entirely irrelevant to\n271(f) what, if anything, is done overseas. The Federal\nCircuit has made this clear in the Waymark case and it's\nconsistent with the language.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would it be a violation if\nthey sent, if they sent the golden disk abroad and\nnobody ever copied anything off the golden disk?\nMR. WAXMAN: If they sent the golden disk\nabroad or if the Microsoft engineer --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you answer my\nquestion?\nMR. WAXMAN: I think I am. The answer is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If they send the golden\ndisk abroad and never use it, would that be a violation?\nMR. WAXMAN: If they had the necessary\nintent and purpose. They had to have had the specific\nintent and purpose that it be combined in order to\ncreate a device that wouldn't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Suppose it is never, it is\nnever combined?\nMR. WAXMAN: It wouldn't matter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you -- and the reason it\nwouldn't matter on your view is that the component is\nthe object code on the disk, not the disk itself?\nMR. WAXMAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Then why\ndoesn't that get you --\nMR. WAXMAN: It could be --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why doesn't that get you\nright back to the point that Justice Breyer was making?\nYou are saying, I think, in essence if you send a\nblueprint -- this is like a blueprint. It tells, it\ntells a machine which may be in Europe how to put the\nobject code on other disks or on hard drives. The\nmachine in Europe is following instructions just the way\nan artisan would follow a blueprint.\nMR. WAXMAN: Here's the difference.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What is the difference?\nMR. WAXMAN: And it's nicely embodied in\nMicrosoft's reply's use, repeated use of the word\n\"antecedent.\" A blueprint or a design is a precursor to\nthe actual device. It is the instructions about how to\nmake something. It's not the thing itself. And here\nwhat we have is the object code that is the precise\ncommands that, unlike design information, interact\ncontinuously with the hard drive and with the processor\nin order to make physical changes on an ongoing basis.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the \"continuously\"\ndoes not describe the process of going from the master\ndisk to what you claim to be the infringing computer\nsold in Europe. There is no continuous process there.\nAs I understand it, what happens is -- let's just take\nthe master disk and forget the photon for the moment.\nThe master disk functions like a blueprint. They send,\nfrom the United States they send the blueprint to\nEurope. The blueprint is put in some kind of a machine\nin Europe. And by the use of the blueprint the machine\nputs electrical charges on a disk or on a hard drive,\nand that it seems to me does bear out the blueprint\nanalogy. And if it does, then any export of a blueprint\nor indeed the simple export, the simple sending of the\n'820, if that's the right number, patent in this case\nwould be a violation.\nMR. WAXMAN: I have to disagree, Justice\nSouter, because the blueprint -- the patent is not the\nactual series of commands that runs the machine and\nneither is the blueprint. The blueprint is\ninstructions, to be sure, and it can be reflected in\nintangible code, but it's instructions about how to make\nsomething and once it's made it's done. You can say, as\nMr. Olson did, that the design is embodied in the thing\nthat is made. The blueprint for a semiconductor chip in\nsome sense is always reflected in that chip. But if you\ndon't like the chip you have to get rid of it. Software\ncan be -- if you don't like Microsoft Word, you can\ndownload it and you can delete it and download\nWordPerfect and use that. And what happens in the\ncomputer -- and I think this does bear on what the\nnature of the component is and why in the ordinary sense\nof the word \"component\" and the ordinary sense of the\nwords \"supply\" and \"combine,\" they apply naturally to\nwhat Microsoft does.\nI mean, is a disk, is a typewriter, is a\nscreen, is a hard drive, is a CPU a component? Are they\ncomponents when they have the code embedded in it? Of\ncourse. But that doesn't -- a tire doesn't become not a\ncomponent of a car just because a tire with a wheel\nattached to it is also a component. The question is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose, suppose you\nhad a machine that makes another machine, and if you\nship that machine to Europe -- and there's a patent for\nthe machine that makes it. If you ship it to Europe and\nit starts making another machine, the statute is not\nviolated; and isn't that just what's happening here?\nMR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. This is not a\nmachine tool. The thing that was violated, the machine\nreadable object code, is precisely what is installed on\nthe computer and precisely what is moved from one part\nof the computer to another in different forms as the\ncomputer operates and it continually instructs. This is\ndynamic. It's not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How would you, how would\nyou -- go back for a second, please, because, if you're\nfinished with that, because I don't see how to decide\nfor you without at the same time permitting a person to\nwalk over to the Patent Office, to read that application\nand the description, which after all at least can be a\nvery highly detailed set of instructions of how to make\na machine, getting on the phone, explaining that just\nlike the blueprint which it is just like to somebody in\nEurope. They then make it. And that on your reading\nwould violate the statute. It can't be right that that\nwould and you don't even think it would.\nMR. WAXMAN: I don't because --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And so what's the\ndifference between that and this case for you?\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, there is a\nlong, long spectrum with respect to software that goes,\ngoes from high level system architecture to all the way\ndown through component architecture, pseudo code, source\ncode, which is, which is a description that humans\nunderstand, and the actual machine language that a\ncomputer will understand. Invention -- patents do not\nspecify machine language. The machine code is totally\ndependent on what type of processor it's relating to and\nsomebody who takes source code -- I could make an\nargument that if you take, steal the Microsoft source\ncode, which is the crown jewel, it is the greatest trade\nsecret of this country, it will not be sent overseas,\nbut if somebody took it with a bunch of smart engineers\nand said, you know, convert this into, convert this into\nsomething a computer will understand that will combine\nwith a computer, that involves a question of whether\nwhat's going on overseas is manufacture as opposed to\nassembly.\nLook at it from the perspective -- maybe\nthis helps. Let's look at the question from the\nperspective of Microsoft, the OEM, and the user\noverseas. Object code is the end of Microsoft's\nmanufacturing process. That is what they make. They\ndon't make hard drives, they don't make disks, they\ndon't make computers. They fully finish their product,\nthe Windows operating code, and then send it overseas.\nThe OEM is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That, that code is not\npatentable, you've said.\nMR. WAXMAN: The code is not patentable.\nThe expression is copyrightable. AT&T has not sought to\nget a patent on the code. AT&T has a patent on a system\nthat can be practiced, among other ways, through the use\nof software.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But what is it that they\nexport and send overseas?\nMR. WAXMAN: They export in a variety of\ndifferent physical forms --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right, it's a thing. It's\nan object of some sort, isn't it?\nMR. WAXMAN: It is an intangible sequence of\ncommands that is carrying --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It is an object that has\ncoded onto it, transferred to it in a readable way,\nthose commands. But it's an object, isn't it?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, it's not necessarily an\nobject. I don't know whether you would call a stream of\nphotons that is constantly repeated under the Atlantic\nOcean an object.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, this may,\nthis may help focus that question. Suppose the master\ndisks were made abroad. You would be taking the same\nposition, would you not?\nMR. WAXMAN: If -- that depends how it were\nmade. If it were --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I hope we can continue\ncalling it the golden disk. It has a certain\nScheherazade quality that really adds a lot of interest\nto this case.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, the question\nis what is made. If making it means somehow creating,\nreconfiguring the precise sequence of commands --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No. That's given by\nMicrosoft to one of its offices in Europe. But the\ngolden disk itself is made abroad.\nMR. WAXMAN: If the, if the object code\nitself, the very precise sequence that can't be changed,\nis supplied from the United States --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. WAXMAN: -- the act is implicated.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So the only thing --\nMR. WAXMAN: Regardless of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The only thing supplied\nis this, one side calls it abstract, one side calls it\nsomething else. But anyway, it is the series of 0's and\n1's; that's the only thing that's supplied from the\nUnited States?\nMR. WAXMAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Any physical\nmanifestation of it is done abroad. You would still be\ntaking the position that you're taking, is that not so?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, yes, except that the\nintangible sequence of commands can only be carried in\nthe form of, by attaching it to a physical platform or a\nbucket.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but it doesn't have\nto be --\nMR. WAXMAN: Even a radio wave. Microsoft\nhas patent claims for software.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The physical object does\nnot have to originate in the United States. Can they\nnot transmit the commands to a physical object in\nGermany and have that be the substitute for the golden\ndisk?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, of course, and they do\nthat.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. WAXMAN: They press a button and they\nhave an electronic transmission that sends a stream of\nprotons under the Atlantic Ocean and are changed into\nelectrical impulses that are used to inscribe the\nprecise code onto a hard drive in the form of\nelectromagnetic pulses.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that they now send to\nsome central point which redistributes them. They send\none copy to, say, the wholesaler, who then makes 500\ncopies that are sent to the retail customers, isn't that\ncorrect?\nMR. WAXMAN: That may be. We don't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which is exactly what\nhappens in this case?\nMR. WAXMAN: It's one of the things that\nhappens in this case. We have a stipulated record that\nis not very detailed, but in that instance there is only\none violation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: My question is if that is\nwhat happens, when the retransmission takes place when\none copy is converted into 500 how can those 500 all be\ncomponents rather than copies of the single component?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, the only -- I have two\nanswers to that question, both of them I think directly\nanswering your question. First of all, the statute is\nviolated only when the precise object code is\nexpatriated from the United States, when it is supplied\nfrom the United States. That's the violation. The\nother issues are damages, what damages are you entitled\nto. What is combined with the computer is the precise\nthing that is supplied because it is the precise\nsequence of commands.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But is there any precedent\nfor that sort of thing? That is, I understand your\npoint now, I think, but however you put it, it has to\ncome down to the fact that this very, very complex and\ndetailed thing that is being supplied is an abstract set\nof numbers. And I can understand how the patent\napplication does not itself contain that set of numbers,\nbut rather contains an instruction as to how to generate\nthat set of numbers.\nBut I then would be quite frightened of\ndeciding for you and discovering that all over the world\nthere are vast numbers of inventions that really can be\nthought of in the same way that you're thinking of this\none, and suddenly all kinds of transmissions of\ninformation themselves and alone become components. So\nI'm asking you, is there any outside the computer field\nanalogous instance where the transmission of information\nhas itself been viewed as the transmission of a\ncomponent?\nMR. WAXMAN: I'm not aware of any. In the\nlower courts, Microsoft was arguing that the biotech\nindustry was an analogy, but there is some very obvious\ndifferences between what is supplied in terms of object\ncode that instructs a machine and a, you know, a\nsequence of nucleotides, the abstract sequence of\nnucleotides. But I think we need to be quite precise\nhere. We are not complaining that the component is an\nidea. We're not complaining -- we're not arguing that a\ncomponent is some form of information. What we're\nsaying here is -- I mean, nobody is paying billions of\ndollars from an idea. When the commands are loaded onto\nthe hard drive of a computer in the form of\nelectromagnetic orientations and when you press a button\nsaying give me NetMeeting, and the processor says -- and\nthis is what electrical engineers say -- fetch the\ninstructions, fetch the commands to the random access\nmemory where it's -- where it is there reflected in a --\nin a form of patterns of electrical charges. And when\nthe code then moves back and forth, the instructions\nmove back and forth from the CPU and RAM, they --\nthey -- millions of times a second they are replicating\nthemselves.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is it an answer to\nJustice Breyer, or maybe it isn't, that we have no\nconceptual problem saying there would be liability if\nthis happened within the territorial limits of the\nUnited States?\nMR. WAXMAN: Absolutely not.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And so there shouldn't be\na greater conceptual problem if you prevail, in applying\nit abroad.\nMR. WAXMAN: That's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, sure, there is. It's\na bigger --\nMR. WAXMAN: If I can, I just want to make\nsure I answer your question.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it's totally different\nin that of course it violates the patent in the United\nStates. The whole question here is whether or not the\nperson has to go get a patent in Germany, which he can\ndo or not do. And the -- the concern that I'm worried\nabout is in the future it might be outside your field,\nit might be in biology, but if you suddenly say that the\ntransmission purely of information is the transmission\nof a component, no matter how detailed, I can easily see\nin biology or medicine where a patent has an instruction\nand indeed, that instruction is an instruction to create\nother detailed procedures, processes, dishes, Petri\ndishes, I don't know what it is, and we transmit that\ndetailed information abroad. Then suddenly it's our\npatent law and not the foreign patent law that would\ngovern. That's why I asked for precedent.\nMR. WAXMAN: Okay. First of all, this\nstatute does not reach anything that is done overseas.\nIt doesn't reach what the German OEM does. It doesn't\nreach what anybody does overseas. It -- it makes liable\nas an infringer somebody who supplies -- who is in the\nUnited States who supplies from the United States a\ncomponent with the intent, with the express intent that\nthat component be combined in a way to create a device\nthat would practice a U.S. patent. Now I don't believe\n-- I firmly am confident that if you look at what's at\nissue in this case, there may be all sorts of questions\nabout what is or isn't a component. I might think that\na design is a component or it isn't a component, but\nthink of these three features: One, this is something\nthat is totally modular. It is developed, bought and\nsold entirely independent of any of the hardware to\nwhich it is, with which it is combined, and between\nwhich it moves continuously as it operates. Number two,\nit can be removed or updated entirely independently of\nthe other components. And it is dynamic, unlike\ndesigns, unlike molds, unlike instructions about how to\nmake something, all of which are exhausted. They have\ndone their work when the thing is made. That's why\nthose things are called hardware.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. But --\nMR. WAXMAN: These are instructions not\nabout how to make something. They are instructions\nabout what the other things that are made should do and\nhow they do it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You can perfectly well say\nthat in this case. You can say that the instruction is\nexhausted once the golden disk has sent its information\nthrough an intermediary machine onto the new disk that\nis made.\nMR. WAXMAN: You could not say that because\nif you take the information from a golden master or a\nstream of photons and put it on a hard drive, unless\nthat continues to move and change in form, the computer\nwill not work. The computer operates by having you\npress a button saying do this function. The central\nprocessing unit then says where are my instructions on\nhow to do it. It says find them and put them in random\naccess memory, where it is then replicated in the form\nof patterns of electrical charges, quite a different\nphysical form than it exists on the hard drive. And the\nprogram counter --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That simply means that\nafter the -- the -- the -- the idea as you put it, has\nbeen placed on the hard drive, certain other processes\nmust take place too before we get the result that people\nare buying computers to -- to obtain. But it's still\nthe case that the -- that the code on the golden disk is\nexhausted once that has been transferred from the disk\nthrough an intermediary machine on its way ultimately to\na working computer just -- and my only point is -- just\nthe way you can say that the blueprint in effect is\nexhausted once the house has been built.\nMR. WAXMAN: It's not because the blueprint\nhas no further work to do. It was something that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. You can use it\nagain.\nMR. WAXMAN: Something you teach, has no\nfurther work to do with respect to the infringing\ndevice, but the object code works continuously and gives\ncontinuous instructions to the various hardware\ncomponents completely unlike. But let me go to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The object code has several\njobs. One job when embodied on the golden disk is tell\na -- is to tell a machine how to make disks or how to\nput a message on a hard drive. Another job that the\nobject code has is when the object code gets on the\nresulting disk or the hard drive. But in fact, the\nmanifestation of the object code on the golden disk and\nthe manifestation of the object code on the resulting\ndisk are separable, just as the blueprint is separable\nfrom what is constructed.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Souter, just taking\nyour -- taking that as -- that as the case, the United\nStates in footnote 2 of its brief repeats what Microsoft\nargued in the court of appeals and the district court,\nwhich is that if it took instead of one golden master,\nbut 100,000 CDs, which is what a golden master is, one\nfor each computer, that would be a 271(f) infringement.\nBut that also requires copying and transforming the code\nthat is on the CD-ROM which is in the form of physical\npits and lands and indentations, and downloading it into\nthe hard drive where the same exact sequence is\nmanifested as varying orientations of electronic,\nelectromagnetic fields, and that is no different\nwhatsoever than this case.\nIf you say, well, what destroys you in this\ncase is that the code has to be copied, replication,\nprecise instantaneous replication is simply how software\nworks. It's not just how it's supplied. It's not just\nhow it's combined. It's how it interacts dynamically\nwithin the computer. And that's why we say it's a\ncomponent.\nLet me just be clear about what the\nstatutory interpretation question here is. It's not as\nwhether our conception of the component as the code --\nas the -- as the command is better than their conception\nof the component as a CD or a light wave or a telephone\nwire that contains that.\nThe question is, there may very -- it may\nvery well be both things. The question is whether the\nword component naturally applies to what we do. And our\n-- we have given dozens of references to the use of\nintangible software, program software as components. We\nhave given you the dictionary definition with an example\nfrom Webster's. They have not responded with one\ncounter-example. The only dictionary example they\nprovide you relates to the word \"such\", and it's in\ntheir reply brief on page 5. But they have given you\nnot the first definition of such under Black, in Black's\nEighth, they have given you the second one. The first\none is, of this or that kind, she collects a variety of\nthings. And that definition, under that definition it\nwouldn't matter whether you said, well, the component\nhas to be physical or, you know, it could be either.\nBecause even if it has to be physical --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can you think of any\nmachine -- can you think of any machine other than a\ncomputer that has a component that is not a physical\nthing?\nMR. WAXMAN: I can't. And that's why it\nseems to me, I mean -- and there are -- there are\nmachines that have nonphysical things in them but not\nthat operate in the sort of same dynamic way. We gave\nthe example of the intangible text of Moby Dick in a\nbook. And they give the example of, you know, an\nincredibly complicated series of circuits on a -- on a\nchip. But those don't continue to operate and interact\nin the way that this paradigmatic component does. Thank\nyou.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Waxman.\nMr. Olson, you have, let's see, four minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Justice Scalia. I\nmean Justice Stevens.\n(Laughter.)\nI was about to address Justice Scalia and\nrecite the case -- cite the case Nixon versus\nFitzgerald, which is directly responsive to the question\nJustice Scalia raised at the very beginning of the\naudience, that a stipulation with respect to damages\ndoes not make a case moot. And also with respect to a\nquestion raised by Justice Scalia, or a comment made by\nhim, it doesn't have to be gold. It's a master disk.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry.\nMR. OLSON: What this essentially comes down\nto is something that Mr. Waxman repeatedly said. It is\nthe commands that are a component. The commands to the\nindividual foreign made computers. Those are -- those\ncommands cannot be understood and cannot be used by that\ncomputer unless they are in a physical medium that is\ncreated as a copy of the master disk that sends abroad\n-- that's sent abroad.\nAs I said at the beginning, the stipulation\nis full of the word \"copies\", foreign replicated copies.\nThat's what we're talking about here, something that is\nrecreated. And Justice Breyer, your question about\nsomeone who's got a really good memory and can go abroad\nand recite the 1's and 0's, pictures can be taken,\ncopies can be made in lots of different ways.\nAnd in response to Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: His answer to me is that --\nthat -- it's sort of misleading to think of this as if\nit's just information, because it's really a method that\nswitches things at a level of detail that is impossible\nto put in a patent application. It's taking the\ninformation in a patent application, it's transforming\nit into what we think of as 1's and 0's, but they're not\nreally even 1's and 0's. What they are is things that\nhappen with electricity.\nMR. OLSON: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it's putting that on\nthe disk and then it makes other things happen.\nMR. OLSON: I agree.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's putting something\nphysical on a disk, pits and lands, instructions that\nare copied from the master disk and then put into either\na hard drive or a disk, it's the same thing. It's\nsomething that is into the computer that will make the\ncomputer operate.\nYou're right, Justice Ginsburg, that the\ncourt of appeals for the Federal Circuit thought it was\nbringing this statute up to date and it even said so.\nWe are making an extension of the statute to keep up to\ndate with the technology. That is not for courts to do.\nThis Court is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying that the\ninfringement act that happened in the United States\ninvolved no components?\nMR. OLSON: The infringement that happened\nin the United States which was under Section B, which\nprovides Section B inducement liability for making\ncopies domestically of -- the same thing that happened\nhere. Copies of the object code were put on physical\nmediums and sent to domestic manufacturers. Domestic\nreproduction constitutes infringement under Section\n271(b) but foreign reproduction is not a violation of\nSection 271(a) or 271(b). Hence, we're talking about\nthe two sections where --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So they had a license to do\nthat, because if they didn't have a license to make the\nmaster disk here in the United States, the making of it\nwould have violated the patent; is that right?\nMR. OLSON: The making of the master disk if\nactually used in a computer with a microphone and a\nspeaker, and that's the liability that existed in the\nstipulation under 271(a). Making copies is liability\ndomestically under 271(b). If it's going to be liable\nfor foreign made replications, then it must be under\n271(f). The language of the statute, we submit is\nclear. Physical things must be components under 271(f)\nbecause they must be supplied from somewhere. Ideas\nhave no physical from. They're in the air. The words\nused, \"supplied from\" tells us that it must be a\nphysical thing combined with. Ideas don't combine with\nphysical things to make a patented invention. Physical\nthings do. Thank you, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Olson. The\ncase is submitted.\n[Whereupon, at 11:15 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.]\n54:23 24:8 50:18 2:2,5,9,12 3:3 34:25 brief 3:18 10:20\n8:1 9:2 14:13 27:24 38:5 beginning
