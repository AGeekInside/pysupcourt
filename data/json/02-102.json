        "content": "(11:09 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 02-102, John Geddes Lawrence and Tyron Garner\nv. Texas.\nMr. Smith.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court.\nThe State of Texas in this case claims the right\nto criminally punish any unmarried adult couple for\nengaging in any form of consensual sexual intimacy that\nthe State happens to disapprove of.\nIt further claims that there's no constitutional\nproblem raised by a criminal statute that is directed not\njust at conduct, but at a particular group of people, a\nlaw that criminalizes forms of sexual intimacy only for\nsame-sex couples and not for anyone else in the State who\nhas -- has the right to make a free choice to engage in\nthe identical conduct.\nPetitioners are two adults who were arrested in\na private home and criminally convicted simply because\nthey engaged in one of the forms of sexual intimacy that\nis on the banned list in the State of Texas for same-sex\ncouples.\nThey bring two constitutional claims to the\nCourt today. First, among the fundamental rights that are\nimplicit in our concept of order of liberty, must be the\nright of all adult couples, whether same-sex or not, to be\nfree from unwarranted State intrusion into their personal\ndecisions about their preferred forms of sexual\nexpression. Second, there's no legitimate and rational\njustification under the Equal Protection Clause for a law\nthat regulates forms of sexual intimacy that are permitted\nin the State only for same-sex couples, thereby creating a\nkind of a second class citizenship to that group of\npeople.\nQUESTION: On your substantive due process\nsubmission, Mr. Smith, certainly, the kind of conduct\nwe're talking about here has been banned for a long time.\nNow you point to a trend in the other direction, which\nwould be fine if you're talking about the Eighth\nAmendment, but I think our case is like Glucksberg, say,\nif you're talking about a right that is going to be\nsustained, it has to have been recognized for a long time.\nAnd that simply isn't so.\nMR. SMITH: The Court's cases, Mr. Chief\nJustice, say that history is a starting point, not the end\npoint of the analysis. And I think that it's important to\nlook at history as a whole and one of the errors that I\nthink that the Court made in Bowers v. Hardwick was only\nlooking at the issue in terms of homosexual sodomy and not\nlooking at the issue in general terms, which is the right\nof everyone to decide for themselves about consensual\nprivate sexual intimacy. If you look at the history as a\nwhole, you find a much more complicated picture. First of\nall, you find that sodomy was regulated going back to the\nfounding for everyone and indeed the laws in the 19th\ncentury didn't focus on same-sex couples, they focused on\nparticular --\nQUESTION: Well, you're getting to your equal\nprotection argument now. Let's -- let's separate the two.\nThe first is, your -- your -- your fundamental right\nargument, which has nothing to do with equal protection?\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: So the same-sex/other-sex aspect\ndoesn't come into it --\nMR. SMITH: I think it does come into it,\nbecause if you're going to suggest that the state of the\nlaw on the books in the 19th century is the touchstone you\nhave to take into account that in the 19th century at\nleast on the face of the law married couples were\nregulated in terms of their forms of sexual intimacy that\nwere created for them.\nQUESTION: It may well be, but so were same-sex\ncouples.\nMR. SMITH: Indeed, they all were, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So all same-sex couples could not --\ncould not perform this act lawfully. What more do you\nneed than that? It was prohibited. When you go beyond\nthat and say, oh, but it was also prohibited for -- for\nother sex couples, you're getting into an equal protection\nargument, it seems to me, not a fundamental right\nargument.\nMR. SMITH: I guess I'm suggesting Mr. --\nJustice Scalia, that it's been conceded here by this\nState, it was conceded by the State of Georgia 17 years\nago, that married couples can't be regulated as a matter\nof substantive due process in their personal sexual\nexpression in the home. That means that the state of the\nlaw on the books in the 19th century can't be the deciding\nfactor.\nQUESTION: They conceded it. I haven't conceded\nit.\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor. That may well be true.\nI was -- I was working with the assumption that there may\nbe Justices who -- of the view that married couples do\nhave such a right and I am suggesting that the real issue\nhere is whether that fundamental right extends outside the\nmarital context into other unmarried couples who form\nbonds and have -- and -- for whom sexual intimacy plays an\nequally important role in their lives.\nQUESTION: Were you talking specifically about\nthis Eisenstadt against Baird where there was an unmarried\ncouple -- while there was an unmarried person and the\nconduct in question would have been perhaps in the 19th\ncentury, early 19th century, criminal? Are you talking\nabout fornication?\nMR. SMITH: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. I think the\nCourt in -- has moved from Griswold to Eisenstadt -- has\nmoved in the contraception area outside of the marital\ncontext to the unmarried context, certainly the right --\nthe qualified right to abortion applies to unmarried\npeople, as well as married people.\nCourt in -- in looking at this issue of the scope of the\nfundamental right to make choices about sexual intimacy\nought to take into account not just the state of law on\nthe books in the 19th century but a couple of other\nfactors, one the change in enforcement in the last 50\nyears because the Court's fundamental rights cases all do\nlook at current laws, as well as 19th century law and also\neven in the 19th century, the fact that there's no record\nof active enforcement of these laws against conduct -- of\nadults consensual occurring in the private setting and\nthat's true for married couples, it's true for different-\nsex couples who weren't married, it's true for same-sex\ncouples. The enforcement of the sodomy laws of this\ncountry going back to the founding involves coercion, it\ninvolves children. It involves public activity. It\ndoesn't involve the kind of conduct that's at issue here.\nSo you really have a tradition of respect for\nthe privacy of couples in their -- in their home, going\nback to the founding and I think then what began to happen\nin 1960 was a recognition that we should take that\ntradition and -- and turn it into positive law on the\nbooks.\nAnd so you now had three quarters of the States\nwho no longer regulate this conduct for anyone based on a\nrecognition that it's not consistent with our basic\nAmerican values about the relationship between the\nindividual and the State.\nQUESTION: Well, it depends on what you mean by\nour basic American values, to revert to what the Chief\nJustice was suggesting earlier. Really what's at issue in\nthis case is whether we're going to adhere to -- in the\nfirst part of the case, not the equal protection aspect.\nIt's whether we're going to adhere to what -- what we said\nin -- in Glucksberg, mainly that before we find a\nsubstantive due process right, a fundamental liberty, we\nhave to assure ourselves that that liberty was objectively\ndeeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.\nThat's what we said in Glucksberg and we've said\nit in other cases. Or are we going to depart from that\nand go to the approach that we've adopted with regard to\nthe Eighth Amendment, which is it evolves and changes in\n-- in social values will justify a new perception of what\nis called unusual punishment.\nNow, why should we -- why should we slip into\nthe second mode? I'm -- I mean, suppose all the States\nhad laws against flagpole sitting at one time, you know,\nthere was a time when it was a popular thing and probably\nannoyed a lot of communities, and then almost all of them\nrepealed those laws.\nDoes that make flagpole sitting a fundamental\nright?\nMR. SMITH: No, Your Honor, but the Court's\ndecisions don't look just at history, they look at the --\nat the function that a particular claimed freedom plays in\nthe lives of real people. That's why contraception became\nan issue. That's why abortion became an issue.\nQUESTION: I don't know what you mean by the\nfunction it plays in the lives of real people.\nMR. SMITH: The Court has said that --\nQUESTION: Any law stops people from doing what\nthey really want to do.\nMR. SMITH: The Court has said that it's going\nto use reasoned judgment to identify a realm of personal\nliberty that involves matters of central and core to how a\nperson defines their own lives, and relates to key other\npeople.\nIt's about moral upbringing of children in the\nhome. It's about procreation or nonprocreation in your\nsexual relations with your mate. It's about basic\nquestions of what kind of a family you're going to live\nwith and other intimate associations.\nQUESTION: Well, you say it's about procreation\nor nonprocreation, but none of the cases that you have\ntalked about involved nonprocreation, did they?\nMR. SMITH:\ndecide to engage in sexual relations with -- while\npreventing procreation, that's what -- that's what\nGriswold and Eisenstadt and Carey all say you have a right\nto do. That there's a right to decide whether to bear and\nbeget children and then that right resides with unmarried\npeople as much as it resides with married people.\nAnd I submit to you that it's illogical,\nfundamentally illogical to say that an unmarried couple\nhas a right free of State intrusion to decide whether or\nnot to have procreative sex or nonprocreative sex, but\ndoesn't have the right to be free from State intrusion --\nfree from a law that says you can't have any sexual\nintimacy at all. There's a -- there's a jagged piece\nmissing from the edifice of this Court's substantive\nfundamental rights jurisprudence.\nQUESTION: It doesn't say you can't have -- you\ncan't have any sexual intimacy. It says you cannot have\nsexual intimacy with a person of the same sex.\nMR. SMITH: This particular law does that, yes,\nYour Honor, but certainly our -- our submission is that\nfornication laws and -- and laws involving sodomy\nregulation more broadly would be equally unconstitutional,\nbecause they involve --\nQUESTION: But your position, as I understand\nit, is even if you take the narrowest view of Glucksberg\nand even if you say there's got to be a positive\nhistorical sanction, that in fact there is no historical\n-- no substantial historical evidence to the contrary\nbecause, A, the -- the sodomy laws were not enforced\nagainst consensual activity historically and B, they were\nnot aimed at homosexual as opposed to sodomy in general?\nMR. SMITH: Right.\nQUESTION: Is that -- your historical point, you\nsay even if I accept your argument, I should win?\nMR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. I think first of\nall that the positive law, the law on the books proves too\nmuch because it intruded right into the marital bedroom\nand that the record of enforcement which may be more\ninformative actually supports us rather than supporting\nthe notion that this is something that can be regulated.\nQUESTION: What do you mean by the record of\nenforcement, that there were -- that what happened in this\ncase was an accidental intrusion of the police? They\ndidn't come into the bedroom looking for people conducting\nillicit sexual relations? They were there for another\nreason and happened to discover these -- these men in that\nconduct.\nWhat do you mean by lack of enforcement? The\npolice have not gone around knocking on bedroom doors to\nsee if anyone -- I mean -- this is not the kind of a crime\nthat the police go around looking for, but do you have any\nevidence to show that when they -- when they found it\nbeing committed, they turned a blind eye to it and did not\nprosecute it?\nMR. SMITH: The evidence we have is the -- is\nthe absence of reported cases discussing arrests for that\nkind of conduct.\nQUESTION: Well, that's because it's -- it's an\nact committed in private, and -- and the police respect\nthe privacy of -- of one's home, of one's bedroom, and so\nthey don't investigate and find it.\nBut it seems to me what you would need is\nevidence that when the police discovered this matter, they\nsaid, oh, well, these are not laws that we enforce. I\ndon't see any evidence of that sort.\nMR. SMITH: Certainly it seems to us there's a\nsignificance to the fact that it has never been treated\nas, for example, drug use in the home has been treated.\nAnd people do -- the police obviously do actively seek to\ninfiltrate homes to find that kind of activity, it's been\ntreated in a categorically different way. But perhaps --\nQUESTION: To what extent can you characterize\nit? I mean, the ACLU brief has a lot of evidence along\nthis line. I -- and it seemed to me they want to\ncharacterize it as saying that the history has gone\nexactly the opposite direction than what's been suggested.\nBut if you go back to colonial times really, the laws not\nonly were different but look at the prosecutions. And\nthey did prosecute people for sex crimes. But they didn't\nprosecute people for same-sex crimes. And then if you go\nacross the history, it's only recently that people have\nbeen prosecuted for same-sex crimes. Is that a fair\ncharacterization? What is the real record?\nMR. SMITH: The argument about 19th century\nenforcement is that they didn't prosecute anyone for\nprivate and consensual crimes involving adults, that they\nworried about children, they worried about public\nactivity, they worried about coercion, but that they\ndidn't worry about same-sex or different-sex sodomy. Now\nas to the equal protection point which I think I should\nget to in my remaining time. This is a statute which in\naddition to intruding into that area of important\nfundamental protections, limits its focus just to one\nsmall minority of the people of the State of Texas. It\nsays that these specified forms of sexual intimacy called\ndeviate sexual intercourse are illegal only for same-sex\ncouples and not for anyone else in the State of Texas.\nQUESTION: Well, what about a statute that\ncovered both?\nMR. SMITH:\nunconstitutional under my first point, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. SMITH: I think there is a multiple --\nmultiply unconstitutional statute, because it does the\nsecond thing as well, it says that --\nQUESTION: Well, if the statute covered both,\nwould there be an equal protection argument?\nMR. SMITH: If there was a record of enforcement\nalmost exclusively as to same-sex couples, I think there\nwould be potential constitutional problems there, but the\nstatutory language itself would not involve an equal\nprotection problem of the same sort that we're dealing\nwith here.\nQUESTION: Mr. Smith, aren't there a lot of\nstatutes like that? Aren't there statutes in many States\nabout adultery that don't cover sexual relations of one of\nthe married couple with someone else of the same sex? Are\nthey unconstitutional because of denial of equal\nprotection?\nMR. SMITH: I don't know whether statutes\nactually are written that way, Your Honor. The point I\nwould make is that when a statute --\nQUESTION: What about rape laws? There are --\nthere are rape laws that -- that only apply to -- to\nmale/female rape.\nMR. SMITH: That may be as well. I think --\nQUESTION: You think that they're\nunconstitutional?\nMR. SMITH: I didn't suggest that they're\nunconstitutional. My point is that when a statute is\nlimited to one particular group of people, particularly a\nminority of people in the State, that that limitation\nitself has to be justified under equal protection, that\nthat's a classification of people, not merely a definition\nof conduct. And that if the -- if the justification of\nthe line that was drawn here is -- is insufficient as a\nmatter of mere rationale basis analysis. Because --\nQUESTION: I don't understand that. Suppose the\nState has a rape law that -- that, you know, that really\nrequires the penetration of the female sex organ by --\nwhich is the classic common-law definition of rape, and it\nhas no -- no law of -- about homosexual rape. You think\nthat that law would be unconstitutional?\nMR. SMITH: I think it would have to be\njustified by the State. They may well come in with\nevidence that this is not a problem that needs to be\naddressed or that the victims are more able to protect\nthemselves, they may have -- they may have --\nQUESTION: One step at a time? This is more\ncommon?\nmore -- more -- more -- more odious?\nMR. SMITH: Well, the one thing that I submit,\nthe Court, the State should not be able to come in to say\nis we are going to permit ourselves the majority of people\nin our society full -- full and free rein to make these\ndecisions for ourselves but there's one minority of people\ndon't get that decision and the only reason we're going to\ngive you is we want it that way. We want them to be\nunequal in their choices and their freedoms, because we\nthink we should have the right to commit adultery, to\ncommit fornication, to commit sodomy and the State should\nhave no basis for intruding into our lives but we don't\nwant those people over there to have the same right.\nQUESTION: I mean you you can put it that way,\nbut society always -- in a lot of its laws makes these\nmoral judgments, you can make it sound very puritanical,\nthe -- you know, the laws -- the laws against bigamy, I\nmean, who are you to tell me that I can't have more than\none wife? You blue-nose bigot. Sure. You can make it\nsound that way, but these are laws dealing with public\nmorality. They've always been on the book, nobody has\never told them they're unconstitutional simply because\nthere are moral perceptions behind them. Why is this\ndifferent from bigamy?\nMR. SMITH:\nappeared on the books in the States of this country that\nsingles out only same sex sodomy appeared in the '60s and\nthe '70s and it did not -- and it does not go way back,\nthis kind of discrimination. Now, bigamy involves\nprotection of an institution that the State creates for\nits own purposes and there are all sorts of potential\njustifications about the need to protect the institution\nof marriage that are different in kind from the\njustifications that could be offered here involving merely\na criminal statute that says we're going to regulate these\npeoples behaviors, we include a criminal law which is\nwhere the most heightened form of -- of people protection\nanalysis ought to apply. This case is very much like\nMcLaughlin, Your Honor, where you had a statute that said\nwe're going to give an specially heightened penalty to\ncohabitation, but only when it involves a white person\nwith a black person. That interracial cohabitation is\ndifferent, and the State there made the argument we're\nmerely regulating a particular form of conduct, and that's\na different form of conduct than -- than intro racial\ncohabitation. And this Court very clearly said no.\nYou're classifying people. And that classification has to\nbe justified.\nAnd this Court at many times said a mere\ndisapproval of one group of people, whether it be the\nhippie communes in Moreno or the mentally retarded in\nCleburne, or indeed gay people.\nQUESTION: But all -- almost all laws are based\non disapproval of either some people or some sort of\nconduct. That's why people legislate.\nMR. SMITH: And what this Court does under the\nequal protection clause is -- is -- standard as a bull\nwork against arbitrary government when the -- when there\nis no rational justification for the line that is drawn.\nQUESTION: Well, do you -- do you -- in order to\nwin under an equal protection argument, do you have to\napply some sort of heightened scrutiny?\nMR. SMITH: We certainly do not think we do,\nYour Honor. We think this fails rational basis scrutiny,\njust as the law did in Romer, in Cleburne, in Moreno, in\nEisenstadt, all of those laws were thrown out under\nrational basis scrutiny, because the State basically\ndidn't come up with anything other than we want it that\nway. We want these people to be excluded. We'd had\ndistaste for them. We disapprove of them. It's mere\ndisapproval, or hostility, however historically based, is\nnot sufficient. And certainly even applying the rational\nbasis --\nQUESTION: We said the opposite in Bowers,\ndidn't we?\nMR. SMITH: Well, certainly Bowers is not an\nequal protection case and it didn't involve this kind of\ndiscrimination.\nQUESTION: The equal protection and on to the --\nMR. SMITH: No I was still talking about the\nlevel of scrutiny under equal protection, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Maybe you ought to hold up one hand\nso I'll know which?\nMR. SMITH: It's hard when you have these two\npoints to shift back and forth.\nQUESTION: I understand. We had the same\nproblem in the last case --\nMR. SMITH: Three weeks ago, yes, Your Honor.\nThe -- but the Court in applying even the\nrational basis standard has not been insensitive to the\nreality of what the world is like, and to the fact that\nsome groups of -- some classifications tend to be\ninvolving minorities that have had histories of\ndiscrimination against them and that the overall effect of\nsome line-drawing can be very harmful. In Romer itself,\nthe Court looked at the actual effects of the -- of the\namendment in the Constitution and all of the many ways in\nwhich it caused harm. Here you have a statute that while\nit -- while it purports to just to regulate sexual\nbehavior, has all sorts of collateral effects on people.\nPeople in the States who still regulate sodomy everyday\nthey're denied visitation to their own children, they're\ndenied custody of children, they're denied public\nemployment. They're denied private employment, because\nthey're labeled as criminals merely because they've been\nidentified as homosexuals. And that we submit --\nQUESTION: If you prevail, Mr. Smith, and this\nlaw is struck down, do you think that would also mean that\na State could not prefer heterosexuals to homosexuals to\nteach kindergarten?\nMR. SMITH: I think the issue of -- of\npreference in the educational context would involve very\ndifferent criteria, Your Honor, very different\nconsiderations, the State would have to come in with some\nsort of a justification.\nQUESTION: A justification is the same that's\nalluded to here, disapproval of homosexuality.\nMR. SMITH: Well, I think it would be highly --\nhighly problematic, such a -- such a justification.\nQUESTION: Yes, it would?\nMR. SMITH: If that were the only justification\nthat could be offered, there was not some showing that\nthere would be any more concrete harm to the children in\nthe school.\nQUESTION:\nbe induced to -- to follow the path of homosexuality. And\nthat would not be -- that would the not be enough?\nMR. SMITH: Well, I -- I think the State has to\nhave a greater justification for its discrimination than\nwe prefer pushing people towards heterosexuality. That\namounts to the same thing as disapproval of people's\nchoices in this area and there has to be a more -- more\nreasons and justifiable distinction than simply we prefer\nthis group of people, the majority, instead of this group\nof people, the minority.\nJustice Jackson in the railway express case said\nvery eloquently that the equal protection clause is an\nimportant bulwark against arbitrary government because\nit's there to make sure that legislators don't avoid\npolitical retribution by imposing onerous burdens only on\none minority, but that in fact the majority will live by\nthe same rules as purports to impose on everybody else.\nQUESTION: Mr. Smith before you continue down to\nthe equal protection line. Your first argument was the\nright of personal privacy in one's most intimate sexual\nrelations, you were asked and you didn't get a chance to\nanswer because you went back on your equal protection\ntrack, you are asking the Court to overrule Bowers against\nHardwick. I thought that was very --\nMR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor.\nWe're asking you to overrule it and we think\nthat the right of -- of the fundamental right of unmarried\npeople to make these choices about private adult\nconsensual intimacy applies for different sex couples as\nwell as same sex couples and that Bowers was wrong for\nessentially three reasons, first it posed the question too\nnarrowly by focusing just on homosexual sodomy, which is\njust one of the moral choices that couples ought to\nhave -- that people ought to have available to them.\nAnd second in its analysis of history, which I\nthink I explained already and third, and perhaps most\nimportantly, in the assumptions that the Court made in\n1986 about the realities of gay lives and gay\nrelationships, the Court simply asserted in the Bowers\ncase that there's no showing that has been demonstrated\nbetween the opportunity to engage in this conduct and\nfamily.\nAnd certainly while it may not have been shown\nin that case or even apparent to the Court in 1986, I\nsubmit it has to be apparent to the Court now that there\nare gay families that family relationships are\nestablished, that there are hundreds of thousands of\npeople registered in the Census in the 2000 census who\nhave formed gay families, gay partnerships, many of them\nraising children and that for those people, the\nopportunity to engage in sexual expression as they will in\nthe privacy of their own homes performs much the same\nfunction that it does in the marital context, that you\ncan't protect one without the other, that it doesn't make\nsense to draw a line there and that you should protect it\nfor everyone. That this is a fundamental matter of\nAmerican values.\nSo those are the three reasons we ask you to\noverrule Bowers v. Hardwick as to the fundamental rights\naspect of the case and that we think that that is an area\nwhere the Court should go -- should go back and reconsider\nitself.\nThe Court has now left open for nearly 30 years\nthe question of whether anybody outside has a right -- has\na privacy right to engage in consensual sexual intimacy in\nthe privacy of their home.\nAnd I submit to you, you know, while the Court\nhas left that unanswered, the American people have moved\non to the point where that right is taken for granted for\neveryone.\nMost Americans would be shocked to find out that\ntheir decision to engage in sexual intimacy with another\nperson in their own home might lead to a knock on the door\nas occurred here and a criminal prosecution.\nAnd that -- that reality is something that the\nCourt needs to take into account and certainly in so\ndoing, it shouldn't -- in constructing its fundamental\nrights edifice draw distinctions between gay couples and\nother couples.\nQUESTION: You probably say the same about\nadultery, you think adultery laws are unconstitutional?\nMR. SMITH: I think that the state has --\nQUESTION: I mean think people probably feel the\nsame way about that, you know. It may not be a nice thing\nto do, but I certainly don't expect a knock on the door\nand go to jail for it.\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, adultery is a very\ndifferent case. It involves the State interests in\nprotecting the marital contract which people voluntarily\ntake on. And -- and so in assessing.\nQUESTION: Why is the marital contract important\nto the State? Because it's the source of -- of the next\ngeneration, right?\nMR. SMITH: Sure, the State is --\nQUESTION: And you think that there's not some\nof the same thinking behind the conscious choice of the\nState to favor heterosexual and marital sex over\nhomosexual sex?\nMR. SMITH: Well, I can understand a law which\nsays we're going to attempt to channel heterosexuals\ntowards marriage by making them -- making it illegal for\nthem to have sex without marriage. I can't understand\nthat law under -- under that kind of rational which only\nregulates same sex couples and says you can't have sex but\neveryone else has a right to do that.\nAs for adultery and all of the other parade of\nhorribles which people have raised in their briefs, it\nseems to me you've got to look at the individual interests\nand the State interests and their dramatically different\nin all of those cases incest, prostitution, all of\nthese -- bestiality, all of these things either there's\nvery little individual interests or there's very\nheightened State interest or both, in all of those cases,\nso the idea that by recognizing the right of all adult\ncouples to make choices like this in their own home the\nCourt is going to open up a whole can of worms, I submit,\nis correct.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr. Smith.\nMr. Rosenthal, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROSENTHAL, JR.\nON BEHALF OF TEXAS\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Give me just a moment. Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court.\nThe State humbly submits that enforcement of\nTexas Penal Code Statute 21.06 does not violate the 14th\nAmendment of the Constitution because this Court has never\nrecognized a fundamental right to engage in extramarital\nsexual conduct and because there is a rational basis for\nthe statute sufficient to withstand equal protection\nscrutiny.\nI'd like to begin with a brief discussion of\nsubstantive due process. From a practitioner's\nstandpoint, it appears that the jurisprudence of this\nCourt appears to resolve the means by which the Court\nentertains a claim of novel protected liberty interests.\nSince the Constitution does not expressly\naddress the issue of privacy or of sexual conduct, we look\nto the Court's precedents and to the history of our\npeople.\nIf a historical, traditional analysis applies,\nit then serves as objective guideposts to guide this\nCourt, as long as those ideals and laws do not infringe on\nfundamental rights.\nThe Court has maintained that designation of a\nliberty interest is done -- not done with impunity. But\nonly those interests that appear to be carefully\nidentified asserted rights should be drawn and should be\nconsidered as liberty interests.\ndoes not particularly show which rights the petitioners\nare asking to uphold.\nQUESTION: I -- I don't understand what you mean\nby that. Aren't we clear what right they're seeking to\nuphold?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: No, sir, they're -- they're\nasking for the right of homosexuals to engage in\nhomosexual conduct.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: But there's nothing in the\nrecord to indicate that these people are homosexuals.\nThey're not homosexuals by definition if they commit one\nact. It's our position that a heterosexual person can\nalso violate this code if they commit an act of deviate\nsexual intercourse with another of the same sex.\nQUESTION: Why aren't -- why aren't they seeking\nto vindicate the right of either homosexuals or\nheterosexuals to commit homosexual act? What difference\ndoes that make?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: The difference it makes is as\nthe -- as the record is set out, it does not really define\nthe issues such that the Court can actually give the\npetitioners a -- a specific form of relief.\nQUESTION: But the -- the -- the statute, Texas\nhas already decided that for us.\nhomosexual conduct, so whether it's a heterosexual person\nor a homosexual person, the crime is engaging in\nhomosexual conduct.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: That's correct.\nQUESTION: You don't even have to get to the --\nas I understand it, you don't even have to get to the\ncharacterization of homosexual. The statute clearly\ndefines certain acts committed by or together with\nindividuals of the same sex and that's your class, isn't\nit?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Yes, it is.\nQUESTION: What more do we need?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: We're -- the class actually is\npeople who violate the act, not classes of individuals\nbased upon sexual orientation.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I can see that your point\nmay have some relevance on the equal protection side of\nthe equation, some relevance, I don't think it may be\ncontrolling. It -- it doesn't seem to meet the arguments\nthat's made under the substantive liberty part of the\nargument with reference to Bowers.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: I beg your pardon?\nQUESTION: It doesn't meet the petitioners'\nargument with respect to Bowers versus Hardwick, which\nthey say should be overruled.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, of course we -- we believe\nthat Bowers versus Hardwick is -- is good law. It's\nsubstantial law and that this Court should not overrule\nBowers --\nQUESTION: But that question is certainly\nclearly before us. I mean this is your statute. You\nconvicted the people for these acts and you have to be --\nyou have to defend it.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Yes, sir. And it's our position\nthat Bowers versus Hardwick is still good law, that\nthere's nothing that's changed about the fundamental\nliberties or the -- or the history or traditions of our\ncountry that should make the analysis in Bowers incorrect\nany longer.\nThe petitioner also claims that the mores of our\nnation have changed to the point where physical homosexual\nintimacy is now part of the fabric of American values.\nAnd it's our position this cannot be correct. Even if you\ninfer that various States acting through their legislative\nprocess have repealed sodomy laws, there is no protected\nright to engage in extrasexual -- extramarital sexual\nrelations, again, that can trace their roots to history or\nthe traditions of this nation.\nQUESTION: Their basic argument, I think --\nQUESTION: I -- I'm sorry.\nargument. I thought you were going to say -- you were\nresponding to the argument that the morals haven't\nchanged, or that the morals have changed so that\nhomosexuality is now approved. And you respond to that by\nsaying that there's no tradition? I mean, that's --\nthat's a totally different argument from tradition. I\nmean, the -- the argument is tradition doesn't matter.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, history -- tradition does\nnot matter in terms of whether or not it -- it can be a\nprotected liberty interest.\nQUESTION: Why -- why do you think that the\npublic perception of -- of homosexual acts has -- has not\nchanged? Do you think it hasn't?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: The public perception of it?\nQUESTION: Yes, yes. Do you think there's\npublic approval of it?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Of homosexuals, but not of\nhomosexuality activity.\nQUESTION: What do you base that on?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: I beg your pardon?\nQUESTION: What do you base that on?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, even --\nQUESTION: I mean I think there ought to be some\nevidence which -- which you can bring forward?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Sure.\nQUESTION: Like perhaps the failure of the\nFederal Congress to add the sexual preference to the list\nof protected statuses against which private individuals\nare not permitted to discriminate, that addition has been\nsought several times and it's been rejected by the Federal\nCongress, hasn't it?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Yes, sir, and -- and in\naddition, what I was trying to say by the fact that\nvarious States have changed their position on sodomy,\nthey've done it through the legislative process. And\nthat's where we believe this belongs, is in the State\nHouse of Texas, not this Court.\nQUESTION: Yes, but I thought you were\nresponding to the argument that the public perception\nhasn't changed. That there still is -- is a public\ndisapproval of homosexual acts.\nAnd you can't establish that by saying that the\nStates have repealed their homosexual laws.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, I think it goes back to\nwhether the -- where -- whether people in Texas and people\nin the other States that had this law on their books\nactually accepted through their representative government.\nI think it comes down to the -- the actual people who --\nwho determine the consensus and mores of the State or\nthe -- or the elected legislators.\nQUESTION: Might there be a difference between\nthe people's willingness to prosecute something criminally\nand the people's embracing of that as a fundamental right?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, certainly. And just\nbecause someone has decriminalized sodomy doesn't mean\nthat they embraced that practice as something that ought\nto be taught in the schools as was mentioned before.\nQUESTION: But the argument of -- of Bowers, to\noverrule Bowers is not directly related to sodomy. It's\nrelated, but not directly. It's that people in their own\nbedrooms, which have their right to do basically what they\nwant, it's not hurting other people. And they -- the\nother side -- says Bowers understated the importance of\nthat. It got the history wrong. It didn't understand the\nrelationship of the sodomy to families and in addition,\nBowers has proved to be harmful to thousands and thousands\nand thousands of people, if not because they're going to\nbe prosecuted, because they fear it -- they might be,\nwhich makes it a possible instrument of repression in the\nhands of the prosecutors. Now, that's the kind of\nargument that they're making. Harmful in consequence,\nwrong in theory, understating the constitutional value.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: All right --\nQUESTION: All right, now how do you respond to\nthat?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Okay. First of all, let me --\nlet me correct something that -- that's very minor at this\npoint, but the allegation was made in petitioners'\nargument that people can -- convicted of homosexual\nconduct are banned from jobs and housing and all -- and\nall that kind of thing. In Texas, homosexual conduct is a\nclass C misdemeanor. That is, it is the lowest\nmisdemeanor -- or the lowest prohibition that Texas has.\nQUESTION: That I didn't bring in in my\nquestion.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: My question was, getting those sort\nof three or four basic points, I would like to hear\nyour -- your straight answer to those points --\n[Laughter.]\nQUESTION: -- because on their face, they're --\nI mean, I'm not -- not a criticism, I mean, directly\nresponding, directly responding to the -- to the -- to the\nquestion.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, it's our position that the\nline should be drawn at the marital bedroom, through which\nwe can -- through the law enforcement or anyone else\ncannot pass unless something illegal happens inside that\nbedroom.\nQUESTION:\nthe bedroom door, this case is inside the bedroom, not\noutside. That's the statute makes criminal, to my\nunderstanding, of it what takes place within the bedroom\nthrough consent. Am I right about that?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: You're right about that, but --\nQUESTION: And why isn't that something that the\nState has no business getting involved in --\nMR. ROSENTHAL: First of all, let me say --\nQUESTION: -- as long as it doesn't hurt\nanybody?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: First of all, let me say that\nconsent may be alleged in this case, but consent is not\nproven in the record in this case. There's -- there is\nnothing in the record that shows that people are capable\nof giving consent or that consent was, in fact, given, but\neven given that, I -- I think that the -- that this Court\nhaving determined that there are certain kinds of conduct\nthat it will accept and certain kinds of conduct it will\nnot accept may draw the line at the bedroom door of the\nheterosexual married couple because of the interest that\nthis Court has that this Nation has and certainly that the\nState of Texas has for the preservation of marriage,\nfamilies and the procreation of children.\nQUESTION: Does Texas permit same-sex\nadoptions -- two women or two men to adopt a child or to\nbe foster parents?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: I don't know the answer to that,\nJustice.\nQUESTION: Well, in portraying what Texas sees\nas a family and distinguishing both married and unmarried\nheterosexual people from homosexual people, those things\nwouldn't go together if the State at the same time said\nsame sex couples are qualified to raise a family. You can\nadopt children, you can be foster parents.\nYou don't know what -- what the Texas law is on\nthat?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: I do not know what that Texas\nlaw -- what the Texas law says in that regard.\nQUESTION: I think it would be relevant to your\nargument that they're making -- that Texas is making the\ndistinction between kinds of people who have family\nrelationships and can be proper guardians of children and\nthose who can't.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, again, Your Honor, we're\nnot saying that they can't be proper guardians and we\ncan't say that they can't raise children. That -- that's\nnot the issue. The issue --\nQUESTION: You're fairly certain that they can't\nprocreate children, aren't you?\n[Laughter.]\nMR. ROSENTHAL: We are sure that they -- that\nthey can't do that. But we're also not -- not penalizing\ntheir -- their status. We're penalizing only the\nparticular activity that those unmarried couples may have\nwith respect to whether they have sexual intimacies.\nQUESTION: Does Texas prohibit sexual\nintercourse between unmarried heterosexuals?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, it used to. It does not\ndo that now, unless the sexual intimacy is in public or\nwhere someone might view --\nQUESTION: No, say in a -- a private situation\nlike this, it would not -- it would not be prohibited?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: It does not criminalize it, it\ndoes not condone it.\nQUESTION: What about adultery?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: I beg your pardon?\nQUESTION: What about adultery?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Again, adultery is not penalized\nin Texas, but it is certainly not condoned in Texas.\n[Laughter.]\nQUESTION: All right, so you said -- you said\nprocreation, marriage and children, those are your three\njustifications. Now from what you recently said, I don't\nsee what it has to do with marriage, since, in fact,\nmarriage has nothing to do with the conduct that either\nthis or other statutes do or don't forbid. I don't see\nwhat it has to do with children, since, in fact, the gay\npeople can certainly adopt children and they do. And I\ndon't see what it has to do with procreation, because\nthat's the same as the children.\nAll right. So -- so what is the justification\nfor this statute, other than, you know, it's not what they\nsay on the other side, is this is simply, I do not like\nthee, Doctor Fell, the reason why I cannot tell.\n[Laughter.]\nQUESTION: Now, what is aside -- aside from\nthat?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: I think what -- what I'm saying\nis -- and I had not gotten into the equal protection\naspect of the -- of the argument yet, but under the equal\nprotection argument, Texas has the right to set moral\nstandards and can set bright line moral standards for its\npeople. And in the setting of those moral standards, I\nbelieve that they can say that certain kinds of activity\ncan exist and certain kinds of activity cannot exist.\nQUESTION: Could they say, for example, it is\nagainst the law at the dinner table to tell really serious\nlies to your family?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Yes, they can make that a law,\nbut there would be no rational basis for the law.\nQUESTION: Oh, really. It's very immoral. I\nmean, I know there's certainly -- it's certainly immoral\nto tell very serious harmful lies to your own family under\ncertain circumstances and around the dinner table, some of\nthe worst things can happen.\n[Laughter.]\nBut the -- the -- so Texas could go right in\nthere and any kind of morality that they think is just\nimmoral or bad, cheating, perhaps. What about rudeness,\nserious rudeness, et cetera?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, again, if -- if Texas did\npass the law, it would have to -- have to show through\nsome rational basis test that it's rationally related to\nsome State interest.\nQUESTION: Mr. Rosenthal, don't you think that\nwhat laws a State may constitutionally pass has a lot to\ndo with what laws it has always been thought that a State\ncan constitutionally pass, so that if you have a 200-year\ntradition of a certain type of law -- and I don't know of\na 200-year tradition of laws against lying at the dinner\ntable -- the presumption is that the State is within the\nbounds of -- of the Constitution to pass that law in -- as\ndeclaring what it has proscribed as contra bonos mores, a\nterm that's been in the common law from the beginning as\nagainst good morals, bigamy, adultery, all sorts of things\nlike that, and isn't that determined pretty much on the\nbasis of what kind of laws the State has traditionally\nbeen allowed to pass?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Certainly. And it goes -- it\ngoes to things as diverse as --\nQUESTION: I don't suppose you're going to argue\nthat Loving against Virginia was incorrectly decided, are\nyou?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Oh, certainly not.\nQUESTION: And that was certainly a long\ntradition that supported that --\nMR. ROSENTHAL: But it also violated a\nfundamental right.\nQUESTION: And that's the issue here.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Yes, sir. And the fundamental\nright that was asserted there is -- is a long-established\nfundamental right that we don't -- we don't treat races\ndifferently because we think that one's inferior or we\nstereotype someone --\nQUESTION: There was a constitutional text\nthere, wasn't there, with Loving versus Virginia. I\nthought there was something about a Civil War and no\ndiscrimination on the basis of race.\nMR. ROSENTHAL:\nthe case that was cited from Florida.\nQUESTION: When -- when did Texas select\nhomosexual sodomy as -- as a subject of specific criminal\nprohibition?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Sodomy as a -- as a --\nQUESTION: My question --\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: Go ahead, but my question is --\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: -- is about sodomy among two adults\nof the same sex?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Yes, sir. And sodomy had -- has\na longstanding tradition of the history of Texas of sodomy\nbeing against the law, however --\nQUESTION: When -- when was -- was the first\nstatute passed? I think 200 years was mentioned. Was\nthere a law in the books in 1803?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: No, I don't think Texas was a\nState back then.\n[Laughter.]\nQUESTION: It doesn't have to be -- it doesn't\nhave to --\nQUESTION: Territorial --\nQUESTION: It's a trick question, Mr. Rosenthal.\nDon't -- don't fall into that trap.\n[Laughter.]\nQUESTION: 1803 or the first date of the Texas\nlegislature's meeting, did they pass it at the -- at the\nfirst meeting of the legislature?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, certainly in the -- in the\n1854 Penal Code, the -- the kinds of activity that -- that\nwere classified now as sodomy were against the law.\nHowever, I think to address your question --\nQUESTION: When did -- when did they single out\nhomosexual sodomy?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: In 1973, in the passage of the\n1974 Penal Code.\nQUESTION: So the issue here doesn't have much\nof a longstanding tradition specific to this statute, does\nit?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, not specific to -- not\nspecific to that statute, but it has a longstanding\ntradition in Texas as being something that should be\nproscribed and something that is regarded as immoral and\nunwholesome.\nQUESTION: Well, homosexual sodomy was unlawful\nin Texas from when? There was not a statute addressed\njust to that. It was addressed to sodomy in general, but\nhomosexual -- but homosexual sodomy included, and that law\ngoes back how long? To 1803?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: To the -- to the time that Texas\nwas a republic, before it --\nQUESTION: But what about the statute which this\nCourt I think once had to grapple with, people felt during\nWorld War I that it was immoral to teach German in the\npublic schools. So then would you say that the State has\nevery right to do that, parents want their children to\nlearn German, but the schools forbid it? See, the hard\nquestion here is can the State, in fact, pass anything\nthat it wants at all, because they believe it's immoral.\nIf you were going to draw the line somewhere, I guess you\nmight begin to draw it when the person is involved inside\nhis own bedroom and not hurting anybody else. Now that --\nthat now -- so you say it's morality. I -- I agree many\npeople do believe that that's a question of morality.\nMany do not, but nonetheless, what can you add to what\nyou're saying, other than simply asserting its morality?\nBecause I don't think you think that the State could pass\nanything in the name of morality?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Certainly not. But it would\nhave -- any law that would pass would have to have some\nrational basis to the State interest.\nQUESTION: You've not given a rational basis\nexcept to repeat the word morality.\nQUESTION:\nState thinks it immoral just as the State thinks adultery\nimmoral or bigamy immoral.\nQUESTION: Or teaching German.\nQUESTION: Well, that --\n[Laughter.]\nQUESTION: Maybe we should go through counsel,\nyes.\nQUESTION: Isn't the -- Mr. Rosenthal, isn't the\nthrust of Justice Breyer's question that when -- when the\nState criminalizes behavior as immoral, customarily what\nit points to is not simply an isolated moral judgment or\nthe moral judgment alone, but it points to a moral\njudgment which is backed up by some demonstration of harm\nto other people.\nWe -- we've heard questions for example about\nharm to a -- a marital institution. It makes sense to say\nwhether you think the law is enforceable or not. It makes\nsense to say that adultery threatens the -- the durability\nof a particular instance of marriage.\nWhat kind of harm to others can you point to in\nthis case to take it out of the category of simple moral\ndisapproval, per se?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, part of the -- part of the\nrationale for the law is to discourage similar conduct,\nthat is, to discourage people who may be in jail together\nor want to experiment from doing the same kind of thing\nand I think -- and I think that the State can do that.\nPeople can harm themselves and still be -- and still have\nit be against the law. But they can take drugs and do\nthat.\nQUESTION: Well, do you point to a kind of harm\nhere to an individual or to the individual's partner,\nwhich is comparable to the harm that results from the --\nthe harm to the deterioration of the body and the mind\nfrom drug-taking? I mean, I don't see the parallel\nbetween the two situations.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, not -- not only do we say\nthat morality is a basis for this, but of course the\nantecedents have raised that there may also be health\nconsiderations. I don't know whether there are or not.\nQUESTION: That is not the State's claim in any\ncase?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: That's not the State's claim,\nbut I can't say that it's not true. Obviously this --\nthis has --\nQUESTION: Did you read -- I don't know -- I\ncan't remember now who filed it, but there was one medical\nbrief filed on that subject and the argument there was\nthat, in fact, these laws are -- are directly antithetical\nto health claim.\nmake on that brief?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Yes, sir. There was a law filed\non behalf of the respondents that took exactly the\nopposite position.\nQUESTION: So the issue was open, so far as --\nas we're concerned that that would be your position, I\ntake it?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Yes, sir, for each expert\nthere's an equal and opposite expert.\nQUESTION: But you're not saying the State of\nTexas is doing this for -- to protect the actors who are\ninvolved in this? One can say the State is taking action\nto see that people don't harm others or themselves.\nYou're not suggesting that that's the reason for -- for\nthis particular law?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, I think Texas has the\nright to prohibit certain conduct.\nQUESTION: But if that's the reason for it, why\ndoesn't Texas prohibit the conduct in a heterosexual\nrelationship? I mean, it doesn't seem to be any harm\nbecause if there were a harm, beyond moral disapproval,\nthe law would not be restricted to homosexuals.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, because heterosexual\nconduct is -- the same kinds of conduct -- and by the way\nit's not distinguished, it's still called deviate sexual\nintercourse with heterosexuals.\nQUESTION: But it's not prohibited?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: But it's not prohibited.\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: But it also can lead to marriage\nand to procreation. And that's -- and that's a legitimate\nState interest.\nQUESTION: But -- but procreation -- many people\nwith the blessings of Texas can have sexual relations who\nare unable to procreate, so I don't see how -- whatever\nthe line might have meant in times gone, it certainly\nisn't true that sexual relations are for the purpose of\nprocreation and anything that is not for that purpose is\nbeyond the pale.\nYou can't make that distinction.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: No, but I think as a matter of\npublic policy, the State can make -- have -- can have\npreferences -- and again it doesn't say that simply\nbecause heterosexual people can -- can have deviate sexual\nintercourse, the State approves it. There are just simply\nother sanctions that the -- that the State may imply.\nI did want to briefly distinguish this case from\nyour decision in Romer v. Evans. And obviously the\ndistinction there was -- was that the Colorado amendment\nsought to classify people based on their orientation and\nnot their conduct. And by so doing, they excluded a\ncertain class of people from the political debate. Now,\non the contrary, Texas welcomes all into the political\ndebate and -- in the last Texas legislature, fortunately\nour legislature meets only every other year, but in the\nlast Texas legislature, there was a hate crime statute\npassed which made it a more heinous crime to make someone\na victim of crime based upon their sexual orientation and\nit included all sexual orientations. It included\nhomosexuals, bisexuals and heterosexuals, all, so I don't\nthink we can say across the board that there's some sort\nof Texas policy that we're trying to overall discriminate\nagainst -- against homosexuals as a group.\nQUESTION: Somebody wants to participate in the\npolitical process, run for political office who is\nhomosexual and the charge is made on the other side don't\n-- don't vote for this person, this person is a law\nbreaker, there is a closer connection to Romer in that\nregard, isn't there?\nMR. ROSENTHAL: Well, that would be true, if it\nweren't that the historical fact that that's not in fact\ntrue. That there have been people who have campaigned in\nTexas and have admitted their homosexuality and have been\nelected to office.\nQUESTION:\ncharged as law-breakers.\nMR. ROSENTHAL: No, ma'am, they can't be charged\nas law-breakers for having that orientation. They can\nonly be charged as law-breakers if they commit that\nparticular act. And then, again, the State does not allow\nany disabilities to come from class C misdemeanor acts.\nI'm sure it's obvious to this Court that the\nissues of homosexual rights are highly emotional for the\npetitioner in these quarters but equally anxious in this\nCourt's -- for this Court's decision are those who are,\nnumber one, concerned with the rights of States to\ndetermine their own destiny, and, two, and possibly more\nimportant, those persons who are concerned that the\ninvalidation of this little Texas statute would make --\nwould make marriage law subject to constitutional\nchallenge.\nThen again, how far behind that can there be\nother acts of sexual gratification brought for\nconstitutional challenge also. There's already movements\nto lower the age limit of consent for children engaged in\nsexual practices. And there are secondary effects,\nparticularly in Texas law, where we are a common law state\nand the common law is based upon community property shared\nby both spouses. The State of Texas is asking this Court\nto be mindful of the far-reaching aspects of your decision\nin this case, so as not to disenfranchise 23 million\nTexans who ought to have the right to participate in\nquestions having to do with moral issues. We ask you to\naffirm the Texas Court of Appeals.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nRosenthal.\nMr. Smith, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I\njust have a couple of points to make. I thought I might\naddress this question of what it was that we proved in the\nrecord below and whether or not we have, as a result,\nadequately teed up the issues before the Court without\nhaving put into evidence directly that this was a\nnoncoercive act or a noncommercial act or a nonpublic act\nor things of that kind.\nOur position is that this is a criminal statute\nthat has only two elements, it has a list of particular\nkinds of sexual intimacy that you're not allowed to engage\nin and it they have to prove as well that the two people\ninvolved were of the same sex.\nThere was a complaint that was filed that listed\nthose two elements. My clients pleaded no contest to\nthose two elements but said that there is an insufficient\nbasis for imposing criminal liability on them, because,\nfirst of all, they invade fundamental rights and second of\nall, because the law is discriminatory, while it's\nsupposedly got a moral basis, it's a discriminatory\nmorality, a morality imposed only on one category of\ncouples in a State which does not penalize in any way\nadultery, fornication or sodomy for people of -- of\ncouples that are different sex.\nThose are the arguments that were made and -- so\nour position is that that the statute is unconstitutional\nboth facially and as applied here, because the State\npurports to impose liability based on those two elements\nalone and that they are constitutionally insufficient\nbases both for fundamental rights reasons and because it's\na discriminatory state.\nThe other point I thought I might just address\nfor the moment is the public health rationale which didn't\ncome up before. Essentially, what the facts are -- and I\nthink this comes out to a large extent, it's undisputed in\nthe amicus briefing -- the issue is not briefed in here\nbecause the Texas brief doesn't even attempt to make this\nargument, but it is -- the facts are that if this was the\nline between safe and unsafe forms of sexual intimacy it's\nas if the law cuts right across it. Regulating some of\nthe most safe forms of sexual activity possible,\nincluding, for example, lots of safe sex -- same-sex\nactivity involving women and leaving completely\nunregulated all sorts of forms of unsafe sexual activity\ninvolving different sex couples.\nSo if there was ever a case of a law where the\nfit is egregiously improper and insufficient to justify\nthe law under the rational basis test, this would be such\na case.\nUnless the Court has further questions, thank\nyou very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you Mr. Smith.\n"
