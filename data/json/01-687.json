        "content": "(10:01 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 01-687, the United States v. Leonard Cotton, et\nal.\nMr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case is typical of many Federal drug\nprosecutions that were tried before this Court's decision\nin Apprendi v. New Jersey. Respondents were indicted on a\nsuperseding indictment that alleged a conspiracy to\ndistribute cocaine and cocaine base without alleging a\nspecific threshold quantity of drugs that were involved in\nthe offense.\nRespondents were convicted of that offense at\ntrial, and the evidence established at trial that the\noffense involved well in excess of 50 grams of cocaine\nbase, the threshold quantity of drugs to authorize a\nminimum sentence of 10 years and a maximum sentence of\nlife imprisonment.\nAt sentencing, as all parties expected, the\njudge made findings of drug quantity and determined that\nthe quantities of drugs involved in the offense justified\na sentencing range up to life imprisonment and imposed\nsentences on several respondents of life imprisonment and\nothers of 30 years imprisonment.\nRespondents made no objection to the judge's\nprocedure in determining drug quantity himself without a\njury trial determination on that issue or without an --\nQUESTION: Well, at -- at sentencing, is it --\nit -- it's really not that much of a burden to just send\nit back to the judge and tell him to do it right. Suppose\nhe had sentenced under the wrong section or something like\nthat. We'd just send it back.\nMR. DREEBEN: The problem in this case, Justice\nKennedy, is that the court of appeals has held that the\nomission of a drug quantity allegation from the indictment\nis a jurisdictional error that always requires automatic\ncorrection on plain error review regardless of the\nstrength of the evidence against respondents on the\nquestion or on whether respondents had notice that they\nwould face an increased sentence as a result of enhanced\nquantities of drug --\nQUESTION: Well, but -- but in order to test\nthat, I'm just asking -- it's not as if we have to have a\nnew trial. In fact, I -- I doubt that you could have a\nnew trial unless everybody stipulated to it.\nMR. DREEBEN: It's --\nQUESTION: All that happens is there's a new\nsentencing hearing. That -- that's not that big of a --\nof -- a great a burden on the courts and on their\nresources. We don't have to have some huge trial. It's\njust a resentencing hearing.\nMR. DREEBEN: What will happen if the -- this\nCourt affirms the judgment of the court of appeals is that\nrespondents will not be subject to the sentences that\nCongress authorized and that the evidence unequivocally\nshowed in this case were justified.\nQUESTION: You're not objecting to --\nQUESTION: Aren't we really just arguing about\n-- are we really just arguing about retroactivity then?\nMR. DREEBEN: In this case we're not arguing\nabout retroactivity. What we're arguing about is plain\nerror. Respondents never made a constitutional objection\nin the district court to the procedure by which they were\nsentenced. They never even objected as a factual matter\nto the proposition that their offenses involved 50 grams\nof cocaine base or more, which is all that is required in\norder to support a statutory increase in the sentence.\nAnd notwithstanding their failure to object, the court of\nappeals concluded that plain error analysis always\nrequires vacation of the enhanced sentence, and the\nGovernment does not get a chance to seek the enhanced\nsentence on --\nQUESTION: Here, the -- the verdict of the jury\ncorresponded to the indictment, I take it. It -- it\nwasn't a case where the indictment failed to allege an\nelement of the offense which the jury found.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct. The indictment in\nthis case charged a complete offense under 21 U.S.C. 846,\nthe drug conspiracy --\nQUESTION: Except that under Apprendi, the --\nthe quantity may become an element, in effect. This was\ntried before Apprendi --\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct.\nQUESTION: -- came down.\nMR. DREEBEN: This case was tried before\nApprendi.\nQUESTION: If it had been tried after Apprendi\ncame down, there might, in fact, be a notice problem I\nassume.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, absolutely, Justice O'Connor.\nPost Apprendi, the Government understands that it's its\nobligation to include an allegation of drug quantity in\nthe indictment. This case, which was tried pre Apprendi,\nwas done in a regime in which all parties understood that\nan allegation in the indictment of a conspiracy offense,\nwith no specification of drug quantity, did not limit the\nGovernment to proving increased quantities of cocaine\nbase.\nQUESTION: Well, for your position to prevail\nhere, do we have to overrule Ex parte Bain or somehow set\nthat aside, which seems to suggest that if it's not in the\nindictment, it's a jurisdictional problem?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice O'Connor, this Court\nalready has overruled Ex parte Bain on its square holding,\nwhich is that the narrowing of an indictment is\nimpermissible and deprives the court of jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: But the -- the Government can surely\nalso argue that Ex parte Bain by its terms doesn't\napply --\nMR. DREEBEN: Ex parte --\nQUESTION: -- to this case because the\nindictment and the verdict corresponded, and that was\ndifferent from Ex parte Bain.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, that -- that is a difference\nfrom Ex parte Bain, Chief Justice Rehnquist, but we don't\ndispute that in this case, post Apprendi, there is an\nerror in the sense that drug quantity is treated as a\nconstitutional element.\nQUESTION: Yes. There can be an error but not a\nmatter of -- not going to a matter of jurisdiction.\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct. And the fundamental flaw\nin Ex parte Bain was to treat a constitutional error\narising under the Fifth Amendment's Indictment Clause as\nif it were a jurisdictional error. And it's our\nsubmission that the reason that the Court did that is\nbecause at the time, in the 19th century, on habeas\ncorpus, relief was available only for jurisdictional\nerrors, which led this Court to treat a variety of\nconstitutional errors as though they were jurisdictional.\nQUESTION: Well, and because there was no right\nof direct appeal.\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct. So, the -- the result\nwas that a -- the Court had broadly characterized a\nvariety of constitutional errors as if they were\njurisdictional errors, but later decisions of this Court\nmake clear that the failure of an indictment to charge any\noffense is not a jurisdictional error.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, you would like us to\nmake that clear, wouldn't you, because it isn't in our\ncases so far, that that kind of error, whatever it is,\ndoesn't qualify as, quote, jurisdictional?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. We think\nthat the time is -- is right in this case to make it clear\nthat that's not a jurisdictional error.\nQUESTION: There -- there are many instances\nwhere the Court has said that an error is -- that -- that\na requirement, certain requirement, is mandatory and\njurisdictional. That word has been used in -- in many\ndifferent contexts. And are you suggesting some approach\nto the -- what is jurisdictional so that there won't be\nthis string of things that the label jurisdictional is\nappended to?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, jurisdictional has been\nappended as a label to a variety of kinds of errors, but\nthe relevant sense in which it's being invoked in this\ncase and in which the lower court understood it was a kind\nof defect that may be raised at any time regardless of an\nobjection and that is tantamount to subject matter\njurisdiction, the sort of error that is so fundamental to\nthe proceedings that harmless error review and plain error\nreview simply don't apply.\nNow, the court of appeals in this case did, as a\nformal matter, apply rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure, the harmless error rule. But it also\nrepeatedly stated that errors relating to the indictment\nprocess are jurisdictional, and the failure of an\nindictment to charge an offense violates a mandatory rule\nand creates a jurisdictional error. And that led to the\nconclusion that this Court's precedents in Neder v. United\nStates and Johnson v. United States simply don't apply and\nthat the weight of the evidence against respondents in\nthis case and their possession of notice that they would\nface increased sentences under the drug statute --\nQUESTION: May I ask what you rely on for the\nnotice proposition?\nMR. DREEBEN: In -- in the factual record --\nQUESTION: Are you relying on the general run of\ncases or the fact there was a preceding indictment?\nMR. DREEBEN: In this case, Justice Stevens, we\nrely most fundamentally on the fact that the state of the\nlaw at the time of respondents' indictment was that all\ndefendants understood that notwithstanding the absence of\na --\nQUESTION: But you're not really relying on the\nfact there had been a prior indictment that was withdrawn\nand superseded.\nMR. DREEBEN: We don't have to rely on that. I\nthink the prior indictment makes clear that the Government\nbelieved that this conspiracy --\nQUESTION: It believed at the time they filed\nthe prior indictment, but when they withdraw it and file a\nsecond indictment, you normally would think they've\nwithdrawn the charges that have been withdrawn.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, not in view of the fact that\nat the prevailing legal regime at the time --\nQUESTION: That's a separate point, and I\nunderstand that point. But it seems to me you'd make that\npoint even if there had been no original indictment.\nMR. DREEBEN: I would. And I think it's\nimportant to underscore that the superseding indictment\ndidn't give the defendants the impression that the\nGovernment was retreating in the scope of its proof. To\nthe contrary, the superseding indictment expanded the\nconspirators from 9 to 14. It expanded the length of the\nconspiracy --\nQUESTION: Yes, but it withdrew the quantity\nallegation.\nMR. DREEBEN: It didn't withdraw all references\nto quantity, Justice Stevens. If you look at the\nsuperseding indictment, it alleges that there were multi-\nkilogram cocaine shipments and multi-kilogram --\nQUESTION: Well, I thought we were taking the\ncase on the assumption that the indictment did not charge\nenough to get the sentences that they received.\nMR. DREEBEN: And that's correct. But what --\nQUESTION: Whereas the earlier indictment did.\nMR. DREEBEN: The earlier indictment in terms\nsaid this offense involves more than 50 grams of cocaine\nbase. The later indictment didn't say that. But if you\ndo read the allegations in the later indictment, it's\nimpossible that anyone could come away thinking that the\nGovernment had narrowed the scope of the conspiracy it\nintended to prove.\nAnd respondents didn't take it that way. There\nis information in the detention hearings of at least four\nother respondents that indicates that they understood that\nthis was the kind of cocaine conspiracy -- cocaine base\nconspiracy that, if proved, would expose them to a life\nsentence. They had a full opportunity to try to contest\nthat evidence if they wished to do so.\nWhat the respondents did instead was attempt to\nsay we weren't part of this --\nQUESTION: Let me just interrupt you by saying I\nthink it would be most unfortunate if we decided this case\non the particular fact that there was an original\nindictment and a superseding indictment. This was case\nwould mean nothing if that's all we have.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't think it would mean\nnothing, Justice Stevens, but we are asking the Court to\nrule on the broader ground that when an indictment fails\nto allege what we now understand to be an element of the\noffense, but the evidence is sufficiently powerful so that\nany rational grand jury, if asked, would have found that.\nQUESTION: What does the -- what does the\nGovernment's position do to the Stirone case?\nMR. DREEBEN: Nothing, Chief Justice Rehnquist,\nbecause Stirone was a case in which two features are\npresent that are not present here. First of all, the\ndefendant in Stirone repeatedly objected to the broadening\nof the indictment in that case. There the indictment had\nalleged that there was an effect on interstate commerce\nfrom an extortion as a result of obstruction of commerce\nin sand. And the Government got to trial and attempted to\nprove that the sand would have been used to build a steel\nmill, the steel mill would have exported steel to other\nStates, and that was the effect on commerce that had been\nobstructed. The defendants vociferously objected, but the\njudge allowed that to go to the jury. So, that case is\nnot like this case, a plain error case. It is a harmless\nerror case.\nAnd furthermore, the respondents -- or the --\nthe defendants in Stirone had a plausible claim that they\nwere deprived of notice of the kinds of charges that they\nwould actually face at trial; whereas in this case, there\nis not a claim, a plausible claim, that the defendants did\nnot know that they would face an increased sentence if the\nGovernment established that the crime involved more than\n50 grams of cocaine base.\nQUESTION: Can you tell me, post Apprendi in the\ntrial courts, can the defendant agree with the Government\nto plead guilty but leave it to the judge to determine the\namounts of the drug involved?\nMR. DREEBEN: It's a little unclear, Justice\nKennedy, whether the defendant can do that because\ntypically the Government has not acquiesced and the courts\nhave not been hospitable to partial pleas of guilty. And\nin effect, the defendant would be tendering a partial plea\nto an aggravated drug offense and then asking the judge to\ndecide one element of the offense. Under pre-Apprendi\nlaw, that procedure would not be followed in any circuit.\nNow, there have been some defendants who really\nwould be willing to plead to the underlying offense and\ncontest drug quantity, and I haven't had a chance to see\nwhether that has played out in the district courts with\nany courts allowing that to happen.\nQUESTION: And what does the Government do when\nit indicts? There's -- there's no stipulation of any\nkind. Does it have three or four counts and -- and it\nalleges the -- the maximum amount and then -- and then a\nsmaller amount and then another amount? Three different\ncounts?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Kennedy. We allege\nthe amount of threshold quantity of drugs that we believe\nwe can prove at trial. If the trial evidence then\nestablishes that a rational jury could find guilt on the\nunderlying offense but still have a doubt about drug\nquantity, then the Government would be entitled to a\nlesser included offense.\nQUESTION: Lesser included offense.\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct. And -- and the lower\ncourts have understood that that's the appropriate\nanalysis in a case like that.\nQUESTION: I guess part of the problem in this\ncase is that if we say that defendants are entitled to the\nbenefit of a change in the law before their conviction\nbecomes final, there's not much you can do because you'd\nhave to issue a superseding indictment and you can't do\nthat.\nMR. DREEBEN: We can't do it in this case,\nJustice Kennedy, which is why, in effect, the result that\nthe court of appeals achieved is a tremendous windfall for\nthe defendants. They never raised a constitutional\nobjection at trial. They never contested the amount of\ndrugs involved in the offense. The statute clearly\nauthorizes a life term for the conduct that was proved,\nand the evidence supports that --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I don't know they'd\nobject. Does he stand up during the prosecution's case\nand say, well, we just want you to know that you're not\ndoing a very good job of proving the amounts? I mean,\nwhat's -- what's he supposed to do? That -- that -- I\ndon't understand when the objection would take place.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the objection could take\nplace at trial when a defendant could have said the\nGovernment has to prove this quantity up to the jury or it\ncould --\nQUESTION: No, but it -- it doesn't. I mean,\nthe -- the point at which the -- the failure to indict and\nallege on quantity becomes objectionable is at sentencing.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, that's --\nQUESTION: So, there would be no reason to.\nMR. DREEBEN: That was just what I was about to\nsay, Justice Souter. The -- the most pertinent time for\nthe defendant to object would be at sentencing, and there\nare defendants who raise the kind of constitutional\nobjection that this Court alluded to in the Jones decision\nin 1999 and later accepted in the Apprendi decision in the\nyear 2000. There were defendants who raised that\nconstitutional objection, and they are entitled to the\nbenefit of harmless error review. Those defendants who do\nnot raise that constitutional claim are subject to plain\nerror review. And this Court has repeatedly recognized\nthat even the type of error that might entitle a defendant\nto reversal on harmless error review, regardless of the\nstrength of the evidence, does not automatically entitle\nthe defendant to relief on plain error review.\nIn Johnson v. United States, this Court\nconsidered a very analogous type of error. There the\ntrial court convicted the defendant of a perjury offense\nwithout sending materiality to the petty jury. So, there\nwas no petty jury determination of materiality. The\ndefendant made no objection to that, and on appeal, this\nCourt held that the appropriate standard is plain error\nreview because the defendant had never objected. And when\nthe evidence is overwhelming and uncontestable -- and\nuncontested at trial, the Court concluded that it is\naffirmance that supports the integrity of the judicial\nsystem rather than reversal.\nQUESTION: The prejudice to you is that you\ncannot reindict, but the objection would be irrelevant to\nthat.\nMR. DREEBEN: The objection --\nQUESTION: So, I mean --\nMR. DREEBEN: The objection would not be\nirrelevant because -- for two different reasons. First of\nall, the -- the defendant, had he objected at the\npertinent time and had the Government concluded that this\nwas an objection that we should worry about, could have\nsought indictments on other counts relating to substantive\ndrug violations if it believed that the sentence that it\nwas about to obtain was not sufficient. We're not in that\nposition today because it's the year 2002, and the statute\nof limitations will have run on many other drug offenses\nthat we might have brought.\nQUESTION: Oh, you mean you could have just hit\nhim with another -- hit the defendants with another\nindictment in another case without a double jeopardy\nproblem.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, any -- a substantive drug\ncount is a separate offense from a conspiracy offense.\nThis Court has held that in Felix v. United States and\nreaffirmed it more broadly in United States v. Dixon. So,\nthere would have been no double jeopardy objection.\nBut the Government is no longer in the position\nwhere we can extricate ourselves from the -- the dilemma\nthat the court of appeals has placed us in. These\ndefendants will not receive the sentence that the\nsentencing guidelines called for and that the statute\nauthorizes. And the fact that they did not make a timely\nobjection puts them in a very different position than a\ndefendant would be who had timely objected.\nQUESTION: The difference is --\nQUESTION: The actual difference, as a practical\nmatter, is between life -- a life sentence and 20 years.\nRight?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right. That's right.\nQUESTION: And that, Mr. Dreeben, seems to me a\nsubstantial difference. So, I follow your argument at the\n-- the very last step in a plain error analysis, but you\nseem to stop short of that and you said there wasn't any\nsubstantial difference. And I think that that's\ntroublesome because the disparity in sentencing is large.\nMR. DREEBEN: The disparity in sentencing is\nlarge both from the Government's point of view and from\nthe defendant's point of view. The way that the\nGovernment looks at this question is would the defendant\nhave gotten the same sentence if he had been accorded the\nprocedures that he now claims that he should have been\ngiven. If the Government had understood that it had to\nobtain an indictment that mentioned drug quantity and it\nhad understood that the Constitution required the jury,\nnot the judge, to make that finding, would the defendant\nbe better off or the same off?\nThat is exactly the kind of analysis that the\nCourt used in Johnson v. United States and Neder v. United\nStates. It looked at whether the -- the availability of\nthe procedure that the defendant has been deprived of\nwould have made a difference to him. Of course, it would\nmake a difference to him if he could have compelled the\nsentencing judge to drop down to 20 years as a result of\nthe Government's failure to put drug quantity in the\nindictment, and that's what would happen today if this\ncase were unfolding in a post-Apprendi world.\nBut in a pre-Apprendi world, particularly where\nthe defendant didn't object, it makes more sense to look\nat the problem as one of a deprivation of procedure and to\nask whether the possession of the procedure would have --\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, can I ask you this\nquestion? I understand it's not this case, but would the\nGovernment -- what -- what would the Government's position\nbe if the evidence of quantity came out after the trial\nwas concluded just as a result of a pre-sentence\ninvestigation and then a finding by the judge? What would\n-- what should happen in that kind of case?\nMR. DREEBEN: In that kind of case, our position\nwould be the same, that particularly on plain error\nreview, the Court should look to the entire --\nQUESTION: Even though the evidence was not\nbefore the jury.\nMR. DREEBEN: Right, even though --\nQUESTION: Because Neder wouldn't apply to that.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, it's not clear that -- that\nNeder wouldn't apply to it. It's true that in Neder\nitself, the Government proved up all of the evidence\nrelevant to materiality at the trial. But in many cases,\nthat were tried --\nQUESTION: But you would take the same position\neven if all the evidence developed post-trial during the\npre-sentence investigation.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right. We would. But, as\nYour Honor has indicated, the Court wouldn't have to agree\nwith that in order to sustain in this case.\nAnd this case is the far more typical one in\nwhich the grand jury investigation itself developed\nsubstantial evidence of drug quantity. Everybody knew\nthat before the trial, and the trial evidence itself is\nwhere the evidence of drug quantity was adduced.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, I -- I'm not sure I --\nyou say we should determine whether substantial rights\nhave been affected by -- by asking whether if the\nprocedure that has been omitted had not been omitted, he\nwould have been -- he would have been convicted anyway. I\n-- I just -- that -- that seems to me extravagant. I\nmean, that -- that would mean that if there were no\nindictment at all, you just go to the jury without an\nindictment and the jury convicts him of murder, you could\ncome in and say, well, his substantial rights weren't\naffected because had there been a murder indictment, there\nwas plenty of evidence to -- to convict him of murder. Is\n-- is that the position the Government's taking?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, it's not the position that\nwe're taking, Justice Scalia. And the logic of -- of the\nGovernment's position in this case doesn't have to go to a\ntotal omission of any grand jury indictment at all. Just\nas in Neder, the Court made perfectly clear that although\nharmless error analysis would apply to the omission of an\nelement, it would not apply to a directed verdict --\nQUESTION: No, but my -- my point is it seems to\nme the way you decide whether substantial rights have been\naffected is not to ask the question would he -- would he\nhave been convicted anyway. Even though he would have\nbeen convicted anyway, in some cases you simply say there\nwas no indictment. His substantial rights were affected.\nPeriod.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, there -- there is a class of\ncases in which the Court will find an effect on\nsubstantial rights without regard to the strength of the\nevidence.\nQUESTION: I don't think so.\nMR. DREEBEN: And those cases are called\nstructural error cases. And as the Court is well aware,\nthat's a very narrow category. It was hotly debated in\nthe Neder case whether structural error did apply to the\npetty jury's failure to decide an element to the offense,\nand the Court held that it was not a case of structural\nerror.\nEven the dissenting view in Neder, however,\nrecognized that when there wasn't an objection at trial\nand the case comes up on plain error review and the Court\nmight find an effect on substantial rights, it's still not\nrequired to reverse. It applies the -- the test that was\narticulated in United States v. Olano and in Johnson v.\nUnited States, was there an effect on the fairness,\nintegrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings.\nQUESTION: It seems to me that's the step that\nyou -- that you should put your -- your emphasis on in\nthis case, not the -- not the substantial right.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, that's all the Court needs\nto hold in order to conclude that the court of appeals\nerred in this case because the court of appeals in this\ncase got to the fourth step of plain error review, after\nfinding an effect on substantial rights, and then it held\nthat we really can't say what the grand jury would have\ndone. We're not permitted to speculate about that because\nthe grand jury is a body that operates without any legal\nrestrictions at all on whether it can charge or not.\nThat proposition that the grand jury is\nessentially free to charge or not, regardless of the\nevidence, is inconsistent with the historical record of\nthe way grand juries operated. The charges that were\ngiven by members of this Court sitting on circuit in the\nearly years of this Nation made clear that grand juries\nhad a duty to indict when there was probable cause to\nbelieve that an offense had been committed. And the grand\njurors' oath similarly reflected that grand jurors should\nindict when the evidence justifies that.\nQUESTION: Yes, but can I just give you sort of\nan intermediate hypothetical? Supposing all the evidence\nof quantity developed after the grand jury had returned\nits indictment that it developed, but in the plea\nbargaining they found out how much drug there really was\ninvolved, you'd treat that as the same case even though\nthe grand jury could not have indicted.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, if that case took place, as\nthis one did, in a legal regime in which the Government\ndidn't believe it had to get a grand jury indictment on\nthe point, then I suppose my answer to that is if we had\nknown, we could have gone back to the grand jury and\ngotten a superseding --\nQUESTION: No. But you didn't know the evidence\nat the time is what I'm saying.\nMR. DREEBEN: Oh, we could have gotten a\nsuperseding indictment.\nQUESTION: Oh, I see. Okay.\nMR. DREEBEN: And -- and that's what's odd about\nthis case. All parties in this case proceeded on the\ntheory that it wasn't necessary to go to the grand jury,\nand that's the explanation on this record for why there's\nnothing --\nQUESTION: Well, except that the defendant\ndoesn't have to proceed on any theory. It's your\nprosecution.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's true, but the defendant on\nthis case proceeded on the same theory as we did. The\ndefendant never objected. The defendant never believed\nthat there was a contest as to the amount of drug quantity\nin question that increased the sentence. And the result\nis that the entire sentencing proceeding unfolded with all\nparties fully well understanding that the legal regime in\nplace at the time meant that drug quantity did not have to\nbe charged in the indictment.\nAnd the proposition that a grand jury is free to\nreject the evidence of drug quantity and determine itself\nthat it just doesn't want to charge the greater offense\nwould be fundamentally at odds with the democratic system\nin this country. Congress has voted a regime in which\ndrug quantity can increase the penalties. The evidence in\nthis case established to the satisfaction of the\nGovernment that those increased quantities were there, and\ntherefore the increased penalties should be applied.\nQUESTION: Of course, if we see it your way, it\nwould be open to prosecutors all the time simply to make\nthe grand jury proceeding a short-cut and not bother to\nget into quantity and, hence, not, in -- in effect, advise\nthe -- the grand jury that it's -- that it's going for\nsomething that might have the -- the potential for life.\nAnd even in a post-Apprendi regime, I suppose you could\nsay, well, it was harmless error because the -- the\nquantity -- the -- the evidence of quantity was there and\ntherefore we -- we shouldn't regard it as structural and\nwe should overlook it.\nMR. DREEBEN: You could make that argument,\nJustice Souter, but in a post-Apprendi environment,\nApprendi is a sufficiently well-known decision of this\nCourt that no prosecutor would responsibly go to\nsentencing and say I would like to have an increased\nsentence regardless of the fact that we didn't charge drug\nquantity. And it's hard for me to imagine that there are\ndefendants or judges that wouldn't catch the error if the\nprosecutor didn't itself bring it to the attention of a\ncourt.\nQUESTION: How about in this case? If -- if the\nstandard were harmless error rather than plain error,\nwould you maintain that the Government should still\nprevail?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we would\nbecause of reasoning analogous to -- the Court used in\nNeder v. United States. The underlying values of the\nright in question are not impaired. The evidence was so\nstrong that no rational grand jury could have failed to\nfind the increased drug quantity and the defendants were\nnot deprived of notice and an opportunity to contest it.\nSo, even though there was error, the error has to be\nweighed against the important values of essentially\ndepriving society and the Government of the sentence that\nCongress prescribed for the kind of offense in question.\nAnd weighing those against each other, the conclusion\nshould be that the court of appeals should affirm rather\nthan reverse.\nQUESTION: But the Court could well conclude\notherwise were the test harmless error and you could still\nprevail.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct. And most of the\ncases that we are dealing with in this transitional era of\ndrug prosecutions that were tried before Apprendi but are\nnow on appeal after Apprendi, do not involve objections by\nthe defendant in the trial court. They are almost all\nplain error cases, and a ruling on the fourth prong of\nplain error analysis that concludes that in this scenario\nit doesn't offend the integrity and public reputation of\njudicial proceedings or their fairness to affirm rather\nthan reverse would be a outcome that would resolve almost\nall of the litigation that has occurred in this area.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I'll\nreserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Dreeben.\nMr. Sullivan, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY J. SULLIVAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to direct my first comment to the\nquestion that the Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice asked about\ndidn't the indictment and the verdict correspond. Mr.\nChief Justice, you're exactly correct. The problem is\nthat the sentence didn't correspond. And these defendants\nwere on notice for what later turned out to be a (b)(1)(C)\ndrug case that had a 20-year statutory maximum and they\nended up receiving a life sentence.\nQUESTION: I think my point was that Bain\ninvolved a situation where the verdict and the indictment\ndidn't correspond, and that a rule that says that's\njurisdictional might not extend to this situation.\nMR. SULLIVAN: The issue with jurisdictional is\ntwofold in this case. One deals with the Court's\nsentencing jurisprudence, which goes back all the way to\nIn re Bonner, which is essentially unchallenged by the\nGovernment, which sets the proposition that any excess\nsentence beyond the statutory maximum is void.\nAnd that was at the heart of Apprendi. And\nApprendi says and recognizes that a district court judge,\nlike Judge Blake in Baltimore, was limited necessarily at\nher outer limits with what's charged in the indictment and\nwhat's found by the petit jury. A district court does not\nhave a sense of roving jurisdiction under 3231. If a\ndefendant comes into that courtroom charged by the grand\njury with a specific offense, that sentence must be\nrendered for that specific offense.\nQUESTION: In re Bonner was one of those old\nhabeas cases.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, I don't\nbelieve that a -- a case that's old somehow loses its\nforce after Apprendi.\nQUESTION: Well, but I -- I think you have to\nrecognize that the Court at that time, because there was\nno direct appeal, kind of expanded the concept of\njurisdiction to reach constitutional error.\nMR. SULLIVAN: And I think that is exactly what\nthe Apprendi Court and the majority is restricting now is\n-- is that -- that exact caution of the Court. Until -- I\n-- I don't think that when a defendant goes into court and\nhas notice that he's charged -- let me just back up to say\nthis.\nThe rule of law in this case is much more\nimportant than what happens to these defendants. As\nJustice Kennedy pointed out, all we were challenging is\nthe illegal sentence in this case. We're not challenging\nthe conviction. We were convicted of a 21(b)(1)(C)\noffense. We recognize that. We recognize the court had\njurisdiction over the offense. We recognize that the\ncourt had jurisdiction over our defendants or our clients.\nWhat we challenge is the illegality of the sentence.\nQUESTION: Well, that's all, but I mean, that's\n-- that's pretty big. Your -- your clients were -- were\nconvicted, if you accept the Government's case, of being\ndrug kingpins, of running and managing a massive drug\noperation, and -- and you say all we're asking is that\nthey be given the same sentence as a mule who was just\nsomebody, you know, carrying a -- a small amount of drugs.\nI don't consider that an insignificant difference.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Justice Scalia, the burden is\nupon the Government in their prosecution to indict the\nappropriate offense. I disagree with my friend, Mr.\nDreeben, that somehow the error solely belongs to us. The\ngenesis of the error is the Government's failure to indict\ndrug quantity.\nQUESTION: Well, I think he might concede that\nyour -- you're both equally at fault, but that -- but that\ndoesn't get you all the way.\nYou began by saying that this later became a (b)\ncase, and that's the problem. It was tried on -- on a\npre-Apprendi assumptions.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Much like Neder, Justice Kennedy,\nthis case is the product of a laboratory test tube. I\nacknowledge that, and the propositions and the fundamental\nbeliefs that all of us went into the trial with are far\ndifferent because none of us could ever imagine that the\nApprendi case was forthcoming. Both Jones and Apprendi\nwere decided while this case was on direct appeal. So, I\ndon't see how we could forfeit an error that we could\nnever even imagine would -- would result in --\nQUESTION: Now, wait, wait, wait. It wasn't\nthat much of a bolt from the blue.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Nobody could imagine Apprendi?\nQUESTION: The dissenters couldn't imagine it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SULLIVAN: Justice Scalia, let me -- as a\ntrial attorney, let me just --\nQUESTION: I mean, Apprendi was -- was based on,\nI assume, the long common law tradition. There had been\nAlmandarez-Torres before. Was -- was that decided before\nthis case was tried?\nMR. SULLIVAN: I don't know the answer to that.\nQUESTION: I think it was. And -- and that case\nmade abundantly clear that there was a big problem even --\neven with respect to the proof of -- of prior offenses for\nrecidivism, in -- incremental sentences.\nSo, you know, both out of the blue? No, no, no,\nno, no.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Perhaps I overstated --\nQUESTION: No, I don't think you did.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Right.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SULLIVAN: In -- in -- my point is simple,\nJustice Scalia, is that in pre-Apprendi practice, the --\nthe Fourth Circuit made it abundantly clear to defense\nattorneys and to Government attorneys that we were not to\nconcern ourselves with sentencing factors of drug quantity\nat the time of sentencing.\nQUESTION: Did some defense attorneys make the\nobjection for the record in any case? I'm thinking back\nin the old days when there was jury discrimination and the\ncourts routinely said no, but many defense attorneys,\nknowing they were going to lose on it, made it for the\nrecord anyway, hoping that their case on appeal would be\nthe one that changed the law?\nMR. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, I'm sure there\nare attorneys who did that. That was not done in -- in\nour case. We challenged drug quantity in the typical pre-\nApprendi way under the sentencing guidelines.\nI'm reminded that in Johnson, this Court\nindicated that sometimes defense attorneys aren't expected\nto make laundry lists of objections, and I would dare\nsuggest that many of the judges that I appear in front of\nwould not be too welcoming of my trying to speculate what\nthis body would do two or three terms from now.\nSo, I don't think that -- I'm sure that there\nare attorneys throughout the country who were making these\ntypes of objections, sensing the change from McMillan and\nAlmandarez-Torres, sensing the direction of this Court,\nbut we -- we did not.\nQUESTION: That's -- I -- I'll take that as a\ngiven. I'll say, yes, it is a surprise. I couldn't\nexpect you to -- to object to all these things.\nBut in terms of recognizing plain error, where\nI'm having a problem is I don't see how you could treat\nthe grand jury any differently from the trial. That is to\nsay, if you have a trial and there is a failure to object,\nwhat we've said in our cases is it's not plain error\nunless it's very unusual circumstances.\nNow, whatever those unusual circumstances are,\nif they're present here, it should be both, and if they're\nnot present here, how could you possibly say that a person\nwho goes through a full trial and it has the defect can't\nobject, but a person who's had that defect at the grand\njury stage, but it's cured at the trial stage, could\nobject? I just don't see how a system could function that\nway.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer, my -- my answer\nis that it all goes back to the Indictment Clause of the\nFifth Amendment and to the jurisdictional end-run that\nJustice Souter was alluding to. The -- you can't guess or\nspeculate -- no court, most respectfully this Court or any\nother reviewing court, can't guess what the grand jury\nwould have, could have, or should have done.\nQUESTION: But we face many, many cases in which\nthe normal tendency of the courts has been to say, forget\nabout errors at the grand jury stage. If you're suddenly\ngoing to recognize this as an error at the grand jury\nstage, when it's cured at the trial stage, well, why\nwouldn't that throw open the doors for all kinds of\nchallenges of grand jury proceedings?\nMR. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer, Mechanik and Nova\nScotia were not -- were not constitutional rules. They\nwere procedural rules under rule 6, which had a trial that\nfollowed through and the court could -- had a record, and\nthe court could look at the record to see if the grand\njury problem affected the validity of the trial.\nQUESTION: Mr. Sullivan, I have the same problem\nthat Justice Breyer has. I didn't -- you know, I didn't\nagree with -- with Neder, but -- but given Neder, you say\nwe cannot second guess what the grand jury would have,\ncould have, should have done. But Neder says we can\nsecond guess what the petty jury would have, could have,\nshould have done. And why -- why is second guessing the\none any -- any worse than second guessing the other?\nMR. SULLIVAN: I think it goes back to the\nhistorical function of the -- the grand jury, Justice\nScalia, and the fact that what happens to the grand jury\nis absolutely --\nQUESTION: Is it any greater than the historical\nfunction of the -- of the petty jury?\nMR. SULLIVAN: The petty jury is an -- is the\nproduct of an adversarial process where a judge acts as a\nreferee and the law is well defined and the evidence is\nwell known. And the judge sits there and makes\ndeterminations. So, there's a certain sense of\nreliability to entire trial process.\nWe don't have that given the secrecy of the\ngrand jury, the fact that no matter how many times I knock\non the door to be asked to enter the grand jury, the\nGovernment will not let me or my client --\nQUESTION: But the defendant could certainly\nwaive a grand jury.\nMR. SULLIVAN: A defendant can certainly waive a\ngrand jury and proceed by information. But just if a --\nif a defendant chooses to waive the grand jury and go by\ninformation, that doesn't mean that they can be sentenced\nfor a crime that they don't waive the indictment for. So,\nfor example, if a defendant waives jurisdiction on an 841\ncase and allows to go by indictment and --\nQUESTION: What -- what do you mean when you say\nwaived jurisdiction?\nMR. SULLIVAN: I don't mean waive jurisdiction,\nYour Honor. I meant waive -- waive indictment and -- and\ngo by an information.\nYou can only be sentenced for the crime that\nyou've waived for, that you've knowingly and intelligently\nwaived for. You can't be sentenced for another crime.\nQUESTION: Well, but the idea that you can waive\na grand jury suggests that perhaps it is no -- certainly\nno higher than the -- the petty jury right. And it was\nargued, you know, when the idea of harmless of error first\nbegan to be applied, how can we possibly second guess what\na jury would have done here. Well, the answer was that in\nmany cases you can. If the evidence is overwhelming, you\ncan.\nMR. SULLIVAN: And following up on that, Mr.\nChief Justice, I don't agree that the evidence in this\ncase, despite Mr. Dreeben's articulation, was that\noverwhelming. One of the defendants in the trial court\nwere acquitted, Roger Evans. And I would suggest that now\nin a post-Apprendi practice, we would do things a lot\ndifferently attacking drug quantity that we never did when\nit was a detectable amount because no one ever had to\nworry about it.\nQUESTION: Mr. Sullivan, you -- the fact that\none defendant was acquitted I'm not sure is -- is\nrelevant. If the jury believed the testimony that was\nnecessary to support the verdict, I understand the\nGovernment to be arguing they must have been describing\ntransactions in amounts that would qualify them for the\nsentence they had. Do you disagree with that proposition?\nI thought we were sort of assuming -- if I'm\nwrong, tell me -- that it was a case in which the -- if\nyou believed the Government's evidence, as the jury did,\nyou would necessarily have -- had also believed there was\nmore than the quantity to change the -- the guidelines\nrange.\nMR. SULLIVAN: I -- well, I can't argue with\nthat. I think that's a mathematical, you know,\nformulation, but I agree that -- what I would suggest is\nthat what the Fourth Circuit said which is that the\nquantum of evidence is irrelevant when the problem stems\nfrom a defect in the indictment from the very beginning\nBut I would suggest, Justice Stevens, that now\nin the post-Apprendi environment, defense attorneys are\ntaking a much different strategy and not giving up or --\nor just resting on drug quantity or challenging drug\nquantity, challenging the laboratories, challenging the\nweights of the drugs, distancing ourselves like we would\nnormally do in conspiracy cases farther away from clients\nwho are holding heavy amounts of drugs because we now know\nthat drug quantity is -- is very important.\nQUESTION: It was an issue before the judge\nbefore, wasn't it?\nQUESTION: You had every incentive to do that\nbefore, too. I find that peculiar. I mean, surely it\nmade a difference before.\nMR. SULLIVAN: A detectable amount -- when --\nwhen you're charged with a detectable amount, it doesn't\nbehoove you, as a -- as an attorney, to challenge a\ndetectable amount. It's almost a impossible task. Any\namount is detectable.\nQUESTION: But you would before the judge. It's\njust a question now you do it before the jury, but you\nmade the same kind of attacks. It was still the\ndifference between 20 years and life.\nMR. SULLIVAN: And -- and the problem is,\nJustice Ginsburg, that under Apprendi Judge Blake -- she\nwas the wrong judge applying the wrong standard of proof.\nShe was the wrong fact finder and the wrong standard of\nproof.\nQUESTION: I guess that's your point. I guess\nthat's a fair point that there's -- there is more of an\nincentive to raise it before the jury because the jury has\nto find it beyond a reasonable doubt. And therefore, your\nchances of -- of winning a -- a contest of the amount\nbefore the jury are much better than your chances of\nwinning one before the judge.\nMR. SULLIVAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Which is what Apprendi was all about,\nI assume.\nQUESTION: But -- but if we said we want to send\nthis back so that you can have the advantage of Apprendi,\nthere's nothing the Government can do because it can't\nreindict.\nMR. SULLIVAN: The Government cannot -- I take\nthe position, Justice Kennedy, that the -- that the\nGovernment cannot reindict on double jeopardy grounds, but\nour clients would still receive 20-year sentences in the\nBureau of Prisons.\nQUESTION: I -- I understand that. But assume,\nas the courts of appeals uniformly seemed to have held,\nthat Apprendi is not retroactive to convictions that are\nfinal, and assume that the Government can protect itself\nin a post-Apprendi world. What we're talking about is\nthis narrow line of cases where you seem to have an -- an\nautomatic escape hatch and the Government can't retry.\nMR. SULLIVAN: And I find that fantastic because\nit's usually the other way around.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SULLIVAN: That -- the rule of law -- I\nmean, sometimes you -- you roll the dice and sometimes the\ndefense wins and oftentimes the Government wins, Justice\nKennedy. And perhaps the results in this case are not\npalatable to some -- to some people. But in this case --\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. -- Mr. Sullivan, in light\nof the Johnson case and the Neder case, I think the\nGovernment has a very strong argument here. I mean, you\n-- you could fail under Johnson to include an element in\nthe jury instructions and, nonetheless, conclude that it\nwas not plain error.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Judge Blake instructed the jury,\nthe petit jury, that drug quantity was not a concern of\nthe court -- I mean, concern of the jury. In Neder and\nJohnson, Justice O'Connor, again there -- there was a\ntrial. There was an adversarial process. And we don't\nknow to this very date, quite frankly, whether the grand\njury was ever asked to make a determination on drug\nquantity in the superseding indictment, and that's the\nproblem.\nIn Neder and Johnson, there was a record. There\nwas a great record that this Court could apply the\nappropriate test. You can't do that in this case, in the\nCotton case, because there is no complete record for this\nCourt to go back and basically usurp the responsibilities\nof the indictment because we don't know whether on a\ncertain date the Government brought in their witnesses to\nestablish drug quantity. We simply don't know that in\nthis case, and I think that is the fundamental difference\nthat distinguishes the line of cases of Neder and Johnson\nthat go to trial problems as opposed to indictment\nproblems.\nQUESTION: Under the first indictment, would the\njury have been instructed that it had to find the amounts?\nMR. SULLIVAN: I think in pre-Apprendi practice,\nno. I think there was -- the instruction from the judge\nthat drug quantities are not your concern would have been\nthe judge's instructions at that point.\nQUESTION: You said that some people might\ndiffer about this particular case and maybe this time it's\nroll of the dice. But the last part of the plain error\ntest is just that. Is this something that's fundamentally\nunfair that will affect the reputation of the courts? And\nit seems to me that what you just told us goes against any\nsuch finding.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, I had -- the\nOlano test is quite clear that you don't -- well, that a\ndecision on a basic right that is forfeited doesn't matter\non -- if somebody is innocent or guilty. It's much\nstronger and much more important than that.\nI do suggest, most respectfully, that the\nintegrity of the court under the fourth Olano prong would\nbe impaired if the -- the decision is that you can be\nindicted for one offense and convicted for another\noffense, that that's why the fairness and the integrity of\nthe judicial proceedings comes into question. The very\nintegrity of the court, the power of the court to do the\nmost -- one of the most important things to a person who's\ncharged with a crime -- oftentimes people don't care what\nthey're charged with.\nQUESTION: In -- in a transition case, in -- in\na case where the -- the law was -- was in flux, this would\nnot be a determination -- a plain error determination\nwouldn't be that routinely this kind of omission could\noccur.\nMR. SULLIVAN: I think this is the exception\nrather than the rule. That's correct.\nQUESTION: I thought that the -- the lack of\nconformity between the indictment and the conviction is\nnot in this case. You said --\nMR. SULLIVAN: No. It's --\nQUESTION: -- you can be indicted for one\noffense and convicted of another. That's -- that's not in\nthis case, is it? It's just a question of whether the\ngrand jury decided upon what was in the indictment.\nMR. SULLIVAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: What was the defense?\nMR. SULLIVAN: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: What was the defense at trial?\nMR. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer, in this multi-\ndefendant 846 conspiracy, the defense was one part that\nthe Government cooperators lacked credibility, that they\nweren't reliable. It was one part attacking the Baltimore\nCity Police Department. This is what we call a historical\ncase. It was a series of arrests that the Government put\ntogether at the end and made it into a conspiracy.\nQUESTION: I mean, was it basically they didn't\ndo it?\nMR. SULLIVAN: It was that and there was also\nmultiple conspiracies. The judge instructed the jury on\nmultiple --\nQUESTION: I just wonder on the harmless part or\nwhether it's harmful. If they were arguing, well, we\ndidn't do it, is it likely that they would have presented\nto the jury evidence that even though we didn't do it, the\namount involved was only 500 grams or less and not more?\nMR. SULLIVAN: I -- I don't think that that --\nthat that would have been -- you never use drug quantities\nas a defense.\nQUESTION: All right. So, that's -- that -- you\nsee the reason -- the reason that I say that is because\nthey're saying, look, this error is harmless, and part of\nthe strength of your claim I think is that they never\ncould have thought of it at the trial before Apprendi to\nraise it.\nBut if it is harmless and you're really arguing\nfor us to make an exception from Neder, as well as the\ngrand jury, I wonder if there's any response to the view I\njust stated. I mean, that it was harmless.\nMR. SULLIVAN: I don't think it can be harmless,\nJustice Breyer, because the very thrust of Neder, the very\nthrust of harmless error analysis is the Government must\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error didn't\naffect substantial rights. And I don't know how the\nGovernment could make that burden of proof in this case --\nQUESTION: Well, in Neder, didn't the Court\nassume that substantial rights were affected?\nMR. SULLIVAN: I think -- I think --\nQUESTION: I think in either Neder or Johnson,\nit did. I forget which one it is.\nAnd then -- so they went to the fourth prong and\nsaid, you know, even assuming substantial rights are\naffected, you know, this -- this is not going to reflect\non the integrity of the -- the court system or whatever\nthe fourth prong reads.\nMR. SULLIVAN: That -- I think you're obviously\ncorrect, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think the important\nthing too about Neder is that the Court was -- was\nconvinced -- I think part of its position was that the\ncorrect standard of proof that the district judge on the\nmateriality element found it by -- beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. So, I think that we don't have a problem with a\nmishmash of different standards of proof like we do in\nthis case here where -- where some elements of the\nindictment are found beyond a reasonable doubt and some\nelements are found by a preponderance of the evidence and\nyou have different fact finders performing -- performing\ndifferent functions.\nQUESTION: What I was trying to direct your\nattention to, which is -- and maybe this doesn't help you.\nBut I thought that Neder -- and I'd have to reread it to\nbe sure -- was saying the omission of an element doesn't\nalways automatically mean no clear error, but it might\nsometimes. And so, I guess if it might sometimes, maybe\nthis is one of those unusual cases or exceptional cases\nwhere it would. But if so, your clients must have been\ntreated very fairly -- unfairly and the criminal justice\nsystem must have suffered in its reputation. Now, you\nmight have something to say on that point, and I wanted to\nbe sure you did if you do.\nMR. SULLIVAN: And my point is, Justice Breyer,\nthat I agree with the premise of your question and my\nanswer would be that Neder and that harmless error rule\nenunciated there would be utterly meaningless in this case\nbecause there's no object and no gap that any reviewing\ncourt could fill because we don't know and we will never\nknow what happened in front of the grand jury when that\nelement was not returned.\nAnd it's precisely that no object to scrutinize\nfor harmless, which you'll never have in a trial for the\nmost part because of the adversarial process, because of\nthe judge refereeing what goes on -- there's a reliability\nfactor there. There's not that reliability factor before\nthe grand jury.\nQUESTION: Well, but if you're right in that,\nthen Mechanik was wrongly decided.\nMR. SULLIVAN: I -- I don't believe that\nMechanik was wrongly decided, Mr. Chief Justice. Mechanik\nwas not a constitutional issue. It was -- it was a --\nmore of a procedural issue --\nQUESTION: But it said that, you know, you can't\nattack the indictment rendered by the grand jury even\nthough you might have some -- some reason to do so.\nMR. SULLIVAN: That's correct, but there was\nnever a challenge to the validity of the indictment -- the\nindictment itself in Mechanik, which is the root of our\ncontention here. The Mechanik indictment was concededly\nfree of error. I think that's what the Court -- what the\nCourt found to be a very important distinction. And that\n-- we don't have that in this case. The indictment is the\ncause of -- of our problems in this case. So, I think\nMechanik is -- is distinguishable, and the Court did apply\nharmless error in Mechanik but found that it didn't rise\nto the level to -- to challenge the structural integrity\nof -- of the grand jury process itself.\nQUESTION: May I go back to your argument that\nyou made a second ago that we never know what the grand\njury would have done if it had been presented with the\nevidence? The difficulty that I have with that argument\nis, number one, I think we have a pretty clear body of law\nthat tells the grand jury what its duty is, if it is\npresented with evidence which would justify an indictment\nwith respect to quantity and hence the severity of the\ncrime.\nAnd if we're going to respect that law on duty,\nthen in order to see it your way, we have to say, well,\nregardless of what the grand jury's duty is and regardless\nof what the probability is that it would indict and -- and\nwould specify the quantity, we have to assume that there's\na wild card element in the grand jury. And on the basis\nof that wild card element, you never absolutely know what\nthey're going to do. We are -- we are going to hold that,\nin fact, you can never assess the harmfulness of the\nerror.\nHow do we get to the point of dispensing with\nour law on grand jury duty and emphasizing the wild card\nelement, in effect, of the grand jury when it refuses to\nfollow that obligation? How -- how are we able to do\nthat?\nMR. SULLIVAN: Justice Souter, I think the\nanswer is that we try to remain as true as we can to the\nFramers' intent and the Framers' fear of a corrupt\njudiciary or an oppressive prosecutor. And that bulk --\nthat bulk word or whatever -- whatever that barrier that\nexists between the process, that very threshold that\nbrings someone into the criminal justice system that that\ncannot be -- that is indispensable to our system.\nQUESTION: Well, wasn't that a fear --\nQUESTION: Go ahead.\nQUESTION: Wasn't -- wasn't that a fear, in\neffect, that grand juries are simply going to be puppets\nthat are going to be indicting without regard to evidence?\nWhereas, here the assumption is the evidence is\noverwhelming, and so that policy of wanting the grand jury\nto stand between the state and the individual is not\nreally a policy that's implicated here.\nMR. SULLIVAN: I -- you're right in that regard,\nJustice Souter, but we don't know if the Government did\nits duty and presented to this grand jury drug quantities\nin the superseding indictment. So, we don't even know,\nbased on any record that we can discern, whether or not\nthat major element, that critical element that -- that\ndrives the sentences in this case was ever presented to\nthem. So, sure, I guess that, you know, grand juries can\ncharge greater offenses of it. And that's one of the\nbeauties of it. They can charge greater offenses, lesser\nsentence, no -- no -- I mean, not -- offenses, or none at\nall, and they can even nullify, although it's not -- we --\nwe shouldn't encourage it.\nQUESTION: But they tend not to nullify, I\nthink, except when there are political considerations that\nthe grand jury sort of smells in the circumstances. And\none thing it seems to me clear is that the grand juries\nare not likely to smell political considerations when the\nGovernment decides to go after kingpins as opposed to when\nthe Government decides to go after mules. And so, I -- I\ndon't see that concern as coming to the fore in this case.\nMR. SULLIVAN: And I -- and I guess it goes\nback, Justice Souter, to where I began this morning. It's\nthe Government's responsibility to indict each defendant\nbased on their roles and their culpability. You can't go\nin and just do a blanket 846 indictment. You must\ndelineate each and every element of each and every offense\nfor each and every defendant. And that's the Government's\nfailure in this case.\nLook, I -- I understand the fact that it's not\nterribly difficult for the Government to obtain a Federal\ngrand jury indictment. I mean, I -- it's very rare that\nthey -- a Federal grand jury will no-bill what the U.S.\nAttorney wants him or her to do or them to do. There is a\ntension there.\nBut I think the rule of law and the purpose of\nthe grand jury and why we need the grand jury is far\ngreater than whether or not Mr. Hall, the leader of this\ndrug conspiracy, is going to do life or 20 years or by\nwhether other people who may have had different roles in\nthe conspiracy which no drug quantity has ever been\nattributed to them -- there's evidence that they have been\ninvolved in multiple conspiracies. Whether they're mules\nor couriers or street vendors or kingpins, sometimes the\nrule of law requires that -- that fairness be done. And\n-- and fairness in this case is a sentence based on what\nyou were charged with, not a sentence based on something\nthat you weren't charged with.\nQUESTION: I think you -- I think you've got a\ngood argument there except for the fact that we've got to\nfind a distinction between the role of the grand juries\nand the petty grand juries given the fact that Neder is --\nis on the record. And that's -- that's why I was fishing\nfor something and kind of shooting down everything that I\ncould come up with. And that's the dilemma I have.\nMR. SULLIVAN: The dilemma is, Justice Souter --\nis that what -- this would crack open the gate to allow, I\nwould suggest, the Government to trample into the -- the\ngrand jury function. They already go into the grand jury\nroom each and every day, but now they can indict for one\nthing, prove another thing, if their position is adopted\nhere, charge one thing --\nQUESTION: But that didn't happen here. They\ndidn't indict for one thing and prove another thing. You\nagreed --\nMR. SULLIVAN: But --\nQUESTION: -- the -- the verdict corresponded to\nthe indictment.\nMR. SULLIVAN: No. I'm talking in a different\ncase, a more broader case, not this actual case.\nQUESTION: Well, wait. You don't -- you don't\nagree that the verdict corresponded to the indictment, do\nyou? I -- I thought the only reason that that issue was\nnot in this case is because of Neder.
