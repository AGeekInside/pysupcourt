        "content": "(11:10 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in United Haulers Association versus\nOneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority.\nMr. Tager.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EVAN TAGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. TAGER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe barriers to interstate commerce imposed\nby the flow control ordinances in this case are even\nmore severe than those resulting from the ordinance this\nCourt struck down in Carbone. As in Carbone, no local\nwaste can leave the counties for processing. In\naddition, now that Respondent's landfill is up and\nrunning no local waste can leave the counties for\ndisposal either. The issue here is whether Carbone is\ninapplicable to this outright embargo merely because\nRespondent's own the facilities to which the haulers are\nrequired to bring the waste. The answer is no, and the\nreason is that the concerns underlying the Commerce\nClause are implicated whether interstate commerce was\nbeing obstructed for the benefit of a public enterprise\nor a private one.\nThe whole point of the Commerce Clause was\nto promote the national economy and to put an end to\nparochial barriers to interstate trade. This Court has\nconsistently held that embargoes, local processing\nrequirements, and other barriers to interstate commerce\nviolate the Commerce Clause because such laws inevitably\nprompt resentment, retaliation, and ultimately --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I guess in many thousands\nof municipalities throughout the United States it's\nfairly common to have a locally owned electricity\ndistribution company, or an electrically -- or a gas\ndistribution company. And I thought it was fairly\ncommon for a municipally owned pipeline, gas pipeline,\nor electricity distribution to say, if you live in our\ntown you've got to buy from us; you've got to buy from\nthe local community. And I guess that's been going on\nfor about 110 years.\nAnd yet I've never seen anybody think or\nwrite or anything that that violated the Commerce\nClause. But of course, there could be somebody in\nanother State who'd like to sell electricity to the\npeople in our town. They can't do it because the town\nsays, we own the company and you got to buy from us.\nNow, if we agree with you are we saying that\nall those gas companies, distribution companies, et\ncetera, are behaving unconstitutionally?\nMR. TAGER: The first point of clarification\non that is the question -- the question is does strict\nscrutiny apply.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not interested in\ntests. I'm interested in just the outcome. I just\nraise the question.\nMR. TAGER: Yes. I am not, I am not sure\nthat it's correct that in all of those municipalities\nyou hypothesize that they are actually pairing their\nprovision of local --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I used to teach the\nsubject and I can't say you're wrong. But I knew that\nit was a fairly common thing to have a certification\nthat gave you a -- as a company, it would give them a\nlocal area in which they had an exclusive monopoly. And\nthat was common and it was called a service area, and in\nthe local town, the service area, I never even heard of\na company trying to come in and sell from abroad,\nbecause I thought that this certificate gave them an\nexclusive right to provide the local electricity service\nor the natural gas service. I mean, it's a fairly\nobvious thing. And I might be wrong and I mention that\nmy memory -- I've never focused directly on it. Just\neverybody I read and everything I read, I assumed the\nconstitutionality of this. But of course, memory is\nfallible, including mine. Therefore, I raise the\nquestion.\nMR. TAGER: Well, if the utility is -- if\nthe utility is privately owned --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I'm not talking\nabout that because I guess that would be trying to\nattack Carbone. Far be it from me.\nBut I know at least there are these things\ncalled municipal gas utilities and municipal electricity\ncompanies; and during the New Deal that was thought to\nbe quite a good thing, and that's years ago. In all\nthat time when people were attacking New Deal agencies,\nI've never seen an attack based on this ground.\nMR. TAGER: Well, I think that the same\nlogic would apply as in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, I think it would.\nThe same logic would apply.\nMR. TAGER: And it would apply to all of the\ncases this Court has ever held. In every single case\ninvolving an embargo or a local processing requirement\nor a local needs requirement, if you just substitute \"in\npublic ownership\" you'd have the exact same case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the fact is there is\na difference between public ownership and giving an\nexclusive franchise to a public company. And the public\nownership means that the people of the State have\ndecided to have their own little nationalized industry,\nwhich again people don't like, many. But I never knew\nthere was anything in the Constitution that forbid it.\nMR. TAGER: Well, I think that the whole\npoint of the Commerce Clause was to stop these kind of\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Nationalized industries?\nMR. TAGER: Well, to stop the idea that\neverything can be localized.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you don't\neven have to get into the theory. What happens in a lot\nof municipalities of course is that they decide, well,\nwe're going to run the waste treatment facility and\nwe're going to tax the people in the municipality to\nsupport it and the service is going to be free. Now, is\nthat a violation of the Commerce Clause?\nMR. TAGER: If they're only providing it for\nfree and not barring you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. TAGER: -- from engaging in interstate\ncommerce, in the event, for example, that you found\nthere to be some additional benefit from engaging in an\ninterstate transaction, I think we would have -- the\nCommerce Clause would be implicated. But as a practical\nmatter, they would be able to accomplish much the same\nthing because most people would take the free service.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't understand.\nYou know, as far as the impact on out of State\ncompetitors are concerned, it's exactly the same. The\nState or the municipality runs its own waste disposal\nfacility. There is no charge for dumping the waste\nthere. The cost of it is entirely covered by taxes.\nOkay.\nNow, the people you're representing, out of\nstate people who would provide dumping grounds for this\nwaste, they would charge 9 dollars a ton or whatever\nthey would charge. It would be more than what the\nmunicipality is charging.\nNow, why isn't that a restraint on\ninterstate commerce, discrimination against interstate\ncommerce?\nMR. TAGER: Well, it's market participation\nif all they're doing is public collection and bringing\nit --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I'm sorry. You have to\ndump your waste in the municipal garbage dump.\nMR. TAGER: If you parrot the Flow Control\nordinance I think it's exactly the same.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, so that's fair. Even\nif they support it entirely by taxes?\nMR. TAGER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So that they're not\ncompeting in the marketplace in any way, they're not\ngetting any money from the people who are dumping\ngarbage. They get money from the whole tax base.\nMR. TAGER: The impact on the interstate\nmarket is the same, and I think that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, it is indeed.\nMR. TAGER: -- the Court's Commerce\nClause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't think you'd be\nwilling to go that far, but you'd say that that violates\nthe Commerce Clause.\nMR. TAGER: But I don't think I -- let me be\nclear. We don't need to win that case in order to win\nthis case, because in this case --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not so sure.\nMR. TAGER: This case is almost on all fours\nwith Carbone. All you've done is transfer the\nownership. As you know, in Carbone that facility was\ndestined to be owned within less than 2 years from the\ntime the Court issued its opinion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in the majority\nopinion, as opposed to the dissent, at least as I read\nit, on almost every page it uses words like \"local\noperator,\" \"local enterprise,\" \"local proprietor,\"\n\"local business,\" doesn't speak, as the dissent did,\nabout a municipal facility. It seems great care was\ntaken in the majority to not characterize that transfer\npledge as a municipal facility.\nMR. TAGER: Well, two responses to that,\nJustice Ginsburg. First, there were other references\nwhere the opinion said \"the town's facility.\" Indeed,\nthe Flow Control witness himself referred to it as the\ntown's facility.\nAnd the other response is, to call someone a\nproprietor doesn't mean that they're private. In this\ncase, they're charging $81 -- or $86 a ton. Every ton\nthat comes in, they make more money.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm sorry. At least as I\nread the Carbone opinion, it didn't deal with the\npublic-private distinction. It seemed to assume it was\na private entrepreneur. And it didn't take a position\none way or another whether there would be a distinction.\nMR. TAGER: Well, I don't think the Court\naffirmatively decided the issue. I think the\ndistinction didn't matter to the majority. I think the\nmajority is focusing on the consequences of putting up\nbarriers to interstate commerce, of putting up embargoes\nand local processing requirements. And you could take\nalmost any one of the Court's cases and just substitute\nin public ownership. Take, for example --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But not -- you know, you\nhave a whole string of commercial products, but you have\nrecognized, too, that garbage disposal has for long been\nconsidered a municipal responsibility, a municipal\nfunction.\nAnd you also say that the total, the -- what\nis it -- cradle to grave, if the county took over all of\nthe garbage disposal business, the hauling from the\ngarbage generator to the plant, and then there wouldn't\nbe any commerce problem, right? But if it does\nsomething less, there is?\nMR. TAGER: Well, there were two questions\nembedded there. Let me see if I can take them in order.\nThe idea that it is a traditional local function, I\ndon't think can support any kind of meaningful test in\nthis case. The Court has rejected that very - that very\nstandard in Garcia and the Tenth Amendment cases, and\nprior to that in the intergovernmental tax immunity\ncases, and the reason it did so is it found that it was\nunworkable to try to determine what is a traditional\ngovernment function in any particular case. The Court\nfound that it was in a total line-drawing morass. And\nso it said we're throwing that out.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, there is still at\nleast the obvious distinction, that one of the main\npurposes of the dormant Commerce Clause is to prevent\nprotectionism. Protectionism is when a state favors its\nown producers. And you could see, indeed a big argument\nin Carbone was, you aren't favoring your own producer;\nwell, we are at least favoring one. But now where the\nmunicipality is running it itself, no one is favored.\nSo I don't think it was an object of the\nCommerce Clause to prevent a State from favoring its own\ngovernment.\nMR. TAGER: I don't know whether the framers\nconsidered it but I do know --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it's about --\nMR. TAGER: -- protectionism wasn't the only\nthing that they were concerned about.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, is there something\nhere that is not protection? Because Carbone was still\nperhaps viewing it most favorably, an extreme case of\nprotection, only one individual was protected.\nMR. TAGER: No. First of all, what was\nbeing protected was this plan. The town had to fund its\ntransfer station, a transfer station that it was going\nto take possession of less than two years after this\nCourt decided the case.\nSo the protectionism that was going on there\nwas really protection of their investment in their\nscheme.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it was also\nprotectionism -- I mean, I didn't agree with this at the\ntime, but I mean there, it -- you have to admit that\nthere was protectionism of the one licensee, the person\nwho constructed the plant and was going to sell it to\nthe town for a dollar. That, so far as we know, that\nperson or that company was in it for the money.\nAnd so for the period of the five years\nprior to the transfer to the town for the dollar, that\nparticular entity was being protected so it could make\nmoney, and therefore, make it worthwhile for that\ncompany to sell its, its real estate to the town for a\ndollar. Surely that entity was being protected\nhandsomely.\nMR. TAGER: But it would be equally\nprotected, Your Honor, if the government owned the\nfacility but said you keep all the tipping fees until\nit's paid off and take a nice profit on top, too.\nThis distinction --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's -- that's a\nthird case but that's not the question we have here, is\nit?\nMR. TAGER: Well, the case you have here is\nare you going to adopt a new formalistic particular\ndistinction between public and private ownership, when\nin the past this Court has concluded that a lot of these\nother distinctions were unworkable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, so, you say\nformalistic as if it's a bad thing. But the, the\ndistinction, say in the First Amendment, if the private\ncontractor the day before the municipality bought the\nfacility for a dollar had fired an employee because of\nhis or her political views, you wouldn't argue that that\nis state action just because the next day it was going\nto be controlled by the public entity. And yet the next\nday, that type of action would be subject to First\nAmendment scrutiny. It may be a formalistic distinction\nbut in many areas of the law it makes all the\ndifference.\nMR. TAGER: Well, I just think you are going\nto be walking into so many line-drawing problems because\nif that example is one, are you going to require 100\npercent public ownership, or a majority interest, 50-50?\nOnce you go down this road, I think it is just opening\nup a huge can of worms when the focus ought to be what\nis the impact on interstate commerce? What we have here\nnow that the landfill is up and running is an absolute\nembargo. No waste generated in this town, in these\ncounties, excuse me, can leave the State, period, end of\nstory.\nIt is no different, in effect, it is no less\nlikely to breed resentment and retaliation than --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is kind of\nformalistic on the other side because you, I thought you\nagreed that if the municipality did it through tax\nrevenues and there was no formal flow restriction and\nyet it only made sense to dump your waste at the free\nfacility, you seem to suggest that would be okay.\nMR. TAGER: Well, I'm glad you reminded me\nof that point. I meant to make it earlier. In West\nLynn Creamery this Court said that these kind of things\nmake a difference. There are certain ways you do things\nand certain ways you can't do things. If you place an\nembargo, that's traditionally been regarded as subject\nto strict scrutiny. If you try to do the same thing by\nmaking it free and providing public -- public -- public\ncollection, that's okay.\nAnd -- and what the Court cases say is do it\nthe right way and we'll worry about the consequences\nlater.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Here, I take it the reason\nthey want to do this is because they wanted their\nmunicipal facility to charge a higher price for the\nnon-recyclable rubbish and that will encourage people to\nsegregate the rubbish and thereby have more cyclable --\nrecyclable rubbish, and therefore overall pay less.\nAnd that's why they want to do it, and of\ncourse that's not going to work. If somebody comes in\nfrom out of State and charges a lower price for all of\nthe non-recyclable rubbish or you know, for all rubbish,\nit just won't work. It is rather like electricity,\ninterestingly enough, where municipalities would do the\nsame thing. They want discriminatory rates in order to\npush out the possibility of poorer people getting\nelectricity. This they want to do the same thing but\nthey want to do it for rubbish, for, to encourage\nrecycling.\nMR. TAGER: Several answers to that,\nJustice Breyer.\nOne, the same argument was made in Carbone.\nIt doesn't matter who owns the facility.\nTwo, this is an argument about why they\nmight survive strict scrutiny, it's not a -- I know you\ndon't like hearing about that -- but the question here\nis do we apply strict scrutiny or not. And that goes to\nthe strength of their interest. And then of course the\nquestion turns on, can it be met in nondiscriminatory\nways? The answer is \"very well.\" Since Carbone was\ndecided, the municipalities have been living with no\nflow control, virtually every one in the country, yet\nrecycling has gone up in the, in that intervening\nperiod.\nIndeed the best way to accomplish recycling\nis to charge volume-based fees to, to the -- between the\nhaulers and the, and the generators. That's not what is\ngoing on here. They're just charging it at the disposal\npoint. So there are plenty of communities all -- excuse\nme -- plenty of communities all over the country that\nare charging what's known as a batch fee where you pay\nfor each -- you pay -- you get a label, like you put on\na bag; you can't dispose of the bag without the label,\nthe label costs a certain amount of money. None of\nthese people have flow -- none of these communities have\nflow control but there's a direct straightforward way.\nThey can also impose regulations directly on\nthe generators and directly on the haulers to make sure\nthey're doing these things. So it is hardly a reason\nfor creating a brand-new public-private distinction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It sounds to me as though,\nif we accept your argument that, going back to\nJustice Breyer's first question, every municipal utility\nin the United States is going to fall.\nMR. TAGER: Well -- I'm not an expert on --\non that industry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you know, you know\nthat there are plenty of, of communities that don't have\nmunicipal utilities and seem to get natural gas. They\nseem to get electricity. The lights go on. And\ntherefore by parity of reasoning to what we have just\nheard, there just wouldn't be the justification for,\nlet's say, embargoing the importation of electricity and\ngas by private entities from outside.\nSo that if you win on this argument, no more\nmunicipal lifelines.\nMR. TAGER: I didn't hear the last part.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No more municipal\npipelines.\nMR. TAGER: Well, I think they can have the\nplant. They just -- assuming that is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they'd like to run\nthem as --\nMR. TAGER: They'd like to have a monopoly,\nand --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- an exclusive monopoly,\nand in that sense they won't, they won't be around\nanymore because the Commerce Clause will, will declare\nthem unconstitutional.\nMR. TAGER: Well, but that's excluding that\n-- as I understand it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You would say that they can\ndo it so long as they charge less than out of State\npeople --\nMR. TAGER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and therefore people buy\ntheir services because they're cheaper. So long as they\ndon't prohibit the importation, if they run the\nmunicipal facility on tax revenues, and therefore charge\nvery little for the electricity or whatever they're\nproviding, that's perfectly okay for you. Right?\nMR. TAGER: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So long as they don't\nprohibit anybody from out of State.\nMR. TAGER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then where does your\nargument about formalism go? Isn't it a formalistic\ndistinction whether the utility does its financing\nthrough or its collection through taxes, or through a\nuser fee?\nYou said, you said distinctions on -- I\nthought you said distinctions like that were purely\nformalistic --\nMR. TAGER: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- for purposes of the\nCommerce Clause, and therefore the distinction I suppose\nwouldn't count.\nMR. TAGER: Well, I think what I was talking\nabout, the public-private distinction, it is different\nin kind from saying there are certain kinds of conduct,\nsome kinds of Government conduct that are permissible\nlike a subsidy, for example, take your South-Central\nTimber versus Wunnicke case. The Court said in that\nopinion you can't impose contractually on the people who\nbuy the timber the obligation to process it in the\nState; but what you can do is you can subsidize it, so\nthey can't want to do it. So this is something that has\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There's some, then I guess\nyou are saying some formalistic distinctions, some\ndistinctions that don't make any difference economically\nbut are formalistically different are okay.\nMR. TAGER: Well, I'm not sure that one is\ncompletely formalistic. The Court said there, that\ngives people a choice. They can still take it out of\nthe State if they want to, and they may have good reason\nto.\nGoing back to the trash argument, the trash\nexample, you could provide it for free; but a consumer\nmight say, you know what, I'd like to have more days of\npickup than you're providing me. Or I think their\ntrucks of this private company are a lot nicer; I'd\nrather have a van stopping in front of my house than\nyour beaten up municipal truck. So a case like Wunnicke\nestablishes that that's the way it works. That it's\nokay to have alternatives. What you can't have is\nforcing people to do this through regulation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- is there a\ndistinction between the question Justice Breyer put to\nyou, the hypothetical of a municipal electricity\ncompany, and this case? In this case you have private\nhaulers, you have private waste dumps at the end, you\njust have a public, a publicly owned and mandated\nprocessing center in the middle.\nIt would be as if in the electric case you\nhave private electric companies that generate the power,\nprivate electric companies that distribute the power,\nbut they all have to go through a Government-owned\ntransformer at the key. It seems that's the case you\nhave here.\nMR. TAGER: Yes. That's why --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you don't make that,\nthat's not the argument you make.\nMR. TAGER: Well, I would --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: At least that's not the\nway you answered Justice Breyer.\nMR. TAGER: I like your answer better, Your\nHonor.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. TAGER: But what, what I was trying to\nget back to was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Like it --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But, but then, but then\nJustice Breyer is going to say well, you --\nMR. TAGER: He'd changed the hypo.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that you, that you can\nbar it altogether but you can't regulate it just a\nlittle bit --\nMR. TAGER: You can --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- actually is greater\nthan the sum of it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I actually point out that\nCalifornia, I think, wants to own the grid and privatize\nthe rest of it. And there are -- I mean, it --\nJustice Kennedy is totally right. There are all kinds\nof combinations and permutations. There, there could be\ndistributors who are in fact regulated private companies\nand local distributors who are owned by the city, and I\nguess there, there is one generator, at least, company\nthat's owned by the -- that's a -- TV -- with TVA.\nThey, they make their own.\nSo there are all kinds of permutations and\ncombinations. And I think we're getting at, when we\ntake that aspect of the permutation and combination and\nsay that aspect of it which is owned by a Government\nsays: \"Our way or the highway.\" You know, that's what\nthey say. \"Buy from us.\" Period.\nAnd if you're in a certain region, I've\nalways thought they could do that. And I have to admit\nI never really looked it up; I've just never came across\na case that says to the contrary.\nMR. TAGER: I, I haven't seen a case either\nway. It's my, my way of seeing this case law is that\nthere's -- that the rule is simple: if you are doing\nsomething to interfere with the free flow of interstate\ncommerce, you're subject to strict scrutiny. And maybe\nin that situation, maybe it survives strict scrutiny. I\ndon't know that they would in this day and age, when\ngetting, getting gas or other kinds of power to a\ncommercial establishment, for example, is not very\ndifficult and would not necessarily tear up the\ninfrastructure, or whatever. I think they might --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What I guess we really\ndon't know is whether Justice Breyer's parade of\nhorribles are cases in which the municipality was able\nto provide the service more cheaply if it subsidized it,\nin which case there's no burden on commerce, or were\nthey accompanied by prohibitions against competition, as\nJustice Scalia pointed out. I don't know.\nMR. TAGER: I think it's hypothetical.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a quite different\nassumption.\nMR. TAGER: I think his hypothetical assumed\na ban. But I certainly agree with you, Justice Stevens,\nthat if they do it simply by competing, then that's\nperfectly acceptable.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what is your\nauthority for the proposition that we use strict\nscrutiny?\nMR. TAGER: I draw it from the entire line\nof cases, from the local processing cases, the embargo\ncases, the local --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me one case\nof it being strict scrutiny?\nMR. TAGER: For?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, I just didn't\nrealize that that phrase entered into our Commerce\nClause jurisprudence. Correct me if I'm wrong.\nMR. TAGER: Well, I was using it as a\nsynonym for the \"virtually per se unconstitutional\"\nrule.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That is to say, if it\ndiscriminates?\nMR. TAGER: If it discriminates, or some of\nthe earlier cases didn't use the term --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But certainly on burden\ncases we don't require that.\nMR. TAGER: Well, not the burden that we\ntalk about in the price context. But in the earlier\ncases they referred, cases like Minnesota versus Barber\nand some of the other, earlier cases, refer to it as\nbeing burdens on commerce, but clearly what they meant\nwas there are certain kinds of regulations, and I think\nit's easier to just categorize them, embargoes, local\nneeds requirements, local processing requirements,\nthings likes that, which basically so obstruct\ninterstate commerce as to require the virtual per se\nrule.\nIndeed, Pike itself has that very statement.\nThat's sort of the classic case in which you invoke that\nhigh level of scrutiny.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I'd\nlike to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Cahill.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. CAHILL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. CAHILL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nNo decision of this Court has held that\npublic service is comparable to private enterprise for\npurposes of dormant Commerce Clause analysis. Here the\nonly entity that benefits from these laws is the\ngovernment itself.\nJUSTICE ALITO: All the local processing\ncases, would they have come other differently if those\nfacilities -- the milk processing plant, the shrimp\nprocessing plant, and so forth -- had been publicly\nowned?\nMR. CAHILL: I think, Your Honor, they would\nbe different. In each of those cases the laws in\nquestion operated to protect a private entity or group\nof entities. In Dean Mills, for instance, it was a\ngroup of private milk pasteurizers within a five-mile\nradius of the town -- the city of Madison. In none of\nthose cases was the government itself engaged in\nproviding the service to the public.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it might be a good\nrevenue device for the government to say, yeah, let's\nhave our own pasteurizing plant, we'll make it a\ncriminal offense for anybody to use a facility other\nthan ours and we'll charge triple the price.\nMR. CAHILL: Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's not a burden on\ninterstate commerce?\nMR. CAHILL: That might be. In our case\nthat is not the case here. What we use is a user fee.\nWe have a limit. There's a limit to a user fee. We can\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the user fee were\nten times what it is?\nMR. CAHILL: We can only charge something\nthat's reasonably related to the cost of what, of the\nservice that we provide.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why is that?\nMR. CAHILL: In Evansville Airport, Your\nHonor, this Court held that -- versus Delta Airlines --\nthat a user fee is constitutionally limited; there has\nto be a relationship between the cost of a service and\nthe amount that's charged.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So don't call it a user\nfee. Call it something else.\nMR. CAHILL: Your Honor, if we --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Call it a tax ripoff.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then you can charge\nwhatever you want, so long as you don't call it a user\nfee, right?\nMR. CAHILL: In New York, Your Honor, you\neither have to call it a user fee or a tax or something\nelse.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Call it a cable TV\nfranchise fee. I mean, isn't that the way\nmunicipalities used to make a lot of money? They\ncharged outrageous amounts to give the cable franchise\nand then grant a monopoly in exchange.\nMR. CAHILL: I don't know what cable\nfranchises base their, base their amounts on. I do know\nthat in our case the cost to tip a ton of waste is\ndirectly related to the value of the services that we\nprovide to the public.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To get back to the\npublic-private distinction, what is the answer to\nMr. Tager's point that that's difficult to -- what if\nyou have a 50 percent publicly owned, 50 percent\nprivately owned company? Is that covered by the\nCommerce Clause cases or not?\nMR. CAHILL: Your Honor, I think that the --\nthey would not be -- it would not be unconstitutional\nunder the Commerce Clause cases. I think that the\ndistinction is that when government is actually in the\ntransaction, when it's taking the risks, when it's\nspending public money, when it's providing a service\ndirectly to the people, it's a public, it's a public\nservice.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But at the same -- exactly\nthat -- that avoids the problem. At exactly the same\ntime, it's protecting the private 50 percent interest.\nWhy isn't the better answer that in fact that would be\nsubject to Commerce Clause analysis and that would fall,\nthat if the government wants to do this the government's\ngoing to do it the way the government's doing it in your\ncase, it's going to be a 100 percent government. If it\ndoesn't, it's protectionism.\nMR. CAHILL: Your Honor, I agree with you.\nWe don't have 50 percent ownership. We don't have any\nprivate ownership anywhere. There are, however,\ngovernment agencies in other contexts where there is a\nprivate partner. That's a case that isn't here today.\nBut the question was what if there was, and I don't\nthink the answer is automatic one way or the other.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know, there's a general\nagreement throughout the world nowadays that sovereign\nimmunity, which usually applies to governments, doesn't\napply when the government is engaged in a commercial\nactivity. Now, why shouldn't something similar apply to\ngovernment regulation which ends up discriminating\nagainst out of State businesses, when the government is\nengaging in a commercial activity it is subject to the\nrestrictions of the Commerce Clause? Why isn't that a\nreasonable rule?\nMR. CAHILL: I think it is a reasonable\nrule. But I don't think that we're engaging in\ncommercial activity in this particular case. If we were\nto offer our services to citizens to whom we do not have\na governmental responsibility, then I think we're\nentering into the realm of competition with the private\nsector.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose any\nprivate entity can choose its market.\nMR. CAHILL: Pardon me, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose any private\nentity can choose its market. You're a market\nparticipant. You're saying, we're going to serve this\nclass of consumers. That's your privilege. But what\nyou do is you have a market participation which is\nsanctioned by the criminal law. You've built this trash\nutopia where everybody sends wonderful trash and you\nenforce use of that by the criminal law. So you're\nengaging as a market participant, but you're taking an\nextra advantage by using the criminal law to enforce, to\nenforce its use.\nMR. CAHILL: Your Honor, I don't -- I agree\nwith you that we're providing a service here, and we do\nuse the law to require that haulers and generators\nparticipate in the service that we -- in the system that\nwe've created. We need to have -- to achieve the goals\nthat we're trying to achieve. We've asked our public to\nseparate their wastes and we've asked our haulers to\ncollect it in a way that's consistent with the programs\nthat we've established.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You could do that by\nrequiring all trash pickup to segregate recyclable and\nnon-recyclable, and if it's going to cost each\nhouseholder just as much trouble then there could be\ncompetition and you would have achieved your goal. No?\nMR. CAHILL: No, Your Honor. There is no\ncompetition between our program and -- that's offered by\nthe private sector. What we do is different than what\nthe private sector offers and there's no place else for\nit to go. The haulers are required today to comply with\nthe program and to coordinate their activities with the\nseparation done by the residents and the facilities that\nthe authority has putting to.\nWe do things -- we have three different,\nthree basic differences between what we do and what the\nprivate sector would do. The first one is to step in\nand take some of the risk for proper disposal. When the\nhaulers make the decision about where the garbage goes,\nthere's a liability that attaches to the waste. If it\ngoes to the wrong place it's going to follow, follow\nback both to the hauler and to the person who generated\nit. We have had some bad experiences with people making\nbad decisions about where waste goes in the 1980s and\nthe public asked us to set something up so that they\ncould trust who was making the disposal decisions. So\nas a government we've stepped into that problem. We've\nstepped into the shoes of the generator, and we're\ntrying to set up a place --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You could do that by law.\nYou could do that by law. You could specify that only\ncertain waste facilities can be used.\nMR. CAHILL: I think not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have to run the\nbusiness in order to assure that, do you?\nMR. CAHILL: I think we do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why?\nMR. CAHILL: Because we don't have the power\nas a local government in New York to talk to landfills\nin Ohio or Pennsylvania about how they should run their\nfacilities. The only way that we can be sure that it\ngoes to the right place, that's engineered the right way\nand built the right way and run the right way is to\noffer to do it ourselves. And that's what we've --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But none of that -- in\nanswer to my earlier question, I thought you said none\nof that really matters, right? The only thing that\nmatters is that this is a publicly owned facility. You\ncould be selling hamburgers or renting videos and it\nwould come out the same way.\nMR. CAHILL: I think why public ownership\nmatters is that it's not discriminatory. I think the\nstrict scrutiny test should not apply when government\nowns --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So your answer is yes?\nMR. CAHILL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't matter?\nHamburgers are just as good?\nMR. CAHILL: Well, hamburgers, Your Honor,\nif the government was going to be the sole purveyor of\nhamburgers in a community, I think they'd have to have a\nvery, very good reason. If they had such a good reason,\nthen yes, government could do that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's just a\nquestion of New York law, isn't it?\nMR. CAHILL: Of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't know, I don't know\nwhat municipalities can do in New York. You say they've\ngot to have a good reason. I assume you're referring to\nNew York law for that purpose.\nMR. CAHILL: I am not, Your Honor. I have\nno idea --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What are you referring to,\nthen?\nMR. CAHILL: The concept, the concept that\ngovernment might be, might find it necessary to get into\nthe hamburger business. I can't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then essentially it's just\na political check on it. When you say there's got to be\na good reason, politically people would get mad if you\ndidn't have a good reason; is that basically it?\nMR. CAHILL: That's one reason. It would\nalso --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But there's no Commerce\nClause reason?\nMR. CAHILL: I think there's no Commerce\nClause reason.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. CAHILL: I think there's no Commerce\nClause reason.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Cahill, you started to\ntell us three reasons why it was important that you\nregulate. You gave us one. Mention the other two.\nMR. CAHILL: The other two are, Your Honor,\nthat we are fulfilling national objectives in trying to\nestablish the system that reduces the amount of waste\nthat we generate and recycles as much as possible.\nThat's not necessarily something that the private sector\nwould do. A landfill is not built to discourage the\namount of waste that comes through it. Our system is\ndesigned to try to change the habits of our citizens and\nincrease recycling --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but it's basic\nCommerce Clause analysis that a State has no interest in\nwhat happens to the product out of State. Baldwin\nversus Seelig.\nMR. CAHILL: Your Honor, I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You can't say we want --\nwe're enacting this law to affect what happens in other\nStates. That's just contrary to the Commerce Clause.\nMR. CAHILL: We are not attempting to\nregulate what goes on in other States. We\nare attempting --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I thought that was\njust the answer you gave to Justice Stevens on your\npoint two.\nMR. CAHILL: We are attempting to protect\nour own citizens by reducing the liabilities that they\nmay incur if that waste is shipped anywhere outside of\nthe counties. We hope to give them a better solution\nfor disposal than they would get from the marketplace.\nTo the extent that liability crosses state lines, we are\ntrying to protect our citizens from that liability --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whether they want the\nprotection or not?\nMR. CAHILL: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And whether a private\nindividual can come and offer them the same protection\nfor less money or not?\nMR. CAHILL: Yes, Your Honor, that's true.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're the government and\nwe're here to help you?\nMR. CAHILL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't that almost a\nfourth point? I realize you didn't get the third point\nout yet. But isn't -- I remember your brief and isn't\nthere sort of a fourth point? And that is, I will\nassume that the government does have some basic health\nand safety objectives and the objective to protect its\ncitizens here.\nMR. CAHILL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If the government tries to\npursue these policies solely by private inducement,\ntrash haulers may say, we don't want to deal on those\nterms, we can haul somewhere else, in another county,\nanother State, what-not.\nBy taking on the job itself, the government\nin effect is guaranteeing that to the extent it can\nprotect its citizens, induce respect for environmental\npolicy, and so on, it will do so without any cessation\nof service? There's kind of an assurance of service\nplus the objectives that the government gets by running\nthe plant itself. And isn't that sort of the nub of all\nof your points?\nMR. CAHILL: Yes, Your Honor, that's true.\nThat is the essence of government. We are there and we\nare going to have to stay there. Whether -- where a\nprivate entity might decide to go out of business\ntomorrow, government is going to be there to continue to\ndo what we set out to do.\nBut this leads me also to my third point,\nwhich is that we're attempting to implement a\ncomprehensive solid waste plan. With the passage of\nFederal legislation on these environmental matters\ntouching on waste in the 1970s, with the Resource\nConservation and Recovery Act, and With the\nComprehensive Environmental Response and Liability Act,\nthere was a new message sent to the country, which to\ngenerators meant, you better think about what you're\ndoing with this stuff. You better make a -- you better\nwatch where it goes and you better be careful because\nliability could attach to you.\nAnd RCRA told government, States and\nlocalities, it was their responsibility to come up with\nplans to find new ways to manage solid wastes. That's\nwhat we've done. Any time a government comes together\nto put a plan together to dispose of solid wastes,\nwhether like ours it uses several different technologies\nto try to address different parts of the waste stream,\nyou have to have the cooperation of the people who\ncollect the waste. If the people who collect the waste\ncould drive its away to anywhere they please, the plan\nis no plan; the plan is just a suggestion. The haulers\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Who mandated this plan?\nThe State of New York?\nMR. CAHILL: The State of New York.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the State of New York\ncan't mandate what happens to interstate commerce.\nMR. CAHILL: No, Your Honor, it cannot.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If you say the Congress of\nthe United States has authorized discrimination against\ninterstate commerce, then of course it can do that.\nThat has happened.\nMR. CAHILL: That is not our position, Your\nHonor. We're not saying that RCRA or any of these\nstatutes authorize discrimination against interstate\ncommerce. What the Federal statutes did do, however,\nwas recognize that the states do have the sovereign\npower to act, and they expected the states to act in\nthis way.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's take one of these\nclassic discrimination cases involving milk. I think\nwhat you're telling us is that if Wisconsin adopted a\nlaw requiring all milk to be pasteurized at a facility\nowned and operated by the State of Wisconsin, that would\nbe perfectly okay.\nMR. CAHILL: That would not discriminate\nagainst interstate commerce.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. And it would\nreally advantage Wisconsin dairy farmers, wouldn't it,\nand really disadvantage out of Wisconsin dairy farmers,\nand you think that the Commerce Clause doesn't speak to\nthat.\nMR. CAHILL: No, I do think the Commerce\nClause speaks to it, Your Honor, but I just -- our\nposition is it just doesn't require strict scrutiny. I\nthink the Pike test is a very good test to get to the\nbottom of why Wisconsin would want to do such a thing,\nand it would also be a good test to show just what the\nadverse impact on interstate commerce was, and what\nprecisely the benefits of, to Wisconsin there might be.\nI think the Pike test --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then, the\nCommerce Clause would become the vehicle by which we\nwould develop federal law about what's appropriate for\nmunicipal governments to do and what's not appropriate?\nWe could decide it may be appropriate to run waste\nfacilities but not to run milk pasteurization. I don't\nknow how we would do that.\nMR. CAHILL: I don't know how you would do\nthat either, Your Honor, but you would be led into that\nby accepting the petitioner's argument that public\nservices and private sector services are comparable\nunder the Commerce Clause. To go back to your example,\nearlier, Justice Scalia --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if we accepted\nthat argument, we would treat the public services just\nlike we treat, you know, the legislation favoring\nprivate companies. You're the one that's arguing for\nspecial treatment based on public ownership.\nMR. CAHILL: I think we are not, Your Honor.\nI think public ownership and public services are unique\nand they're different, and they should be subject to\nCommerce Clause scrutiny, but not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the whole point\nis these are not unique. The whole point is there are\nprivate companies that provide these kinds of services.\nMaybe water, maybe electricity, maybe those are or are\nnot unique. But you can't say that this is a unique\nservice being provided by government.\nMR. CAHILL: I think the approach that\nOneida-Herkimer has taken is in fact unique. It is\ntailored to our local situation. It's not something\nthat the marketplace would provide if the government was\nnot there. And if the Petitioner's idea that any\ngovernment service could be challenged under the dormant\nCommerce Clause simply because there's a private entity\nout there that says they could do the same thing were\naccepted, the definition of discrimination would be\nchanged from differential treatment of economic\ninterests to differential treatment of government or\neconomic interests. And whether we use the taxing power\nor police power to support a public enterprise, it would\nbe subject to challenge.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the challenge here\nisn't gauging this business, the question is whether you\ncan require everybody in the area to go through the one\nfacility and pay a tipping fee.\nMR. CAHILL: Yes.\nI would like to close, I think, because I'm\nrunning out of time, with just the admonition or\nrequirement that we are, in providing a public service,\nstill subject to the Constitution and we must deal with\nthe part private sector fairly. But if we do deal with\nthe private sector fairly and we don't favor anyone in\nstate or anyone out of state, we should be judged under\nthe balancing test of Pike, so that the Court, if the\ncourt below found the benefits of our system\nsubstantially outweigh any incidental burdens that are\nplaced on it by commerce, placed on commerce by the\nsystem. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Cahill.\nMs. Halligan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CAITLIN J. HALLIGAN\nON BEHALF OF NEW YORK AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. HALLIGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAs you suggested, Justice Breyer, the theory\nthat petitioners would have the Court adopt here is in\nfact a novel one. What they are suggesting is that\nthere is discrimination sufficient to trigger near fatal\nscrutiny every time the government takes over, to the\nexclusion of all private actors both in state and out of\nstate, a government service, that that is sufficient to\ntrigger strict scrutiny. That is completely\ninconsistent with the way that this Court has defined\nwhat constitutes discrimination for purposes of the\ndormant Commerce Clause.\nThe Court has said, and it has stressed\nrepeatedly in its precedent, that discrimination is the\ndifferential treatment of in state and out of State\neconomic interests, not government interests, in a way\nthat benefits the former and burdens the latter. That's\nfrom Oregon Waste System.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you a sort of\nsimple question. Is there an interstate impact on, of a\nmunicipal rule whether it is milk, or garbage, or what,\nthat says all of this product must be processed within\nthis city before it can go out of State?\nMS. HALLIGAN: There may well be an\ninterstate impact.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Doesn't that have a burden\non interstate commerce?\nMS. HALLIGAN: It may well, and that is\nsomething that is appropriately judged under the Pike\nstandard.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't that exactly what we\nhave here?\nMS. HALLIGAN: I think that you do have that\nhere, and you should judge it under the Pike valency\ntest, not under the near fatal scrutiny that's, that's\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But Pike doesn't apply to\ndiscrimination. Pike applies to burdens.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Yes, Your Honor. And where\nyou have --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems you are\nconflating the two.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Respectfully, I disagree,\nYour Honor. Where you have the government taking over a\nservice entirely, that doesn't constitute discrimination\nbecause there is no local private interest that is\nadvantaged, and no burden that is shifted to out of\nstate interest. That is where the dormant Commerce\nClause is primarily --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So long as the government\nenters the commercial market, it can, it can create\nFortress California? MS. HALLIGAN: We're not asking\nfor a rule that broad, Your Honor. What we are\nsuggesting is that where you have a publicly owned\noperation, a government operation, and it does not\ndisproportionately benefit in state or local interests,\nas against out of state interests -- But it always does.\nIt benefits the people of the State, who make the money\nfrom the money from the, from the very expensive\nhamburgers that are sold by the State of California.\nMS. HALLIGAN: If --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It always benefits the\nState of California.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you're saying so long\nas it doesn't benefit one particular malefactor of great\nwealth in the State of California, it is okay.\nMS. HALLIGAN: No, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see the distinction\nas far as the harm to the national market is concerned.\nMS. HALLIGAN: If you were to have\ngovernment action, for example, someone suggested could\nthe government sell hamburgers. I believe Justice Alito\nsuggested that, and that was to operate to the\ndisadvantage of out of state interests, even if it only\nadvantaged one in state interest, we would agree that\nthat would be appropriate for treatment under strict\nscrutiny. But that's not what you have here.\nWhat both the district court and the circuit\ncourt in fact found here is that the primary burden of\nthese local ordnances in fact is on local residents.\nAnd so the political process check that this Court has\nfound critical in cases like Minnesota versus Cloverleaf\nand Wunnicke is very much precedent here. This is not\nan attractive proposition that these localities have\nentered into.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What would you do with\nJustice Alito's question? Dean Milk versus Madison:\nAll milk must be processed whether been 20 miles of\nwhere it's --\nMS. HALLIGAN: It's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- produced.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Held discriminatory\nagainst interstate commerce. Could -- under your view,\ncould your city require all milk be pasteurized within\nyour city at a government owned, city owned facility?\nMS. HALLIGAN: If that rule imposed no\ndisproportionate benefits on out of state --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but Justice Scalia\nsays it always does because it benefits the locality.\nMS. HALLIGAN: It's different if it benefits\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You have -- by criminal\nlaws --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You -- I'm sorry. We're\nlooking at the interstate aspect from the wrong point of\nview.\nI'm a home owner. I have two choices. I\neither send it to the local facility or I can ship it\nover to New Jersey. You're telling me I can't ship it\nto New Jersey. Doesn't that burden an interstate\ntransaction?\nMS. HALLIGAN: This is very different from\nthose kinds of export bans. Those export bans did one\nof two things.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: This is an export ban.\nMS. HALLIGAN: The export bans that this\nCourt has struck down either created local --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Your case involves an\nexpert ban. All the trash has to be processed in your\ntipping facility.\nMS. HALLIGAN: It does, and it does, and to\nthe extent that's what you are characterizing as an\nexport ban, that's certainly correct. What the Court\nhas found problematic about export bans are either that\nthey are put in place to create local to correct\neconomic opportunities, for example the timber cases or\nthe shrimp cases.\nThat's not what you have here. There's no\nallegation that the purposes of these statutes is to\nfoster or promote local industry. In fact, the only\nplaintiffs in this case are local haulers themselves.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is an\nallegation that you charge above market rates to pursue\nparticular economic goals that the municipality has.\nMS. HALLIGAN: For a different basket of\nservices, Your Honor. A basket of services that\nincludes a wider range of, of goals that the private\nsector has no Interest in providing.\nTo return, to return to the question of\nwhether or not this is an inappropriate benefit for the\ncitizens, I would argue that there is a meaningful\ndistinction between government taking an action which\nbenefits the citizens as a whole, which we would hope\nany government law would -- any law passed by a\ngovernment would do, as opposed to a law that benefits a\nlocal private economic interest and is intended to do\nso.\nFor the dormant Commerce Clause to reach\nthat far would be unprecedented. It would implicate not\nonly electricity but under Petitioner's theory it would\nimplicate, I would think for example government\ndecisions to provide prison and correctional services\nthrough a public system as opposed to a private one.\nWhat about school bus services? Car insurance --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If only facilities\non your side of the case that are traditional municipal\nservices, but then this seems to be at the borderline.\nI mean, on the other side, they have the hamburger cases\nor the milk processing cases. How do we decide whether\nthis is one of the traditional governmental services,\nthe police, the prisons, whatever, or is it one of these\nthat looks more like regular market participation?\nMS. HALLIGAN: Two answers if I can, Your\nHonor. First of all, I think this Court has answered\nthat question with respect to waste management more than\na hundred years ago in the California Reduction case.\nIt was clearly held there the provision of waste\nmanagement services is an essential function that\ngovernments appropriately provide.\nSo that's been answered here. With respect\nto this question about hamburgers and other services\nthat look commercial, I think there are two checks on\nthose kinds of ordinances. First of all, I think it is\nvery likely that in most circumstances if you were to\nsay that hamburgers will be sold at a government\noperated facility, that that would disadvantage local\ninterests significantly, and there would be a political\nprocess check.\nSecondly the Court has been clear that it is\nnot bound by formalistic distinctions in the Commerce\nClause arena and so it will look for discrimination that\nis protectionist in nature whether it is, as the Court\nhas said, forthright or ingenious. So if case were to\npresent itself, and the facts in the facts in this case\nno whiff of that protectionism, where you were to\nbelieve that the motive of a government entity was, in\nfact, to favor some local private interest, then strict\nscrutiny might be appropriate.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is that what it turns on,\nthe motive? If the motive were to keep the jobs at the\nplant in New York, rather than in some facility outside\nof New York, that would be, that would make a\ndifference?\nMS. HALLIGAN: No, I think this Court has\nheld the purpose alone cannot cure an inappropriate\nmeans that is used. But what we are arguing is that\nhere you have both a very legitimate purpose, as my\nco-counsel outlined for you; you also have appropriate\nmeans. It is not inappropriate under the dormant\nCommerce Clause for the government to step in and take\nover provision of a service. Petitioners themselves\nagree that, in fact, the government could take over\nwaste management services from soup to nuts. They\nsuggest that there is some difference of a\nconstitutional magnitude because some aspect of that is\ncontracted out to the private market, and would argue\nthat actually turns the dominant Commerce Clause on its\nhead.\nOne final point, if I could make. Several\nof you asked about whether or not there are other\nmechanisms that the localities could use to further\nthese goals, goals which are set forth in both Federal\nand State laws.\nFirst of all, under the Pike test, there is\nno least restrictive alternative test. So it is not\nrequired that the localities demonstrate that there is\nno other option that might meet these goals. The Second\nCircuit concluded and rightly so I think on page 20a of\nthe appendix to the petition that there was no other\noption that presented itself in the record that the\ncounties could address, or could use to address their\nliability concerns and to encourage recycling across a\nvery wide range of products.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is no determinative\nelement in the Pike test whatever. It is a totality of\nthe circumstances test, right?\nMS. HALLIGAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's wonderful.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. HALLIGAN: And we suggest that that is\nthe appropriate test here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Halligan, how do you\nanswer something in the Petitioner's brief that says\nthere's no difference between this case and Carbone\nbecause these transfer stations are constructed and\noperated by a private company?\nMS. HALLIGAN: I think that that distinction\nis essential here. It is essential because of the\npurposes of the dormant Commerce Clause. These are\npublicly owned facilities. The facility in Carbone was\nprivately owned and as you suggested, Justice Ginsburg,\nthe opinion is replete with careful references to that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where do you, where\ndo you come out on the 50-50 facility?\nMS. HALLIGAN: I think that's a hard\nquestion, Your Honor. And I think there the kind of\napproach that the Court took in a case like Westland\nCreamery and Hunt versus Washington Apple is helpful.\nIf it appears to the Court that the motive\nis protectionist then it is appropriate to apply strict\nscrutiny. Whether that line is 50 percent, 55 percent\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought you\nsaid earlier motive was not the test, in response to I\nthink it was Justice Alito.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Yes, Your Honor. I'm saying\nyou should look as you have -- and I see my time is up.\nIf I may continue -- you should look as you have, in all\nof the dormant Commerce Clause cases at the context that\nis presented. So if there is 100 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you. Thank\nyou, Counsel.\nMr. Tager you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EVAN TAGER,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. TAGER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe first point I'd like to make is I'd like\nto ask the Court to review Reeves versus Stake which is\na market participant case. But what is significant\nthere -- that's the cement plant case -- there's two\nsignificant things about that case which I think are of\ninterest.\nFirst, the Court's footnote 1 is an\ninteresting historical footnote about how South Dakota\nhad elected to make a lot of these different industries\nstate-run industries, so the hypotheticals we've been\ndiscussing are not completely off the wall.\nIf you can do it for waste you can do it\nfor, in that case coal. They wanted to do it for\nstockyards but I think the legislature rejected the\ngovernment's proposal. So the hypos are right on point.\nSecondly, the Court made a point there in\nrejecting the argument, the constitutional argument that\nthe state was not prohibiting competing cement\ncompanies. And I think the inference from that is that\nit had, there would have been a Commerce Clause problem.\nSecond, Mr. Cahill's user -- user fee point.\nI just want to remind the Court that in addition to\npaying for the recycling and everything, they were using\nthe user fee to pay off the bond for their failed energy\nrecovery facility. So, if you start focusing on what\nyou use it for, it is a very slippery slope.\nOn his point about protecting the generator\nfrom liability, we've addressed that at great lengths in\nour briefs. But one other point I want to make is he's\nwrong about their ability to determine whether other\nfacilities that the haulers want to use are safe for\nenvironmental purposes. That's exactly what the city of\nNew York does. Because it doesn't have its own disposal\nfacility, its got very stringent requirements for where\nthe waste can be taken.\nFourth, Justice Souter, I believe you were\nraising an inquiry about the political process and\nwhether that's adequate to protect the out of State\ninterests.\nAnd I'd like to refer you to the West Lynn\nCreamery decision where the Court said the people whose\noxen are being gored by a tariff are the local residents\nas well, but a tariff is the prototypical Commerce\nClause violation. The political process is simply not a\ngood answer to our argument.\nIn terms of your other question about --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A tariff is also imposed by\na State, isn't it? As opposed to --\nMR. TAGER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Money goes to a State.\nMR. TAGER: It would go to a State. I\nsuppose it could be done by a subdivision, though.\nOn Ms. Halligan's point about California\nReduction, I just would like to remind the Court that\nthat was a case of flow control to a private company.\nSo Carbone, to the extent that case was concerned at all\nwith the Commerce Clause, and it didn't say that it was,\nit was a taking case, I think, it has been overruled to\nthe extent it had any Commerce Clause implications.\nFinally, I would like end with the point\nthat Carbone has been the law for 13 years -- may I\nfinish?\nIf the Respondents have a problem with\nCarbone, Congress can fix it. That's one of the unique\nthings about the Commerce Clause that is different from\nother constitutional provisions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
