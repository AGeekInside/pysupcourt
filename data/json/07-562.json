        "content": "(10:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this term in Altria Group v. Stephanie Good.\nMr. Olson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nRespondents' state law claims track nearly\nverbatim the Cigarette Labeling Act's pre-emption\nprovision. For example, the complaint challenges\npromotions of light cigarettes as less harmful and safer\nto smokers than regular cigarettes. But the statute,\nCongress, explicitly preempted any requirement\nrespecting the promotion of cigarettes based upon\nsmoking and health. In short, the Respondents are\nseeking in state court precisely what Congress\npre-empted. There is no space --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Olson, what if\nthe state law claim did not require any inquiry into the\nrelationship between smoking and health? Something\nalong the lines of saying our studies show that light\ncigarettes are healthier for you, and in fact their\nstudies show the opposite. So all you, all the\nplaintiff would have to show is that there was a\ndeception, a disconnect between the studies and the ad.\nIt wouldn't matter whether light cigarettes were\nhealthier or not healthier. Is that the type of action\nthat could be brought?\nMR. OLSON: Well, I think the facts could\ndiffer from case to case, Mr. Chief Justice. But the\ninquiry is going to be generally, I think, simple: Is\nthere a requirement? Is it based upon smoking and\nhealth, and does it appear in an advertising or\npromotion of a cigarette. Now, I suppose there might be\nconceivably circumstances where it's impossible to tell\nthat the requirement is not connected in some way with\nsmoking and health, but it's certainly clear here.\nThe complaint specifically talks in terms of\npromoting cigarettes, purporting to be less harmful or\nsafer, despite serious health problems associated with\nsmoking. These appear at the beginning in paragraph 2\nof the amended complaint which is at pages, beginning\nJoint Appendix pages 26 through 28. I invite the\nCourt's attention to paragraph 2 of the amended\ncomplaint and paragraphs 15 and 18 of the amended\ncomplaint. In fact, the words \"promotion,\"\n\"cigarettes,\" \"smoking,\" \"safety,\" and \"health,\" the\nvery words that appear in the Labeling Act statute,\nappear, I counted at least 12 times in the amended\ncomplaint.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it a question of just\nhow you phrase it, Mr. Olson? Is there any scope --\ndoes your argument leave any scope for attorney general,\nstate attorney general imposition of state law remedies\nagainst a deceptive practice involving advertising\ncigarettes. To give you concrete examples, suppose a\nstate attorney general said in every - suppose the\npractice were in every carton of cigarettes the\ncigarette manufacturer includes an insert that says: If\nyou want to ingest less nicotine, buy our cigarettes; if\nyou want to ingest less nicotine, buy our cigarettes.\nAnd the state attorney general goes after that statement\nin the carton as false and deceptive advertising. Would\nthere be any scope for that?\nMR. OLSON: I think that there is. In\nanswer to the general question that you ask, Justice\nGins burg, there is plenty of room for an attorney\ngeneral to pursue deceptive advertising. Another\nexample -- and I'll come to the one you mentioned -- is\nthat someone might misrepresent the number of cigarettes\nin a package or other things having to do with\ncigarettes. That would not necessarily be related to\nsmoking and health. So there is not a pre-emption if\nthere is not a relationship between the prohibition and\nsmoking and health. The example you gave might require\nsome sort of inquiry as to what is motivating the\nattorney general. The motivation is what you referred\nto, your Court referred to in the Reilly case and I\nwould say --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Olson, doesn't your\nanswer in effect, in practical terms, exclude the\npossibility of inserts like that? I mean, what else\nwould they be addressing except smoking and health?\nThat's the only subject on the table.\nMR. OLSON: I think that's probably true in\nmost cases, Justice Souter, that the reason why there\nmight be regulations at the State level having to do\nwith cigarettes and advertising by and large is going to\nhave to do with smoking and health. The Court went\nthrough the same inquiry in the Reilly case where it had\nto do with billboards and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So your answer then to my\nspecific example would be the attorney general could not\ngo after such a statement, \"If you want to ingest less\nnicotine, buy our cigarettes\"?\nMR. OLSON: If -- if the courts were to\nconclude that it had a relationship with smoking and\nhealth, the answer is yes, Justice Ginsburg, but there\nmight be some case in which someone said, well, the\nissue about nicotine and content of nicotine is being\nregulated because it doesn't have anything to do with\nsmoking and health, but in the environment in which this\n-- this statute was passed and this litigation was\npursued, there certainly isn't any question here. Now,\nI think Justice Stevens, even in his dissenting opinion\nin the Reilly case, focused on the content. He said and\nthe -- your dissenting opinion in that case said, as\nopposed to location, that the Labeling Act was focusing\non the content of advertising.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose that a new\ndrug is found for the treatment of a condition, glaucoma\n-- hypothetical -- and the evidence is stunningly clear\nthat smoking with this new drug causes a severe allergic\nreaction. Does the cigarette manufacturer have any duty\nto disclose this on the label or in promotions?\nMR. OLSON: No, Justice Kennedy, to the --\nthe Federal Trade Commission, by the way, has full\nauthority to regulate deceptive --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, I -- they've just\nfound this out last week. Do they have any -- there can\nbe no -- I take it under your position there can be no\nsuit based on misleading or false promotion or labeling,\nand there can be no suit even for the sale of an unsafe\nitem?\nMR. OLSON: Well, there could be -- the\nStates may regulate the sale of items. The Labeling Act\nprovision only relates to promotion, marketing,\nadvertising, and that sort of thing. The State can\nprohibit the sale of cigarettes. States and\nmunicipalities have done that sort of thing. This\nstatute has three provisions in it: Is what the State\nis attempting to do a requirement or prohibition.\nThere's no question that that's involved here. Does it\nhave to do with the advertising or promotion of\ncigarettes? There's no question that this complaint is\naimed at the advertising and promotion of cigarettes.\nAnd does the advertising or promotion have to do with\nsmoking and health?\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, in your view, it says\nin Cipollone that this -- that the four people said in\nCipollone that this statute does not pre-empt State law\nwhere it's based on a prohibition of making a false\nstatement of material fact. For example, to make a\nfunny example, somebody could advertise smoking 42\ncigarettes a day will grow back your hair.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's totally false, and\nin your view, that would be pre-empted, if Congress\nattempted to pre-empt a state law that says you cannot\nmake a completely false statement of material fact --\nMR. OLSON: I don't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- if it's based on -- has\nsomething to do with smoking and health.\nMR. OLSON: I don't mean to be whimsical,\nbut I think that, to the extent there's a representation\nwith respect to growing hair or something like that,\nthat may not -- it probably isn't -- have to do with\nsmoking and health.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I was trying to\nproduce an -- I mean, it will build strong bodies eight\nways.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: Yes. And let me say with\nrespect to the Cipollone plurality opinion, which was\nfound to be baffling, confusing, litigation- generating,\neasily abated by the labeling of the complaint, and\nsuperseded by a number of subsequent decisions by this\nCourt, it should be set aside and restated. However,\nthe very case that the Cipollone decision in the\nplurality did decide was pre-empted even under that\nplurality opinion, and this is at page 527 of the\nopinion, is an advertising that purported to neutralize,\nminimize, down-play, negate, or disclaim the warning\nlabel on the packages. This complaint is precisely that\nclaim. You could probably not have written a claim more\nsquarely --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Excuse me. The reason I\nthink the plurality wrote this, I'm guessing, is that\nwhen you read through this statute it seems as if what\nCongress had in mind in the statute was not setting\naside State law, which is tradition, about not making\nfalse statements, false and deceptive advertising law.\nIt was concerned with a different thing. They said, to\nthe cigarette companies: You have to put on the label\n\"Smoking is dangerous to your health.\" We don't want\nStates telling you to put other things like that on the\nlabel, and we don't want States forbidding you to put a\npicture of the Marlboro man or Lauren Bacall with her\ncigarette. We don't want States to tell you that you\ncan't do that. That would be focused on the object of\nthe statute, which no one said had as its objective\nsetting aside traditional unfair and deceptive\nadvertising law. I think that's the argument.\nMR. OLSON: That is the argument, and the\nRespondents are making that argument. I submit that\nthat argument is squarely answered by the text of the\nstatute, which this Court has said again and again you\nhave to turn to. The text of the statute says no\nrequirement or prohibition; it doesn't say no\nrequirement or prohibition except one which is expressly\nmisleading. And the reason you mentioned, Justice\nBreyer, what was the background for the statute or what\nwas Congress intending to do, well, fortunately on\nsection 1331 of the Labeling Act, which is on 1A of the\nblue brief, Congress declares its policy and purpose\nsquarely, unequivocally, and in what this Court said in\nReilly was sweeping language: Any relationship between\nsmoking and health. And then Congress went on to point\nout that with the labeling requirements, it intended for\nconsumers to receive certain information about the\nsmoking of cigarettes with specific labels, and then\nwent on to say, without hurting the commerce and the\nnational economy to be protected from confusing\ncigarette labeling and advertising regulations that\nmight be \"non-uniform, confusing, or diverse.\"\nNow, Justice Stevens again in the Reilly\nopinion when he was distinguishing in his concurring\nopinion -- I can't recall whether it's a concurring or\ndissenting opinion -- focused on the fact that different\nrequirements by different States might cause those very\ndiverse, confusing advertising. If one State says,\nyou've got to put something else in there about this;\none State says that so-called descriptors are\nmisleading, as was the case under this case, and another\nState says, like Illinois said in another case, that\nthey are not misleading; that national advertising\nbecomes impossible. That's inconsistent and Congress\nexpressed what its policy was.\nAnd, Justice Breyer, the Court went through\nthe same process in the Morales case and the Wolens case\nin connection with airline and deregulation and whether\nor not misleading advertising might be expressly\npre-empted. The Court went through the same sort of\nprocess in the Riegel case with respect to medical\ndevices. The Court went through the same process in the\nRowe case, decided on the same day as Riegel in\nconnection with another context. And again, with\nrespect to the Reilly case, the Court --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Olson, you're relying\non 1334(b), I take it, specifically.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Stevens. Not just\n1334(b) but 1331, which it helps explain.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the prohibition you're\ntalking about is in 13 -- in your express pre-emption\nargument -- 1334(b). And I was just going to ask you,\nis a State requirement prohibiting false statements\nabout smoking and health a requirement based on smoking\nand health?\nMR. OLSON: I think it is, unless I\nmisunderstood your question. If a State decides what\nmay be in the advertising or promotion --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The predicate for \"based\non smoking\" is the word \"requirement.\" And a\nrequirement that you may not make any false statements,\nwould that be a requirement based on smoking and health?\nMR. OLSON: Well, the statute contains the\nwords both \"requirement\" and \"prohibition.\" And in your\nplurality opinion in Cipollone on page 527, the same\npage I mentioned before, you made the point that a\nprohibition is merely the converse of a requirement.\nAnd either a prohibition or a requirement with respect\nto advertising if it relates to smoking and health is\npre-empted.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The question I'm asking,\nthough, is a requirement that you make no false\nstatements a requirement based on smoking and health?\nMR. OLSON: Yes. And to the extent -- no,\nwe are not saying that the Massachusetts unfair-\npractices statute is preempted in all respects. It's\nonly when the statute, like a common law tort provision\nwhich the Court considered in Riegel, has application to\nthe context of smoking and health.\nIf the Court starts with the Morales case\nthrough the Wolens case, through the Bates case, through\nthe Riegel case, through the Reilly case, it's the\napplication of the statute in the Reilly case. It was a\n-- it was a statute of Massachusetts very much\nidentical, virtually identical, to the Maine statute\nhere. And in the -- in the Reilly case the attorney\ngeneral was attempting to apply the generalized,\nunfair-practice statute to the advertising of smoking\nand cigarettes near schools.\nThis is a similar statute, which is\nattempted to be applied in the context of these labels\nand the advertising of cigarettes. It's the application\nof a generalized statute. This Court repeatedly said,\nand specifically said in the Riegel case, there is\nhardly any common law requirements which are\nrequirements, the Court has repeatedly held -- and the\nRespondents don't dispute that; they specifically\nacknowledge it -- when it's the application of a general\nstandard to the circumstances of the case. That's where\nthe pre-emption occurs.\nCongress didn't want to pre-empt general\ncommon law standards about fraud or misrepresentation or\nanything like that except in the context of the\nmarketing --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why -- why would\nCongress -- I mean the difficulty that the other side\nraises here is just what Cipollone said. I can\nunderstand totally why Congress would not want 50 States\ntelling cigarette companies what to say about health and\nsmoking or taking off pictures of the Marlboro ad. I\ncan understand that.\nWhat I can't understand is why Congress\nwould want to get rid of, in this area, the traditional\nrule that advertising has to tell the truth.\nNow, what you said was you could end up with\ndifferent applications of that in different States. Of\ncourse, every national advertiser faces that situation\nat the moment. Everyone who advertises across the\nnation could find deceptive -- anti-deception laws\ndifferently administered in different States. Yet,\nthey'd survive. There is no evidence even that there is\na problem. So why would Congress want to get rid of\nthat particular statute?\nMR. OLSON: Well, the Court -- and this\nCourt recently in Aetna v. Davila specifically said that\npre-emption can't be decided based upon the label that\nthe plaintiff puts in the complaint.\nNow, as I think every member of this Court\nwould know, a creative plaintiff's lawyer can call a\nclaim misrepresentation, willful misrepresentation,\nconcealment, failure to warn, and so on and so forth.\nIt's just a matter of how they change the label on the\ncomplaint.\nNow, what Congress didn't want -- and I just\ngave an example of a situation where Illinois decided\nthat the descriptors, which are an issue in this case\nwere not misleading; and it was not -- and they could\ncontinue to be used.\nWhat happened in this case in applying the\nMaine statute is a court decided that they were\nmisleading and -- and couldn't be used.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But did the Illinois --\nIllinois court reach the question whether the claim was\npre -- pre-empted? I think it firmly decided on the\nmerits there was no fraud, if I understand what you\nsaid.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct, and I'm not\nsaying --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So we must assume there\nwas no pre-emption, because it wouldn't have reached the\nmerits otherwise.\nMR. OLSON: I -- I haven't got all of the\nspecifics of that case; but what I felt -- I just simply\nmeant -- but I think it's an example of what you said in\nyour concurring opinion in Reilly: That if you're going\nto conduct a national advertising campaign, it can't be\ngoverned by what a jury might decide in Des Moines\nversus what a jury might decide in Birmingham, Alabama.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: When it's not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it the jury fracture?\nYou said the attorney general could not stop, my\nexample, \"If you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our\nlights.\" The attorney general could not proscribe that.\nSo nothing that you're saying turns on it being the jury\nrather than the attorney general, does it?\nMR. OLSON: Well, no, that's absolutely --\nabsolutely correct, Justice Ginsburg. In fact, the\npanoply of this Court's decisions say that it doesn't\nmatter whether it's a statute -- a generalized statute\nthat's being applied or a common law standard that's\nbeing applied, and it does not matter whether it's an\nattorney general interpreting and enforcing general\nprovisions -- I give you Morales and the Wolens\nsituation -- or it's whether it's a common law tort\naction being brought by a plaintiff to submit a case to\na jury a la Riegel.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So your position is\nessentially that Congress, as -- as far as the\nadvertising of low or light, Congress empowered one\ndecisionmaker only and that's the FTC, and if they don't\nact then the cigarette companies can say anything they\nwant about low tar and low nicotine?\nMR. OLSON: Well, there is also -- I -- I\nthink it doesn't -- it's not dispositive of the\npre-emption case, but there's also the master settlement\nagreement that the tobacco companies entered into with\nthe States, which gives the States a lot of power to\nenforce various different things.\nBut I think that the point here is that,\nyes, Congress decided that it wanted one uniform source\nof regulation of advertising of cigarettes with respect\nto smoking and health. Now --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the -- does the\nconsent decree say anything about advertising low,\nlight, those specifics?\nMR. OLSON: The master settlement agreement?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: I -- I don't -- I can't answer\nthat question. I don't know the answer to that\nquestion, but what I -- I believe that it would allow\nbroad powers by the attorney generals. But I have --\nhasten to say, as I did at the beginning, because some\nparties entered into that master settlement agreement I\ndon't think changes the Federal -- the congressional\nintent is very clear. It wanted the -- the statement --\nCongress wanted the statements, certain statements, on\ncigarette packages. It didn't want any confusion about\nwhat the marketing or promotion of cigarettes would be.\nI can't imagine, Justice Ginsburg, a clearer\nstatement. It says no requirement or prohibition in\nsection 1334(b). And in 1331 it says \"comprehensive\nFederal programs that deal with cigarette labeling and\nadvertising with respect to any relationship between\nsmoking and health.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But, Mr. Olson, isn't the\nproblem that Congress was equally clear, or has at least\nbeen assumed to be equally clear, in a contrary line of\nreasoning that holds against you? And that line of\nreasoning is this: You agree -- everybody agrees --\nthat the FTC can represent -- it can regulate\nadvertising and -- and supposed deception on matters\nthat do affect -- relate to smoking and health.\nIt is pretty much hornbook law at this stage\nof the game that the -- that the FTC's regulation of\ndeceptive advertising does not exclude State regulation\nof deceptive advertising as a general proposition. In\nfact, the FTC is very happy to have complementary State\nregimes. That state of the law is just as clear. It is\nat least as clear as you say the language is here.\nNow, given the fact that the FTC can\nregulate advertising of cigarettes in -- in the -- in\nthe respect that matters here, why don't we have to give\nsome recognition to this complementary regime of State\nregulation, which, as a general proposition, survives\nit?\nMR. OLSON: Well, the point --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And all I'm saying is what\nwe have here is, you say, a clear preemption provision.\nBut we also have a clear regulatory regime which is at\nodds with that preemption provision, and presumably\nwe've got to give some effect to that, too.\nMR. OLSON: Well, the -- the statute deals\nwith this to a degree in section 1336 by saving certain\nresponsibilities. But I think the more powerful answer\nis that the background principle, the Federal Trade\nCommission Act and Federal and State Trade -- Fair\nPractices Act, are a part of a national scheme just\nexactly as you said. It's a background --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's part of a\nnational scheme, but in practical terms you can say that\non any subject matter that the FTC regulates. And,\nnonetheless, the complementary State regimes of -- of\nregulating deception survive.\nSo that the argument you are making here is\nan argument that can be made, I suppose, on every\nsubject that the FTC touches.\nMR. OLSON: Well, no. As a matter of fact,\nI could not disagree more, Justice Souter. That's the\ngeneral background scheme. Then Congress specifically\naddresses smoking and health in the advertising of\ncigarettes. The same --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your implied -- your\nimplied preemption argument would certainly fall prey to\nthat -- to that point.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it -- we have -- I'd like\nto spend no time on the implied preemption argument --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Good idea.\nMR. OLSON: -- because I think -- I think\nthis is the -- the -- that Congress could not have been\nmore clear. And another answer to your question,\nJustice Souter, is the Airline Deregulation Act.\nYou dealt -- you Court dealt with this in\nthe Morales case and the Wolens case. The -- you could\nhave said the same thing there: That there is a\nbackground principle against unfair --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Perhaps we did not think of\nit.\nMR. OLSON: I don't -- I think that it's\nclear that, looking at the briefs in that case, that\nthose very same arguments were made. The same argument\ncould have been made in the Riegel case with respect to\ndevices. The general principle that I'm making that I\nthink Congress understands, and this Court has clearly\nunderstood, is that there is a background principle that\nthe Federal Government is not pre-empting deceptive\npractice regulations except when Congress specifically\nsays so.\nNow, one more point because I think the\nwhite light will come on: the United States Government\ndid not address in this case the express pre-emption\nargument. But a few years ago, in the Reilly case,\nhaving to do with the very same statute, the Cigarette\nLabeling Act, the United States Government said that the\nlabeling act pre-empted State laws concerning the\ncontent of cigarette advertising, the content of\ncigarette advertising. That's what the government said\nthen and the Acting Solicitor General during the\nargument in that case, in response to a question by one\nof your members of this Court, specifically said the --\nthe statute would pre-empt State laws about filters or\nthe safety of a particular cigarette. That was the\nposition of the United States Government a couple of\nyears ago and they have not changed.\nMr. Chief Justice, if I may reserve the\nbalance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Olson.\nMr. Frederick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice\nand may it please the Court:\nWhen Congress enacted the Labeling Act, the\n1969 Labeling Act, it gave no intention whatsoever to\nimmunize cigarette makers for the false statements that\nthey made in violation of anti-deception in the\nmarketplace rules. They didn't empower the FTC with any\nspecial rulemaking authority that applied industrywide,\nand in fact the FTC's enforcement authority with respect\nto individual companies was quite limited. The argument\nthat Philip --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Frederick, suppose that\nthe FTC had adopted the rule that it considered in 1970\nand required that the tar and nicotine figures that were\nproduced by the particular testing method that is at\nissue here to be placed on all cigarette ads and\npromotions; and then suppose that Maine issued a\nregulation requiring that all ads and promotions in the\nState of Maine state that the Federal figures are\nmisleading and should be disregarded. Would that\nregulation be pre-empted?\nMR. FREDERICK: That would be implied\nconflict pre-emption, and we would acknowledge that\nwould be pre-empted. The difference here --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference\nbetween that situation and this situation?\nMR. FREDERICK: The difference here is that\nbetween a generally applicable rule that is specially\ntargeted at the cigarette industry and a generally\napplicable rule against deception, upon which a fact\nfinder would not need to make any special inquiry about\nsmoking and health.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that\nconsistent with what the Court said in the Riegel case\nwhere they said, and I'll quote: \"We have held that a\nprovision pre-empting State requirements pre-empted\ncommon law duties\"? That's no suggestion that this is a\ndistinction between a focused common law duty, which\nwould be unusual anyway, and general common law duty.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, I have three\nresponses, Mr. Chief Justice. The first is that the\ntext in Riegel was different; the purposes behind what\nCongress enacted in the medical device amendments were\ndifferent; and third, this Court twice, in both Reilly\nand in Cipollone, has looked at this exact statute and\ncome to the opposite conclusion.\nFirst with respect to the text of the\nmedical device amendments, there are several provisions\nof that act that are quite a bit broader than what the\n1969 Labeling Act --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say Riegel\nwasn't referring to the particular text of any statue.\nIt was making a general point. The Court said: We have\nheld that a provision pre-empting State requirements,\nwhich is exactly what this one does, pre-empted common\nlaw duties.\nMR. FREDERICK: And the result, Mr. Chief\nJustice, of virtually every one of this Court's\npre-emption cases has been to look at the particular\nwords of the statute to determine the scope of the\npre-emption. The Court did that in Bates. It did that\nin Morales. It did --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So as a general\nproposition -- I understand your position to be that\nthis particular statute doesn't pre-empt the common law\nduties, but the distinction I thought you articulated in\nresponse to Justice Alito's question was that general\ncommon law duties are not pre-empted; specific tailored\nones are.\nMR. FREDERICK: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree that a\ngeneral common law duty can be pre-empted by a\nparticular statute?\nMR. FREDERICK: I do acknowledge that,\nMr. Chief Justice. But my point is that in the medical\ndevice amendments what Congress was getting at were\nthings that were quite a bit broader and it had sweeping\nlanguage. It said not only to establish but also to\ncontinue in effect, with respect to a device, which\nrelates to the safety or effectiveness of the device, or\n\"to any other matter included in a requirement\napplicable to the device.\"\nBy contrast --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're -- so\nyou're saying that we should -- the difference in your\ncase is that the language here is narrower. It says \"no\nstatement relating to smoking or health.\" I don't see\nhow that language is narrower.\nMR. FREDERICK: No, I think you're quoting\n1334(a) and the pre-emption provision at issue here, Mr.\nChief Justice, is 1334(b) which says --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So 1334(b)\nsays \"no requirement or prohibition with respect to.\"\nIsn't that just as broad?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, no, it isn't, because\nthe modifying term that's at issue in this case comes\nbetween the two points that you quoted, and that's the\nphrase \"based on smoking and health.\" Our contention\nhere is that a generalized duty not to deceive is not a\nrequirement based on smoking and health. It's based on\na duty not to deceive.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you tell --\nhow do you tell whether it's deceptive or not if you\ndon't look at what the relationship is between smoking\nand health? They have an advertisement that says light\ncigarettes are better for you than regular cigarettes.\nYou have to know what the relationship is between\nsmoking and health to determine whether that's\ndeceptive.\nMR. FREDERICK: No, you don't. You have to\nlook at two products and determine whether or not they\nare achieving the same yield of tar and nicotine that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the\nrelationship between smoking and health.\nMR. FREDERICK: And the word \"relate\" does\nnot appear in 1334(b), and that is crucial because this\nCourt in Safeco v. Burr defined the phrase \"based upon\"\nto mean but-for causation: But for smoking and health,\nis there a requirement? The words \"related to\" have\nbeen defined by this Court in numerous pre-emption\ncases, including Morales, Wolens, ERISA cases, to be\namong the most sweeping language that Congress can use\nto denote a connection.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you have -- would\nhave you been satisfied if your complaint said this\ncomplaint does not seek any damages based on the link\nbetween smoking and health?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, the damages here, Mr.\nJustice Kennedy, are -- concern getting two products\nthat are not different. It's just like going to a car\ndealer and saying, I want a Ford and they --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you accept that\namendment to your complaint, that the plaintiff does not\nseek any damages based on some link between smoking and\nhealth?\nMR. FREDERICK: I think we would accept\nthat, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How can you accept that and\nthen expect to prove damages in the case? You can\naccept it to this extent, it seems to me. You can\naccept it in saying that what we are going to prove at\nstep number one is that it is false to indicate that\nsmoking light cigarettes will result in the ingestion of\nless tar and nicotine; and we know why you're saying\nthat. But in order to prove damages in your case, you\nwould have to say: People get hurt because there is a\nrelationship between the ingestion of tar and nicotine\nand their health; and the same cause -- the same causal\nconnection is therefore appropriate for -- for -- is\ntherefore necessary in order to prove that people were\nhurt.\nMR. FREDERICK: In fact in our case we are\nnot proving health-related damages.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're asking for\ninjunctive relief, I guess.\nMR. FREDERICK: No, we are not asking for\ninjunctive relief. We are asking damages for the\ndifference in value between a product we thought we were\nbuying and a product we actually bought.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the reason -- and the\nreason the product is of different value is that in fact\nit is dangerous to health, as opposed to -- or more\ndangerous or equally dangerous to health as opposed to\nless dangerous to health; so that at the causation stage\nyou've still got to prove the link between causation and\nhealth.\nMR. FREDERICK: I don't think so, Justice\nSouter. I think all we have to prove is that the\nproducts were different and that we relied materially on\na misrepresentation about what product to use.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you think you could\nrecover if the evidence showed simply that all your\nclients had the health of Olympic athletes?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You do?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, I do, because our\ndamages here, Justice Souter --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What would the harm be,\nsort of aesthetic?\nMR. FREDERICK: If we bought a product\nthinking that it would be a safer product and it was\nnot, and we would have quit smoking.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If they are healthy as\nhorses, you have no proof that it is not.\nMR. FREDERICK: We're -- yes, we do, because\nthe product is different. If you buy a car thinking\nit's a Ford and it's a Yugo but it still drives, you\nstill have a claim under the lemon laws for deceptive\nadvertising.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But what if Yugos and Fords\nare worth the same amount of money?\nMR. FREDERICK: That is an economic proof --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's the thing here.\nUnless you show that for some -- for some reason -- were\nlight cigarettes sold as a premium? Did they charge\nmore for light cigarettes?\nMR. FREDERICK: There is economic evidence,\nJustice Scalia, of a difference in value, and of course\nthe pre-emption -- the issue here is not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Answer my question. Did\nthey charge more for light cigarettes?\nMR. FREDERICK: They did not charge more for\nlight cigarettes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So what are your damages?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, what's the difference\nin value?\nMR. FREDERICK: Economists have projected\nthat if a person would have quit smoking and, therefore,\nnot purchased light cigarettes or would have paid a\ndifferent amount of money thinking it was getting a\nsafer cigarette, there is an economic value --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why would the person have\ndecided to quit or not to quit? The person would have\nmade that decision based upon the health consequences.\nMR. FREDERICK: Certainly. And the point\nhere about the advertising --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So -- you are proving a\npoint which depends upon the relationship between\nsmoking and health.\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Souter, I don't\nthink that the liability requirement here, the rule of\nlaw that is being imposed under Bates -- what Bates said\nwas that you look at the elements of the claim to\ndetermine whether or not the requirements are imposed by\nState law. The requirement that we seek to impose here\nis the duty not to deceive --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why couldn't you say\nexactly the same thing about a State mode seeks to\nprotect consumers, and they have a -- they have a rule,\nand the rule is not only the cigarette company do you\nhave to say cigarettes are dangerous to your health, you\nhave to put skull and crossbones? That's the state law.\nAnd you say why? They say because we are\ntrying to protect consumers. And then you would be up\nhere saying, they are not trying -- the duty there is\nnot the duty to put the skull and crossbones. It's the\nduty to protect consumers.\nNow, that argument would get nowhere, as you\nunderstand. And they are saying you're making just that\nkind of argument here, except substitute the word\n\"deception\".\nMR. FREDERICK: We are not making the same\nargument here for two reasons: One is that the main\nstatute is not specially targeted at cigarette smoking.\nIt's specially targeted at deception in the marketplace.\nUnder your hypothetical it would be specially targeted\nat cigarette companies. Under Reilly that would be\npreempted.\nSecondly, skull and crossbones I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me before you go. I\ndon't understand that. It is not specially targeted at\ncigarettes and at the harmful health effects of\ncigarettes?\nMR. FREDERICK: The statute we seek to\ninvoke is a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a general statute but\nin Riegel we -- we took a general statute and looked at\nwhat its specific application in the case was.\nMR. FREDERICK: Because the statute --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can't get away with\njust coming in and saying the general statute is an\nanti-deception statute. Didn't we look at what the\napplication of it was in the case?\nMR. FREDERICK: You looked at it because the\nstatute required you to look at it as applicable, and\nthe purposes behind that Act were to give the FDA\nauthority at the premarketing -- and purposes behind the\nmedical device amendment were completely different. The\nFTC does not look at these marketing materials before\nthe cigarette companies do that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what I want you to\nget you to talk about just for me for 30 seconds. I\ncan't deal with this conceptual thing. It was hard for\nme to see it conceptually. I can't understand -- and\nthat may be enough to any other person here, but I can't\nunderstand somebody saying yes, this language is very\nabsolute but it doesn't mean to cover everything that it\nliterally applies to. For example, it probably doesn't\ncover a requirement about workers smoking who put up\nbillboards. And another thing you say it doesn't cover\nis traditional anti-deception law. That would have to\ndo with the purpose of the statute not the text.\nI'm not making your argument for you. I'm\ngiving you an introduction, and I want you to give 30\nseconds dealing with the purposes that either says there\nis something to that line or there isn't.\nMR. FREDERICK: Prior to the enactment of\nthe 1969 Labeling Act, Congress confronted the spectra\nof states imposing warning requirements. And the\ntobacco companies went to Congress and said, we do not\nwant special burdens imposed on us. We don't want\nspecial advantages, but please don't impose special\nburdens on the cigarette industry.\nAnd Congress said, we will wipe away the\nprospect of state imposing warnings by having a\ncongressionally mandated warning on the cigarette packs\nand in cigarette advertising. The Congress said nothing\nabout having anti-deception laws be displaced by States.\nSo that in, in the hair hypo that you gave,\nI think Mr. Olson would have to acknowledge that the\ncigarette companies were not asking at the time of the\n'69 Labeling Act to be free of anti-deception laws.\nThey had been out for decades saying cigarette smoking\ncures the common cold, it makes the throat feel better,\nall sorts of health-related claims that were deceptive.\nAnd Congress was not trying to wipe that away.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Frederick, did I\nunderstand you earlier to say that your complaint did\nnot seek injunctive relief?\nMR. FREDERICK: We are not here seeking\ninjunctive relief for this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Page 42A of your\namended complaint says you ask the Court to grant such\ninjunctive relief as may be appropriate.\nMR. FREDERICK: I misspoke, Mr. Chief\nJustice, with apologies to the Court. Our claim here,\nthough, principally is for damages. And I would also\npoint out that any injunction that would have been\nordered here would be superseded by the United States\nRICO case, where the District Court of the District of\nColumbia has already issued an injunction for the use of\nlight cigarettes because Judge Kessler found in more\nthan 4,000 findings of fact that Philip Morris had\nengaged in deception in the marketplace and findings of\nfact, beginning 2023 and following --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, are you\nsaying that the consent decree -- because we have\novertaken Judge Kessler's decision by consent decree,\nright and it has terms? Does a -- does a consent decree\nterms allow state attorney generals to say don't\nadvertise low?\nMR. FREDERICK: The consent decree in the\nmaster settlement agreement does not address itself to\nspecific issues with regard to light and low tar, to my\nknowledge. The Kessler order does address the deception\nby lights and low tar, and the reason is temporal.\nWhen the master settlement agreement was\nentered into in the late '90s, the tobacco companies had\nnot yet acknowledged publicly that they had been engaged\nin deception with respect to studies regarding low tar\nand light cigarette. That came to light in 2002, and as\na result of the discovery that occurred in the\ngovernment's case and in State cases, the studies that\nthe cigarette companies knew for decades that there was\nno difference in the yield for low tar and light\ncigarettes came to light.\nAnd so, the master settlement agreement was\nnot -- it had certain provisions about the way\ncigarettes could be marketed but -- but the Judge\nKessler opinion, in the government's RICO case, actually\nmakes findings of fact on this score. And the complaint\nhere essentially tracks the allegations in the\ngovernment's. All we seek to do is to provide a remedy\nto consumers that have been defrauded by Philip Morris\nover these many decades.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could a state attorney\ngeneral say under my authority to check against false\nand deceptive advertising, no cigarette company can\nadvertise in this State low or light?\nMR. FREDERICK: I think that would fall into\nthe Reilly line of being preempted, because it would be\nspecially targeted and there would be no room for a\ncigarette maker to say truthfully our product actually\ndoes yield lower and light. So, it could not be a\nrequirement based on deception. It would have to be a\nrequirement based on smoking and health under your\nhypothetical.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Weren't the claims that were\nheld to be preempted in Cipollone based on general\ncommon law duties?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, they were. Those --\nthe fraudulent neutralization of warning claim and the\nfailure to warn claim were common law claims, Justice\nAlito, but the difference here is that in Cipollone the\nplurality plus the three Justices who joined Justice\nBlackmun's opinion and would have found no common law\nclaims preempted. Seven Justices found fraud claims\nthat are virtually identical to ours not to be preempted\nbecause Congress lacked any intent to displace State\nlaws concerning deception.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Frederick, if I take\naway from your oral argument that it is your position\nthat this suit is not based on a link between smoking\nand health, I'm going to have difficulty in accepting\nyour position in this entire case. Do you have a\nsecondary position that it is based on a link between\nsmoking and health but it is subject to a general duty,\nthat is, that supersedes or is quite in addition to\nlabeling?\nMR. FREDERICK: The requirement is what I\nwould urge you to focus on, Justice Kennedy. And the\nrequirement that is being imposed here is not a\nrequirement that has to do specifically with smoking and\nhealth.\nThere is a second argument, which is that\neven under the application of that generalized duty, the\njury here or the trial court would not be asked to look\nat the linkage between smoking and health. It could\nsimply say, have a scientist up there who says the yield\nof a light cigarette is no different than the yield of a\nregular cigarette.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do I understand your basic\nargument to be that this statute is a prohibition\nagainst State warnings in either promotion or\nadvertising different from the Federal one?\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct. That was\nthe general purpose of the statute. There is language,\nof course, that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: This specific quotation\ndeals only with the contents of the advertising that\nmight be described as warnings different from those in\nthe Federal scheme.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's absolutely correct,\nJustice Stevens. And here what we are talking about\nwith these light descriptors are comparisons between two\nproducts that, in fact, are not different.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your answer to Justice\nGinsburg's question was that the state attorney general\ncould not impose a regulation that said you must say\nthat low tar cigarettes have as much nicotine as regular\ncigarettes. If the attorney general couldn't do that,\nwhy could the plaintiff do it in his lawsuit?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, the attorney general\ncould bring the same suit that we bring here, Justice\nKennedy. The difference is between a --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. The hypothetical was\nthe attorney general requires this as a regulation under\nhis authority.\nMR. FREDERICK: And let me answer the\nhypothetical this way: The attorney general can bring\nthe lawsuit under the State deceptive practices act but\ncannot issue a generalized regulation targeted at the\ncigarette industry that takes truth completely out of\nthe equation, because if another cigarette company comes\nup and says, \"We actually have a light cigarette that is\nlower in tar,\" and we can prove it --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose he wins the\nlawsuit -- he wins the lawsuit that it's false and\ndeceptive to say \"low.\" Could he then have a regulation\nthat says cigarette companies don't advertise \"low\" or\n\"light\"?\nMR. FREDERICK: I think that's a much more\ndifficult hypo, but I think the answer is the same and\nthat would be no, because a regulation would be -- would\nbe specifically targeted at the industry and it would be\nbased on smoking and health, not deception.\nIn an injunctive situation, adjudicatory\nfacts can evolve. A company can come forward and say\nthe facts have changed, circumstances have changed,\nplease modify the injunction. That can't happen when a\ngeneralized regulation is imposed that is specifically\ntargeted at facts regardless of their truth or veracity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, can you make that\nconcrete? What would change about the label \"low\" or\n\"light\"?\nMR. FREDERICK: If the -- if the company\ncame forward and said, \"we redesigned our cigarette,\"\nand it in fact does yield less tar and nicotine under a\nscientifically verifiable test, that would be -- that\nwould run afoul of the regulation, but it would not run\nafoul of the general duty not to deceive.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Frederick.\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:\nMr. Hallward-Driemeier.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It will not surprise\nyou that my first question is, why did the United States\nnot address the express pre-emption argument and,\nsecond, what is the position of the United States on the\nexpress pre-emption argument?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Your Honor, the\nUnited States did not participate on the question of the\nscope of the express pre-emption provision in Cipollone,\nand to a large extent the express pre-emption question\nin this case is what was the meaning of the decision in\nCipollone. And so that is of less interest to the\nUnited States than certainly the second question\npresented, which has to do with the FTC's own authority\nand its exercise of that authority.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. Well,\nthat's why you didn't address it. Now, what is the\nposition of the United States? It's a statute that is\ndirected to an area in which the Federal Government has\nan extensive interest in regulation, and I would have\nthought there'd be a position on that. It is logically\nantecedent to the implied pre-emption. You would\nconsider whether there is express pre-emption before\nimplied pre-emption.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Your Honor, the\nUnited States has not taken a position on the bottom\nline of the first question presented.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Petitioner says you have in\nan earlier case.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I don't believe\nthat the position that the United States stated in\nReilly is dispositive of the first question presented in\nthis case. But, again, that doesn't mean that the brief\nthat the United States has filed with respect to implied\npre-emption is not relevant.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's not\nanymore. I understood -- I understood Mr. Olson to give\nup on implied pre-emption in his opening argument.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Implied pre-emption\nis all that you address, right?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: But we --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it should be\npretty easy for you to win on that.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I would hope so.\nThank you.\nBut we also address a question that is\ncommon to the two questions presented, and that is an\nargument that the Petitioners make with respect to\nimplied pre-emption, but they also make it with respect\nto express pre-emption, and that is -- and, Justice\nGinsburg --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does the FTC at this point\nin 2008 have an opinion about whether the tar and\nnicotine figures that are produced by this testing\nmethod are meaningful or misleading?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, as Your Honor\nis aware, we submitted a -- a supplemental authority\nletter that in July of this year the Commission issued a\nrequest for comment on a proposal to rescind its\nguidance with respect to the tar and nicotine test\nresults, precisely because of concern that they are\nmisleading due to the evidence that has developed about\nthe incidence of compensation. That was not believed at\nthe time that the Commission issued its guidance back in\n1966 and '67 to present a significant problem. But it\nis evident now. The scientific community indicates and\ncertainly the findings of fact in the RICO case are that\nthe -- that the tobacco companies have known since 1967\nthat in fact compensation is nearly complete, and for\nthat reason, the tar and nicotine yields via the\nCambridge test method are not indicative of the yield to\na true human smoker. And for that reason, it proposed\nto withdraw.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would it be -- would it be\nunfair to say that for quite sometime now, nearly 40\nyears, the FTC has passively approved the placement of\nthese tar and nicotine figures in advertisement?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: With respect to the\n-- I want first to take issue with the question of\n\"approved,\" because I think that it -- it draws an\nanalogy to the FDA context, to Riegel and the like, and\nthat is not the nature of what the Federal Trade\nCommission does. It doesn't stand --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, you passed a rule to\nrequire it, did you not?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: We proposed a rule\nto require the disclosure of tar and nicotine --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And you withdrew that after\nthe companies voluntarily agreed to place the\ninformation on the ads --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- and entered into consent\ndecrees with other companies requiring them to put\ninformation in their ads.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No. The consent\ndecrees did not require them to put the information in\ntheir ads. It said that it would be deceptive to make\nclaims about the tar and nicotine content of the\ncigarettes without expressing, in milligrams, what the\nyield was per the Cambridge test method. But that's a\nvery different thing. It's a prohibition. They were\nordered to cease and desist making claims about tar and\nnicotine content without giving the consumer the benefit\nof the yield figures. But the Commission has never --\nspecifically at issue in this case are the descriptors\n\"light\" or \"lower in tar.\" In 1987, the Commission\nissued a notice in which it said these terms are are not\ndefined by Federal law. They asked whether there should\nbe --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Was there a different\nbetween saying \"light\" and saying \"lower in tar\" in\naccordance with the Cambridge testing method?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes, Your Honor,\nbecause the -- the \"light,\" on its own, much more\nconveys the impression to the consumer that this is the\nyield to the consumer himself, the actual human smoker,\nand in fact that was why the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: The FTC's position seems to\nme incomprehensible. If these figures are meaningless,\nthen you should have prohibited them -- are misleading,\nyou should have prohibited them a long time ago. And\nyou've created this whole problem by, I think, passively\napproving the placement of these figures on the -- on --\nin the advertisements. And if they are misleading, then\nyou have misled everybody who's bought those cigarette\nfor a long time.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: They -- whether\nthey are or are not misleading depends upon the\nincidence of compensation. At the time the Commission\nissued its guidance in 1966 and '67, the HEW report was\nthat compensation was not expected to be a problem. It\nwas not believed to be a problem. Beginning in 1983,\nwhen in light of the Barclay's case in which it was\ndetermined that a particular cigarette, the yield\naccording to the test method had nothing to do with\nyield to an actual consumer, the FTC started to inquire\nabout this.\nBut the Petitioners, although they have\nknown since 1967 about the incidence of compensation,\nfailed to disclose that information to the Commission.\nThey have failed to -- they have refused to give them\nthe benefit of their insights, their own studies. The\nCommission has asked --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Commission -- when did\nthe Commission know of this stuff? I had a case when I\nwas on the Court of Appeals, so it had to be before 1984\ninvolving so-called lip drape --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: You're right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- by which the smoker\ncovers up the little holes that bring in some fresh air.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: In 1978 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's been general knowledge\nfor a long time, and the FTC has done nothing about it.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: There has been a\nquestion. In 1978, the Commission issued a notice\nrequesting comment about whether lip drape in fact\noccluded the holes that dilute the concentration of the\nair, and the tobacco companies did not respond to that,\neven though they had their own studies showing that it\nwas a problem. So it is -- it is true that the\nCommission has only now issued the notice proposing to\nwithdraw its earlier guidance; but the Petitioners\nthemselves should not be able to benefit from their own\nmisleading of the Commission.\nBut again, I think it's more fundamental\nthan that, is that their arguments rely upon a\nmisconception of what the Commission does. As Justice\nSouter noted, it is Supreme Court law the Commission\ndoes not supplant State law; it acts cooperatively with\nState law. The Commission does not act as a gatekeeper\nlike FDA in approving things. It acts as a law\nenforcement agency. It goes after fraud when it is\naware of it. But that is not to the exclusion of State\nlaw enforcement agencies or other Federal law\nenforcement agencies.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask a question? I\nplan to go back and see what the Government said in\nthe -- in the case that Petitioner asserts you have\neffectively supported his position on -- on express\npre-emption. I plan to go back and read it. Assuming I\nagree with him rather than you, has the government's\nposition changed from what it was then? As far as you\nknow, is the government's position still the same, the\nposition that you delicately did not bring to our\nattention?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is in the Reilly\ncase.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The Reilly case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. In Reilly. I haven't\nread the brief there, I must say. But suppose I agree\nwith Petitioner. Can I assume --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Of course --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And do you assume that it's\n--\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The position of the\nUnited States as stated in the Reilly case was that the\nexpress guarantee provision did not pre-empt a\nregulation of the nature in that case. It was our\nposition that that, because it was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm not asking about --\nI'll figure that out on my own. Trust me. I can\nprobably figure that out. But once I have figured it\nout, can I assume that that is still the government's\nposition --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- whatever it is?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I would think\nthat we would need to revisit the question in light of\nthis Court's holding in Reilly, in light of the\nadditional precedents that there have been over the last\ndecade or whatever it's been since that decision was\nissued. So --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have no idea which\ndirection that would lead?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: We have not taken a\nposition on the first -- on the bottom line of the first\nquestion presented. Although as I say --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm going to hold you to\nyour last position, just -- just for fun.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Olson, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nWe haven't given up the implied pre-emption argument,\nbut I --\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You just didn't want\nto argue it.\nMR. OLSON: I -- we feel that we explained\nit very thoroughly in our briefs, and I thought knowing\nthat the time was limited I thought we should focus on\nthe strongest argument I think by any stretch of the\nimagination, when Congress has spoken directly.\nNow, first of all, with respect to what the\nSolicitor General on behalf of the United States says,\nand this is in response to the point that Justice Scalia\nwas just addressing -- page 1 of the Reilly brief, the\nAttorney General is responsible for enforcing the\nLabeling Act. So it is the government's responsibility,\naccording to them, to enforce the Labeling Act.\nThen on pages 8 and 9 of their brief,\ndistinguishing between the location of the billboards in\nthat case and other things that would be pre-empted,\npages 8 and 9, the Government said the Labeling Act\npreempts State laws concerning the content of cigarette\nadvertising with respect to smoking and health. And the\nActing Solicitor General on page 25 of the transcript of\nthe argument that day in this case was asked that\nquestion, what is pre-empted? And she said it pre-empts\nState law claims about filters or the safety of a\nparticular cigarette. That is this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Isn't the point, it doesn't\npre-empt rules about location; it pre-empts rules about\ncontent?\nMR. OLSON: That was the government's point.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the government's\nposition. Now, if that's their position, isn't it just\none additional step to say depending on what the history\nof the statute is, that it pre-empts regulations about\ncontent that don't have to do with lying about the\ncontent?\nMR. OLSON: It has to do according to what\nCongress said about the content of the advertising and\nthe promotion of cigarettes; that's what this case is\nabout when it has to do with smoking and health.\nNow, my opponent seems to run away, in\nanswer to your question, about what if we take out\nsmoking and health from their complaint? Well, they\ncan't take out smoking. That is everywhere in the\ncomplaint. I asked the Court to sit down and compare\nthe labeling statute with the complaint. And the words\nare indistinguishable, and they say over and over again\nand on page 4A of -- then Mr. Frederick's saying well,\nall they want is economic damages. They are really\nnot -- they are just concerned about they got one\ncigarette and they wanted to get another cigarette.\nPage 4A, this is the way the Court of Appeals understood\nit. This is page 4A of the petition appendix: the\nplaintiffs explain that the relative levels of these\nsubstances bear on a reasonable consumer's decision on\nwhich cigarette to purchase, because consumers\nunderstand that reducing the quantities of tar and\nnicotine in cigarettes reduces their adverse health\neffects. That is what this case is all about.\nNow, I will just conclude in this way. The\nstatute in the language of this Court in the Reilly\ncase, uses \"sweeping language.\" The language is every\nbit as sweeping as the language in the airline\nderegulation act that uses the phrase relates to, I\nsubmit.\nSo there is three requirements. Either --\nthe statute prohibits, any and it uses the phrase \"any,\"\nyou can't get more expansive than that; and it uses the\nword \"no\" requirements or prohibition. The Court has\ndealt with requirements and prohibition in Reilly,\nCipollone, Bates, Wolens, Riegel. The statute that we\nare talking about here in this case is the same statute\nessentially that it was dealing with in Reilly. It's\nthe State Unfair Practices Act. It was\nMassachusetts/Maine; but I compared the statutes side by\nside. They essentially the same.\nIs the requirement based upon smoking and\nhealth? Well, the complaint specifically says so. The\nrelief is based upon the relationship between smoking\nand health and is it in promotion or advertising of\ntobacco? Again, they've said that over and over again.\nI submit that the statute could not be more clear. This\nparticular complaint seeks to impose a regulation --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it correct that your\nargument requires us to reject the fraud analysis in\nCipollone?\nMR. OLSON: Yes. I believe it does.\nHowever, Justice Stevens, I believe when you talked\nabout in that -- the plurality opinion, you talked about\nminimizing, reducing, negating the effect of the warning\nlabels. That's also this complaint. This as a\ncomplaint is identical so what you were referring to on\npage 527 of Cipollone.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
