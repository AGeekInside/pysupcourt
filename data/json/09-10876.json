        "content": "(10:15 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument first this morning in Case 09-10876,\nBullcoming v. New Mexico.\nMr. Fisher.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe text, purpose, and history of the\nConfrontation Clause make it clear that the prosecution\ncannot introduce one person's testimonial statements\nthrough the in-court testimony of someone else. Thus,\nhaving held in Melendez-Diaz that a lab analyst's\nstatements in a forensic lab report are testimonial,\nthis is an easy case.\nThe State violated the Confrontation Clause\nby introducing lab analyst Curtis Caylor's statements in\na forensic lab report without putting him on the stand.\nThe New Mexico Supreme Court resisted this analysis,\nstraightforward as it is, on the ground that\nMr. Bullcoming, as the defendant, had the opportunity to\ncross-examine a substitute or a surrogate witness,\nMr. Razatos.\nBut a surrogate witness procedure violates\nall four components of the right to confrontation. It\nquite obviously violates the defendant's right to have\nthe witness testify in his presence, in the presence of\nthe jury so the jury can observe it, and under oath, as\nhappened in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher, when you say\n\"in the presence,\" do you -- do you mean it necessarily\nmust be in the courtroom, or would a video-conferencing\nset-up be permissible so that the technician or the\nanalyst could testify from the lab, rather -- but it\nwould be screened in -- in the courthouse?\nMR. FISHER: Well, the default rule under\nthe Confrontation Clause is in presence, in the\ncourtroom. Now, in Maryland v. Craig, this Court held\nin a child witness setting -- of course, very different\nthan this case -- that closed-circuit TV would be\npermissible, and I believe, you know, in a future case,\nif the State perhaps made some sort of showing that the\nlab analyst couldn't come to court for some reason, and\ncertainly if the defendant stipulated, and maybe even if\nthe defendant didn't stipulate, a court could\naccommodate -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The defendant didn't give\nhis consent, so we don't -- that's not a concern, but\nlet's -- let's suppose defendant doesn't stipulate. Is\nthis adequate to meet the Confrontation Clause?\nMR. FISHER: I don't think it would be\nadequate, Justice Ginsburg, with at least some -- absent\nat least some showing of unavailability of the witness\nor -- making the witness unable to come to court.\nNow -- now, there is an amicus brief in the\ncase, I believe, that suggests some flexibility that\ntrial judges might employ in -- in accommodating lab\nanalysts' schedules.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about police\nwitnesses? What about not requiring the officer who -\nwho took the confession or who witnessed the alleged\ncrime -- not requiring him to appear because he's busy?\nMR. FISHER: Well, that's never been -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can't make it. He's out on\nthe beat. So can we have him appear by television?\nMR. FISHER: That's never been the rule,\nJustice Scalia, and I don't think there would be a need\nto -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why is a lab\ntechnician different?\nMR. FISHER: I don't think -- I don't think\none is, and you don't have to reach that in this case,\nbecause the State never attempted to make any showing\nthat Mr. Caylor was unavailable for any reason. This -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Fisher, what if\nyou had two people doing this procedure? They're\nsitting in, you know, chairs right next to the other.\nThe one, you know, takes the blood samples from the\nvials, puts them in another vial, and puts the aluminum\nstuff on and crimps it. The other one then takes the\nvials and puts them in the machine and runs it. Do you\nhave to have both of them testify?\nMR. FISHER: Only if the State wants to\npresent statements from them both.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, they want to -\nMR. FISHER: They both -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They want to present\nthe results of the blood analysis -\nMR. FISHER: I think -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the numbers the\nmachine spits out.\nMR. FISHER: I think in that scenario, if\nboth people were there for the whole thing, the State\ncould have either one of them testify. What the State\ncouldn't do -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though one -\nMR. FISHER: -- and this is the rule -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though one\ndidn't do it? Even though the question is going to be,\ndid you put the aluminum on and crimp it, and the answer\nis going to be, no, Joe did it; he sits right next to\nme?\nMR. FISHER: That's right. The\nConfrontation Clause is a purely procedural right, Mr.\nChief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. That's\nright. Does -- do they both have to testify, then, or\nnot?\nMR. FISHER: They do not have to. The\nConfrontation Clause is a purely procedural right. It\nall depends on what -- whose statements the State wants\nto introduce. So, if the State is satisfied to prove\nits case by having somebody testify, saying, I watched\nthe thing go into the machine and I watched this result\ncome out and I saw that it wasn't tampered with and it\nwas Mr. Bullcoming's sample, then that would be fine.\nAnd in fact, what some labs do -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I don't understand\nthat. How is that any different than the supervisor of\nthe lab saying, I know what these people do, I -- I\nwatch them on a day-to-day basis, and they perform their\nwork correctly?\nMR. FISHER: Again, the question, Justice\nKennedy, is not who the State has to bring in. The\nquestion is whose statements the State wants to\nintroduce. Here, the State wanted to introduce\nMr. Caylor's statements, and so it therefore needs to -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What the State wanted to\nintroduce is the result of the exam, and the Chief\nJustice gives you the hypothetical. Say, two people are\nnecessary for the exam. You say only one has to be\nthere if both saw it?\nMR. FISHER: If only -- if the State is only\nintroducing one person -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it -- but it's hearsay\nas to what the first person did with -- with crimping -\nMR. FISHER: I don't -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- crimping the thing.\nIt's not direct testimony from that person. You didn't\nsay, are you experienced in crimping? Did you use your\nright hand or your left hand? Is there a danger of\nspillage? And so on. All that is beyond the ability of\nthe defense to ask.\nMR. FISHER: No, I -- Justice Kennedy, I\ndon't think it's hearsay. It's simply being an\neyewitness and saying: Here's what I watched. I\nwatched this person put it into the machine, and this is\nthe result that I saw come out.\nNow, again, the only question is whose\nstatements the State wants to introduce. By all means,\nMr. Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy, if the State\nwanted to introduce statements from both of the lab\nanalysts who worked together on the case, they would\nneed to bring them both in, but if they only want to\nintroduce one lab -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The State takes its\nchances, right? I mean, as to how much it has to bring\nin, in order to persuade the jury?\nMR. FISHER: That's right. That's the\ndecision the State makes in every case, whether it be\nmultiple police investigators, multiple eyewitnesses,\nor -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You always take your\nchances with a business record. That's a given, of\ncourse. Of course, the State takes a chance with the -\nwith the admission of any admissible hearsay testimony\nthat the jury will be -- that you'll make the argument\nto the jury that you should discount it if the person\nisn't there. That's always true.\nMR. FISHER: I'm not sure I -- I disagree\nwith anything you said, but the rule of the\nConfrontation Clause applies to a particular kind of\nstatements, testimonial statements. And our rule today\nand the one that resolves this case is, if the State\nwants to introduce a witness's testimonial statements,\nit needs to bring that witness to court.\nNow, footnote 1 in Melendez-Diaz -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, I take it it's a\ntestimonial statement that this blood that was taken at\nthe hospital was the blood of the defendant. That's a\ntestimonial statement?\nMR. FISHER: Yes, I believe it would be,\nJustice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And so I assume that in\nthis case, the nurse and the police officer were both\npresent.\nMR. FISHER: Yes, and, in fact -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I assume under your\nposition, you could not have a record showing that\nthe -- the nurse withdrew the sample at 10:08 p.m. on\nsuch-and-such a date and that she followed the regular\nprocedure. That would be insufficient if the State\nwanted to introduce just a certificate or just -- just\nthat record?\nMR. FISHER: I think that's what footnote 1\nin Melendez-Diaz says. If the defendant wants to\nchallenge the chain of custody, then the State needs to\nbring in the witnesses. Now, I think it's an\ninteresting fact in this case, and it shows why that\nrule isn't so -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's not -- I don't\nthink that's what Melendez-Diaz' footnote 1 says. It\nsays that the State may be able to prove chain of\ncustody by testimony other than the actual individuals\nwho handled the sample, and then it has to take its\nchances as to whether the trier of fact is going to\nbelieve -- is going to believe that. Isn't that right?\nMR. FISHER: I think that's right. I think\nwhat footnote 1 says is the defendant -- when the State\nchooses whose testimony it wants to introduce, the\ndefendant has the right to insist that that be done\nlive.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It does -- it does not -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does not Melendez-Diaz also\nsay that if the defendant wants to challenge the -- the\nchain of custody, the State can adopt rules that\nrequires the defendant to assert that challenge or his\nintention to make that challenge, or his intention to\nmake that challenge, prior to the trial so that the\nState will know whether it has to introduce any live\ntestimony?\nMR. FISHER: Of course, that's correct under\nthe notice and demand regimes that Melendez-Diaz\napproved of. And the Public -- the PDS brief in this\ncase showed that many States do use those regimes. Now,\nJustice Kennedy, I did want to -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the chain -- the chain\nof custody does involve a testimonial statement that\nthis is the blood, that I took it out at 10:05 p.m. on\nSaturday evening. That's a testimonial statement. It's\nthe defendant's blood.\nMR. FISHER: Yes, it can, Justice Kennedy,\nbut chain of custody is proved by live witnesses every\nday in -- every day in courtrooms across the country -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it's not just -\nMR. FISHER: -- long before Melendez-Diaz or\nCrawford.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not just chain of\ncustody. I think the Chief Justice is trying to get at\nthis problem, or I am: Lab technician Jones looks at a\nvial, and it's blue. She says to Smith, \"it's blue.\"\nSmith turns a lever on a machine to B.\nJason sees the B and goes into court -- you\nmake him go into court; that's our case. And what I\nwonder is, is the defendant now entitled to the\nfollowing instruction: Jury, because he's in court, he\ncan say that the machine read B, but that proves nothing\nabout the vial, nothing. All it proves is what someone\nsaid in the laboratory to another person, and those two\npeople aren't in court.\nNow, that's -- you see, that's the problem,\nI think, of the intermediate step. I'd either like to\nbe told I'm wrong about that, you don't have to have\nthem, or explain whatever you'd like.\nMR. FISHER: If I understand your\nhypothetical correctly, I think that if the defendant\nwanted -- the defendant can certainly make that argument\nto a jury, and the defendant, if he wanted to insist -\nif the prosecution wanted to tie the results -- let's\nbring it back to the facts of this case -- wanted to tie\nthe .21 to Mr. Bullcoming by saying that was\nMr. Bullcoming's sample, then they'd need to bring\nsomebody into court if the defendant insisted upon it.\nBut the one thing I want to add is that the\nPublic Defender Service brief makes clear, and the facts\nof this case make clear, it's going to be very rare that\na defendant wants to do that. The defendant in this\ncase wanted to stipulate to the nurse's blood draw and\nthat it was his blood that was drawn in the hospital.\nIt was the State that insisted on putting her on the\nstand. It happens in courtrooms all across the country.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but if you want to\ntell us, don't worry, it won't happen, I think that's an\nunacceptable argument. You're saying the defense has\ncertain rights, and we have to presume there is a\ndefense attorney who's going to afford his client every\nright the Constitution has. So the fact that we're not\nsupposed to worry because it won't happen very often is\n(a) it seems to me, an unlikely hypothetical; and (b) it\nseems to me, irrelevant to your argument.\nMR. FISHER: Well, Justice Kennedy, I will\ngladly accept (b) if we want to say that consequences\nare irrelevant, because I think that's what -- the Sixth\nAmendment is what it is, but I think the only thing I\nwould add is that all I can say is, empirically, in the\nStates that have followed the rule we advocate today,\nlong before Crawford or Melendez-Diaz, it simply is a\nmanageable burden. I'm not saying it's no burden. But\nit is a thoroughly manageable -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Fisher, I thought -- I\nthought the Court put this worry behind us in Crawford.\nWasn't the same worry raised in Crawford?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think it was raised\neven more pointedly in Melendez-Diaz when it comes to\nlab analysts. I think in both places the Court, yes,\nset that aside.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Said, yes, it may be\nsomething of a risk, but the States have managed it in\nthe past, and there's no reason to think they can't\nmanage it in the future.\nMR. FISHER: I think that's what\nMelendez-Diaz -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there are\ndifferent types of hearsay involved here or different\ntypes of statements. There's the report itself, which\nwas Exhibit 1 that was introduced, and it has certain\ncertifications by the analyst, that he followed certain\nprocedures, et cetera. I'm assuming that you're\nclaiming that those -- those are the Confrontation\nClause violations, that exhibit itself, because it is\nattesting or certifying to something.\nMR. FISHER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The witness is not at\ntrial here.\nMR. FISHER: Yes, Mr. Caylor's\ncertifications in this -- in the lab report, not only\nthat the blood -- that the blood had a .21 blood alcohol\ncontent, but also that -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's where I\nwant -\nMR. FISHER: Oh, but -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That -- the \"also\" is\nwhat I summarized in saying that he followed certain\nprocedures, that it was in accordance with law, et\ncetera.\nMR. FISHER: And also that it was\nMr. Bullcoming's blood sample and that the sample had\nnot been tampered with.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right.\nMR. FISHER: That's the totality of the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But as to those persons\nwho -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now -- if I might just\nfinish my question.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Okay. Go ahead. Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume that the\nraw data, the graphs that were made, were reviewed by a\nseparate witness, and he reviewed the data and says,\nthis data shows that the blood level concentration was\n.21, or two-point whatever it was. Would that violate\nthe Confrontation Clause, using the raw data itself?\nMR. FISHER: I want to be clear that raw -\nby \"raw data,\" you mean the printout from a machine?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The printout from the\nmachine.\nMR. FISHER: It's used a few different ways\nin the briefing.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That wasn't introduced\nhere; am I correct?\nMR. FISHER: It was neither -- it was not\nintroduced, and there's nothing in the record to show\nthat Mr. Razatos even reviewed it.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. But let's\nassume -\nMR. FISHER: So what he did is just read the\nreport.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume he just\ntook the raw data at trial. I know we now have a chain\nof custody, and someone will have to prove that this is\nthe data related -\nMR. FISHER: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to Mr. Bullcoming.\nBut if that expert then read that data and testified\nthat this was of a certain amount or percentage of\nalcohol, would that violate the Confrontation Clause?\nMR. FISHER: Probably not. Provided, as you\nsay, the chain of custody had been either properly\nproved or stipulated to, I think an expert could take\nthe stand and say, I'm looking at a graph, and here's\nwhat the graph shows me. Now, you might get into -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's what -- that's\nthe New Mexico Supreme Court suggested, didn't they?\nThey said bring the printout from the gas -- whatever -\nchromatograph, and then have an expert who was not the\none who certified -- it was not Caylor -- but that\nhere's the graph that came out of the machine, and this\nis the way this process operates.\nI -- in your answer to Justice Sotomayor,\ndid you mean to agree with the New Mexico Supreme Court\nwhen they said printout plus an analyst who didn't do\nthis particular run but knows how the process works?\nMR. FISHER: No, Justice Ginsburg. I'm\ncertainly not here today to agree with the New Mexico\nSupreme Court. What they said doesn't -- doesn't make\nany sense in this case because (a) the printout was\nnever introduced into evidence or looked at, and (b) it\nwould matter a great deal -- and this is how I continue\nmy answer. It mattered a great deal what was on the\nprintout. If the printout is nothing more than a graph,\nthen I don't think you can say that's a testimonial\nstatement. If a printout comes out of a machine that\nalso says at the top blood sample was Donald\nBullcoming's, here's the test that was run, et cetera,\nthose may well be testimonial statements that the\nanalyst triggered the machine to spit out.\nSo the Fourth Circuit has wrestled with this\nissue in the Washington case, and you can -- you can\nlook at the majority and the dissenting opinions in that\ncase. I think that the question would arise in that\nscenario, if the graphs were -- if the machine printouts\nwere introduced into evidence, the question would be,\nare the machine printouts testimonial? And to the\nextent they are, you'd have the same problem in this\ncase. To the extent they are not -- as the Fourth\nCircuit suggested, at least to some degree they may not\nbe -- then you don't have a -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What part -\nMR. FISHER: -- Confrontation Clause\nproblem.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What part do you see as\ntestimonial or not? What can an outside expert look at?\nMR. FISHER: I think an expert can look at\nanything. The only question is what's introduced into\nevidence. There's no -- there's no Confrontation\nClause -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I -- that -\nMR. FISHER: -- barring an expert from\nreviewing whatever he wants.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's two different\nissues: one, what can be introduced into evidence,\nwhich is the reports themselves; and what can he or she\ntestify to is a different question. That's a form of\nevidence. And so that's the line I'm trying to get you\nto describe for me, which is, when does that testimony\nbecome a violation of the Confrontation Clause?\nMR. FISHER: In one of two scenarios,\nJustice Sotomayor, the first which is the scenario we\nhave in this case, when the report is introduced and\nit's testimonial. The second -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume the\nhypothetical I proffered.\nMR. FISHER: The second is that it's not\nintroduced. Then you have a Confrontation Clause\nviolation if the expert -- and this is the words many\nlower courts have used -- is a mere conduit for\nintroducing the out-of-court testimonial statement.\nSo -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could we break this down in\n-- in this way? I see three things that the -- three\nstatements that the -- the State was attempting to -- to\nprove. The first was that the sample that was tested\nwas the sample that was taken from the defendant.\nSecond was that the standard procedures were followed in\nthis case, and the third was that the result was .21.\nWould you agree with that? Those are the three things?\nMR. FISHER: I think there's one other\nthing, Justice Alito, which is that the sample had not\nbeen tampered with -\nJUSTICE ALITO: All right.\nMR. FISHER: -- or contaminated.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That the sample had not been\ntampered with. Now, as to the first three, in other\nwords, everything other than the results, could the\nState prove those things without having -- simply by\nintroducing testimony regarding the way things were\ngenerally done in the lab, and ask the jury to infer\nthat the general procedures were followed in this\nparticular case?\nMR. FISHER: I think that would be a\nquestion of State law, Justice Alito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: It wouldn't be a\nConfrontation -\nMR. FISHER: It wouldn't be a Confrontation\nClause question.\nJUSTICE ALITO: All right. Now, in this\ncase, as I read the record, it seems to me that's what\nthe prosecutor was attempting to do. This is on page 50\nof the Joint Appendix. The analyst is beginning to\ntestify, the second answer on page 50: So what we do is\nwe will get the sample in the mail, et cetera.\nThe analyst is beginning to testify about\nstandard lab procedures, and then defense attorney says,\n\"Your Honor, I'm going to object to what's done in the\nstatus quo.\" I take that to mean what is generally\ndone. \"I don't object to what was done in this case.\"\nSo the defense attorney is preventing -- is\nobjecting to the prosecution's attempting to discharge\nits responsibility with respect to those first three\npropositions through testimony about standard\nprocedures, and is insisting that the analyst provide\nthe testimony that you say was a violation of the\nConfrontation Clause; namely, testifying as to what was\ndone in this particular case.\nMR. FISHER: Justice Alito, I think if you\nlook earlier in the Joint Appendix, I believe it's at\npage 40, where the State for the first time says we're\ngoing to put Mr. Razatos on the stand instead of Mr.\nCaylor, there's a -- there's an objection there as well\nthat says you can't then put the document into evidence\nthat Mr. Caylor wrote if he's not going to be on the\nstand. That's the critical objection here.\nNow, you're right, there's nothing wrong\nwith Mr. Razatos having taken the stand in this case,\nthere's nothing wrong with him having described typical\nprocedures in the lab. I think the objection you're\npointing was to the one that said -- again, as far as\nthe State law objection, saying he can't testify to\nsomething he doesn't have personal knowledge about,\nwhich is whether the procedures were followed in this\ncase. But Mr. -- Mr. Razatos could certainly take the\nstand and testify to -- to general procedures. But at\npage 54 and 55 of the Joint Appendix, he -- he simply\nreads the report's results.\nAnd so you have two Confrontation Clause\nviolations, really. You have the report being\nintroduced in the first instance, and then you have -- I\nbelieve it's at 54 and 55 of the Joint Appendix. You\nhave the prosecutor asking Mr. Razatos, what was the\nresult? He says the result was .21. As the State\nitself says at page 58, note 15 of its brief, there was\nno independent analysis being applied there. All Mr.\nRazatos was doing was repeating and giving the jury the\nconclusions that Mr. Caylor had reached.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But if the -- if the machine\nhad expelled a piece of paper that said .21, that piece\nof paper would not be a -- introduction of that piece of\npaper, the contents of the piece of paper, would not be\na violation of the Confrontation Clause?\nMR. FISHER: If it said nothing more than\nthe .21 coming out of the machine, I think probably not.\nNow, judge Michael in the First Circuit would disagree;\nand so that's an issue that's not in this case, and I\nthink you could debate whether that should -- even that\nshould be considered hearsay of the operator.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, how can -- how can you\ndebate it? The purpose of the Confrontation Clause is\nto allow cross-examination. How are you going to\ncross-examine the machine?\nMR. FISHER: Well -- well, the question that\nwould arise there would be whether the .21 should be\ntreated as Mr. Caylor's statement. Let me -- if I give\nyou two hypotheticals, maybe it explains. On the one\nhand, I don't think anyone would claim that a time stamp\non a fax machine, for example, is a human statement.\nIt's a machine statement, and so therefore it can't be\ntestimonial. On the other hand, if someone types out an\naffidavit on a word processor and hits print, you can't\nsay, well, that's the machine talking, not the human.\nSo the question arises in the lab context\nwhether a .21 or anything else that comes out of the\nmachine has enough human influence that it ought to be\ntreated as the -- as the person's statement.\nNow, you don't have to resolve that in this\ncase, and what's important to emphasize is that that\nhypothetical of the .21, even though the State would\nlike it to be this case, is really miles away for the\nreason you said, because the State proved a lot more\nthan .21 by Mr. Caylor's lab report, and that's why\nthese hypotheticals I think are important.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But all of those other\nthings could potentially be proven by indirect evidence,\nby establishing standard procedures and asking the jury\nto infer that the standard procedures were followed in\nthis case. They might -- they might believe that; they\nmight not -\nMR. FISHER: The State could -\nJUSTICE ALITO: They might make the\ninference; they might not.\nMR. FISHER: The State could make that\nchoice, but it would be a considerably weaker case,\nJustice Alito, not just because they wouldn't have\nanyone saying that the procedures were actually followed\nin this case, but also in this case it would be a far\nweaker case because they'd have somebody on the stand\nwho would now be subject to cross-examination as to why\nhe had been recently put on unpaid leave.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But as to this case, didn't\nthe defendant actually testify that he was drunk at the\ntime of -- at the time when the blood was extracted? He\ntook the stand and he testified that after the accident\nhe went off into the woods and he came upon people who\nwere drinking vodka and he drank, they drank -- what was\nit -- a gallon of vodka together, and then he went back\nto the scene and his blood was tested?\nMR. FISHER: That was -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that correct?\nMR. FISHER: That was his defense, Justice\nAlito, and here's why the lab report is still important,\nthough. Because you're right, he did admit he was\ndrunk. But remember, he was not convicted simply of\nDUI; he was convicted in New Mexico law of aggravated\nDUI. And to have aggravated DUI you need to have up to\na .16 blood alcohol count. So the report is the only\nthe State could have proved over .16, even if Mr.\nBullcoming admitted that he had been drinking that day.\nSo that's why it's important in this case.\nThat's why he wanted to challenge -- that's one reason\nwhy he wanted to challenge the report.\nLet me come back to the -- to the important\npoint, I think, though, that what the State wants to be\nable to do -- I don't want to ascribe a bad motive, but\nwhat the State's rule would allow States to do is to\ninsulate people from cross-examination, not just Mr.\nCaylor in this case, but -- but -- but please pay\nattention to, for example, the Dungo case that's cited\nin our opening brief, from California. That's a case\nwhere a coroner had been fired from his job, blacklisted\nby law enforcement, and prohibited from testifying in\nmany counties because he falsified his reports, his\nautopsy reports, by writing them with the police report\nsitting right next to him.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But the State can't -\nMR. FISHER: And -\nJUSTICE ALITO: The State can't immunize\nthose people from testifying. You could have subpoenaed\nCaylor, couldn't you? You could have asked for a\ncontinuance and -- and a subpoena, and brought him in to\ntestify? It's just a question of who has to take the\nstep, right?\nMR. FISHER: Well, we -- we could have, but\nMelendez-Diaz makes clear that doesn't satisfy the\nConfrontation Clause. And when you deal especially with\na garden variety DUI case there is only so much time and\nresources at issue, and that's why the Confrontation\nClause I think is especially important in a case like\nthis, that the prosecution bring its witnesses into\ncourt.\nAnd if I could just finish the Dungo story,\nin the -- in the California Court of Appeal, when they\nreviewed that case, they said the prosecutor's intent in\nthat case had been to shield Mr. -- I'm sorry, the -\nthe actual analyst in that case from cross-examination.\nAnd, in fact, the supervisor when he took the stand at\nthe preliminary hearing told -- told the court the\nreason why they have me here is the prosecutors find it\ntoo hard to have this person in court. So that would be\nperfectly permissible, if -- if the State win this case\ntoday and surrogate testimony were allowed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you answer the\npractical situation that Caylor, who did this particular\nrun, does some dozens day in and day out, and he will\nhave no memory, in fact, of this particular test. So\nhaving him there -- he knows how the process operates;\nhe doesn't remember this particular one -- how does\nhaving him there -- what could be elicited on\ncross-examination of him that couldn't be from his\nsupervisor?\nMR. FISHER: Let me give you two answers,\nJustice Ginsburg, but first let me say we don't know\nwhether somebody doesn't remember it until he's put on\nthe stand. What the NACDL brief says is that even\nthough analysts don't ordinary remember run-of-the-mill\ntests like this, that do remember if something went\nwrong or if something went haywire. So we don't know\nthat.\nBut assuming you're right that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wasn't it the case that\nthese tests are unusual in this particular jurisdiction?\nMR. FISHER: That's my understanding,\nJustice Scalia. So that's another reason why he may\nhave remembered.\nBut even if he didn't, there's two things\nthat could be importantly probed here. One is his\ncredibility. And I've explained why that was a very\nserious issue in this case, because he was put on unpaid\nleave.\nThe other is his competence. Again,\nMelendez-Diaz says it's important to have the person on\nthe stand to explain how he does his job, for the jury\nto observe his professionalism, for him to explain\nhere's my understanding of these procedures, et cetera.\nThat could be very important, and if I could leave you\nwith one thing before I -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume that even if\nhe doesn't remember, his testimony is not worthless to\nthe prosecution. He -- the prosecution can bring out\nhis high qualifications, and he can testify: It -- this\nis always the way I do it. I do it this way all the\ntime. I don't remember this particular incident.\nAll of that can be persuasive to the jury,\ncan't it?\nMR. FISHER: Of course, it can, Justice\nScalia. And on the flip side, even if he doesn't\nremember, cross-examination is very important.\nIf I could leave you with one thing that I\nthink isn't highlighted in the brief maybe the way it\nshould have been. There's a line of cases from this\nCourt, California v. Green, Delaware v. Fensterer, and\nUnited States v. Owens, that all hold that if a witness\ntakes the stand and doesn't remember anything, that the\nConfrontation Clause is still -- is still satisfied, as\nlong as that witness is on the stand for the reason\nJustice Scalia explained and because the jury can\nobserve them, et cetera.\nAnd so, the flip side of that has to be -\nit's the holding of Owens most recently is that those\nare meaningful things that the Confrontation Clause\nrequires. And so the flip side of those cases has to be\nthat if the witness takes the stand and doesn't\nremember, the ineffectiveness potentially of a\ncross-examination there doesn't matter, either.\nIf I could reserve what little time I have\nleft.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Fisher.\nGeneral King.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY K. KING\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. KING: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAs the Court said in Michigan v. Bryant, a\npolice interrogation resembles an ex parte examination\nwhen the primary purpose of the examination is to\ncreate, quote, an out-of-court substitute for trial\ntestimony, end quote.\nA public record not prepared by a police\nofficer is not the product of structured interrogation.\nIt is neither ex parte nor is it an examination.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that.\nYou mean so long as all -- all hearsay by non-police\nofficers can be admitted without, without confrontation,\njust because they're not police officers?\nMR. KING: No, Your Honor, I don't believe\nthat that's the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't think that was\nyour point, because it's certainly not true, is it?\nMR. KING: It is not my point, Your Honor.\nYour Honor, the point that I am making is\nthat in this case, the document, the report that we're\ntalking about is a public record, and that\ndifferentiates it from the affidavit in Melendez-Diaz,\nand so the case that -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, could you\ntell me what that means? Why is it different than the\naffidavit? It's certified, and my understanding of the\ndictionary meaning of certification is that that's an\nattestation as to the truth of the statements contained\ntherein. That's the common definition.\nSo I'm assuming it's the equivalent of an\naffidavit. So how is it different than the\nMelendez-Diaz lab report?\nMR. KING: Your Honor, and I understand, and\nI'll answer your question with regard to your\nexpectation that the certification is the same as the\naffidavit. It's not our position that they're exactly\nthe same, but there are several -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tell me why not.\nMR. KING: There are other distinguishing -\ndistinguishing features that are significant between the\naffidavit in Melendez-Diaz and the report in this case.\nFor one, the affidavit in Melendez-Diaz was prepared\npursuant to an statute in Massachusetts that called for\nthe preparation of an affidavit from the lab at some\npoint in time after the actual test was done, and it was\nto be used specifically as an in-court statement to\nreplace the live in-court testimony of the affiant.\nIn our case, the report being a public\nrecord was a record that is kept contemporaneously by\nthe analyst in the lab, it is, in this case, the .21 is\na single data point that is taken from the raw data in\nthe machine and recorded on a standard document that's\nprovided by the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can any -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that was prepared just\nfor fun, not for use in trial?\nMR. KING: No, Your Honor. I believe\nthat -- that that statement is planned to be used in\ntrial, and -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So what difference does it\nmake whether the statute requires it to be taken to be\nused at trial or whether the police send it over to be\nused at trial as a use of the State? What difference\ndoes that make?\nMR. KING: Your Honor, I think the key is to\nlook at the purpose of the analyst who was preparing the\nreport, who is a public employee, who is just carrying\nout, as our court said, copying the information from the\nmachine onto the report. And so, that's significantly\ndifferent than the amount of analysis that was done\nby -- by the -- the witness in -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. He's not\nsimply looking at a number and putting it on a report.\nHe's certifying to certain things. He's certifying to\nfollowing certain steps, that the evidence wasn't\ntampered with. He's certifying that he's complied with\nall the requirements of New Mexico law with respect to\nthe report, so he's just not copying a number.\nMR. KING: That's correct, Your Honor.\nIn -- in this case the certification doesn't necessarily\nmake the report testimonial. There -- there are several\nother examples of -- of cases where -- where evidence is\nintroduced at court that -- that have certifications.\nFor instance, it may be necessary for a\npublic records custodian to provide a copy of a birth\ncertificate in -- in a trial, and in that case, the\ncustodian always has a certification that says I\ncertify -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't the difference\nbetween those two documents is that one was prepared\nprimarily for the purposes -- this lab report, for\nprosecution purposes, and the birth certificate is not\nprepared for that? It's prepared to mark the birth of a\nperson, then it's used for many other purposes besides\ntrial; is that correct?\nMR. KING: That is correct with regard to\nthe birth -- birth certificate, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So tell me what makes\nthis certificate not primarily for the purpose of use in\nthe prosecution of an individual? Would they have\ntested this blood if -- if it wasn't to prosecute him?\nMR. KING: Your Honor, in -- in this case,\nno. This -- this case is all about a sample that was\nsent to the lab to be tested for this. But I think you\nmade it clear in Michigan v. Bryant that -- that there\nmight be a variety of purposes that should be analyzed\nin order to decide whether or not the statement is\ntestimonial or not.\nIn this case, the purpose of the -- of the\nlab analyst is significantly different from the purpose\nof the police officer who requested the analysis. The\nlab analyst does this for a living, and it's -- it's\ntheir public duty. The lab in this case is -- is\noperated by the State Department of Health, scientific\nlab division, and -- and they do a variety of different\nkinds of analysis.\nAnd so, the -- the analyst who does the test\nwouldn't necessarily have the same purpose in -- in\ncreating their statement for that document. As a matter\nof fact, the analyst would most likely be driven by the\ndesire as a scientist -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does he do any testing\nexcept for the police?\nMR. KING: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Who else do they test\nfor?\nMR. KING: This lab also tests for, in this\nparticular case, the gas chromatograph analyses of blood\nalcohol, they test for the office of the medical\nexaminer and -- and under New Mexico law, interestingly\nenough, the -- the defendant can also ask for a test.\nThey would use the same form to ask for this test.\nSo, the analysis might be being done for a\ndefendant as well as for the State.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are these lab analysts civil\nservice employees? Are the lab analysts civil service\nemployees?\nMR. KING: Yes, Your Honor, they are. They\nwork for the New Mexico Department of Health.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is there any way in which\nyour office or prosecutors or the police could cause\nthem not to get promotions if they weren't producing the\nkind of lab reports that the police and the prosecution\nmight like?\nMR. KING: No, Your Honor, they could not.\nAs a matter of fact, there -- there is a separation\nbetween the operation of the Department of Health lab\nand the police that even extends to the point of a\nphysical separation. Police officers are not allowed\ninto the lab area where -- where they are -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This analyst was fired, as\nI recall. Was he fired, placed on administrative leave\nor something?\nMR. KING: No, Your Honor, the record\nindicates that -- that Mr. Caylor was not available for\ncourt because he was on leave without pay, which -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: On leave without pay?\nMR. KING: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And do we know why it was\nleave without pay?\nMR. KING: We don't know why, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does the defense know why\nit was leave without pay? Could the defense have found\nout in cross-examination that the reason he was leave\nwithout pay because he was -- had shown himself to be\nincompetent, and they were in the process of firing him?\nI don't know whether that's true, but wouldn't that be\nimportant to the defense?\nMR. KING: Your Honor, I -- I think that the\ndefense would like to know the answer to that question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And didn't -- and didn't\nthe prosecution intentionally set it up this way so that\nthis person would not have to testify, so that he could\nnot be cross-examined? Isn't that why they sent the\nsubstitute to testify?\nMR. KING: No, Your Honor. In this case,\nthat's -- that's not the case. I -- the -- this case\ncame about in a little bit of an unusual circumstance,\nbecause both sides had been negotiating a plea agreement\nand when the -- when the plea agreement was not\nsuccessful, the defendant asked for the trial to be\nexpedited and moved quickly to trial. So the defendant\ndidn't do as much discovery, I think, as you would\nnormally do in a case like that, but -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what the facts\nare, but boy, it smells bad to me. It really does. And\neven if that was not the case, the mere possibility that\nit could have been the case shows why you should have to\nbring this person in if you want to introduce his\ntestimony.\nMR. KING: Your Honor, I think that the key\nhere is that if you would not look at the -- at any of\nthe qualities of the declarant in deciding whether the\nstatement is testimonial or not. And so once -- once\nthe Court makes the determination as to whether it is\ntestimonial or not, you wouldn't -- even if you would\nlike to ask those questions, you wouldn't have the\nopportunity to ask those questions.\nIn this case, factually, it might also be\nthat Mr. Caylor was on unpaid leave because he had run\nout of his regular leave time, and he decided to do\nthat. We -- it would all be speculation -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I agree that whether it's\ntestimonial does not depend upon whether there's\nskullduggery or not, but the possibility of\nskullduggery, even in machine -- machine situations such\nas this, is a good reason for saying this is\ntestimonial.\nMR. KING: Your Honor, I think that's why\nit's -- it's important that this is a public records\ncase, because that is one of the assumptions that courts\nhave made for hundreds of years with regard to the fact\nthat there is -- there is a duty by the person who's\ntaking down the information to -- to observe in a\nregular manner, to record in a regular manner, and so\nthat's important here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the principal\nthrust of your brief, that this isn't testimonial at\nall. You have not said because it was unsworn, because\nyou recognize the certification is the same, but you're\ntrying to equate it to a business record, public record?\nMR. KING: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You do have the hurdle\nthat this record was created for a specific purpose. It\nwas created to provide evidence for use in a criminal\nprosecution.\nMR. KING: Your Honor, I don't believe that\nthat is the only purpose that this form 705 could be\nused for. It is the common purpose for this form, but\nit is a form that the lab uses in every circumstance.\nAnd indeed, as I said, in New Mexico law, the defendant\ncan ask for a second test. They can have that done.\nIt's done at the State's expense. They can have it done\nat any laboratory that they want to.\nBut if they have the report done at the\nState lab, and they're entitled to have that done, they\nwould utilize the same form.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, does the -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, what are the other -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does the analyst\nknow whether he's being asked to do one for the\nprosecution or the defendant?\nMR. KING: Not necessarily, Your Honor. I\n-- I actually don't know the answer to that specifically\nexcept that the form -- and if you look at it, it's in\nthe Joint Appendix -- does have some information in part\nA that -- that indicates that there is a police officer\nthat -- that sent the test to the lab. There's a nurse\nthat did that in this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, so they would\nknow the difference, right?\nMR. KING: They -- I think that the same\ninformation would be on the form whether the defendant\nsubmitted it or whether the -- or whether the\nprosecution submitted it, and -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, not the same\ninformation. One would say the police submitted it and\nthe other one would say the defendant submitted it,\nright?\nMR. KING: Your Honor -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So if the police submitted\nit, the -- the person doing the -- the test would know\nthat the police submitted it, I assume.\nMR. KING: If you look at the form, Your\nHonor, it would have the same information, but we're\nnot -- we're not here today arguing that the analyst\nwouldn't know that the police submitted this form. But\nit is an arm's length request, and once again, the Court\naddressed that in your most recent case, in Michigan v.\nBryant, I believe because the -- the question is whether\nor not there was an interrogation. One of the key\nquestions is whether there was an interrogation.\nThis clearly does not look like a case where\nthere was an interrogation by the police. It was a\nrequest on a standard form that was -- that was sent.\nAnd so the purpose test, it appears from Michigan v.\nBryant, would not even apply in cases where there's not\na police interrogation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is a key question\nwhether this was an interrogation? Does the\nConfrontation Clause apply only to confrontations? To\ninterrogations? I mean, if a -- if a witness, before\nthe police ask any questions, blurts out, you know,\n\"Jones did it,\" can that statement get in because it has\nnot been in response to an interrogation?\nMR. KING: Your Honor, the analysis would be\nsomewhat different. That's the point, is that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It would be different\nbecause interrogation doesn't make any difference. That\nis not the condition for the application of the -- of\nthe Confrontation Clause.\nMR. KING: Your Honor, we -- it appears that\nit does make some difference with regard to Michigan v.\nBryant, and it's new to all of us.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If it were an\ninterrogation, the factors mentioned in Michigan v.\nBryant would be relevant, presumably, but since this\nwasn't an interrogation, I don't see how that has any -\nany relevance whatever.\nMR. KING: Well, the relevance, Your Honor,\nI think, is since it's not an interrogation, then -\nthen you have to look at, and I think the Court has set\nthis out, you have to look at the nature of the evidence\nand to make a determination as to whether the evidence\nthat's being presented is merely a substitute for live,\nin-court testimony.\nAnd there, back to the difference between\nthe affidavit in Melendez-Diaz and the report in this\ncase is, in our report, even if Mr. Caylor had been at\nthe trial and on the stand, it would have been necessary\nto have the report as well. I think Justice Ginsburg\nraised this point, is that six months after the\nexamination was done, to cross-examine the analyst and\nask him, do you remember what the result was six months\nago from this one test out of a hundred that he ran, he\nwill not remember without looking at the report. The\nreport is the best evidence in this case to prove the\npoint that is being made here, and -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he'd look at the\nreport and say, gee, I don't remember; you know, I do a\nlot of these reports. But then the prosecution in\ndirect would say, well, how do you do them? And he\nwould say, I always do this, I always do that, I always\ndo the other thing. Did you do it in this case? Well,\nI don't specifically remember this case, but I always do\nit. And that's the testimony that would go to the jury.\nIt would be pretty persuasive. Not as good as if he did\nremember.\nMR. KING: That's correct, Your Honor, and\nso that's why the analysis of whether this is\ntestimonial or not is such an important analysis,\nbecause if the -- the reasoning that the Court has had\nfor all of the hearsay exceptions, for excited\nutterances or, in this case, for a public record, would\nlook at whether or not that evidence was the best\nevidence to support the truth-finding purpose of the\ntrial. That's our -- that's our analysis, at least,\nYour Honor.\nAnd what we are arguing in this case is that\nthere is no difference between Mr. Caylor transferring\nthe .21 data from the machine to the piece of paper than\nthere would be if you took a photograph, for instance,\nof the machine data and -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why did you give the\ndata to the analyst at trial? If there wasn't a more\npersuasive power in the lab certification, why didn't\nyou just have the new expert look at the printout from\nthe graph and say, this is what it says?\nMR. KING: Procedurally, in this case, Your\nHonor, this -- the trial at the District Court level\noccurred before the Court's opinion in Melendez-Diaz.\nAnd so I think that at this point in time, that it would\nbe more normal behavior for the -- for the State to\npresent the raw data as well.\nIn this case, Mr. Razatos -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's that as well.\nDon't you introduce the lab report because it -- it\ngives more credence to the reliability of the result?\nBecause he's certifying that he followed certain\nprocedures, that he did certain things, that the sample\nwasn't tampered with?\nMR. KING: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is it -- you're looking\nfor that testimony, correct? You're looking, at trial,\nto that testimony to bolster the test?\nMR. KING: Not using testimony in the sense\nthat we're talking about testimony here. I mean, you\nmight want that -- very well want that evidence in, not\ndifferent from other cases where if you had a -- it was\nnecessary to submit the judgment of a felony, for\ninstance, to show that a person in a later trial was a\nfelon with -- a felon in possession of a firearm, you\nwould have a certification from the court clerk that\nwould say, I certify that the copy of this document that\nI'm submitting to the court is a true copy of -- that's\nalso not testimonial from -- for the purposes of the\nConfrontation Clause I don't believe.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You might want that in\norder to show the machine says X, Y, Z, but that's only\nas good as the stuff that was put into it. So you're\ngoing to have to show that this was his blood put into\nit. And many, many people might have handled it, and\nthere might be a routine so that they all check a box\nwhen it's sealed and they get it.\nIs it your understanding if you lose these\ncases -- this case that you then have to take into court\nall those people?\nMR. KING: That's certainly a concern, Your\nHonor. I -- if you look at this document, there are six\nor seven people who have certifications on the -- on the\ndire -- different statements on the document. There are\nthree certifications; there's one from the -- from the\nwoman who takes the samples into the lab that says she\nreceived the samples; there's this one from Mr. Caylor;\nthere's one from -- from the reviewing analyst who\nreviews it; and I gather that the -- that the Petitioner\nis only challenging the -- that one certification\nfrom -- from -- from Mr. Caylor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The chain of custody wasn't\n-- wasn't contested here, was it?\nMR. KING: It was not. And this document -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it often contested? My\nimpression is it's not very often contested.\nMR. KING: I'm not aware of it being\ncontested often, Your Honor, I -- and this form I think\nis one of the things in New Mexico that really helps\nwith that. The reason that the court submitted the form\nis that you have everything relating to the chain of\nevidence on -- on one document, and -- and so indeed a\nlot of those statements really help -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but the reason I asked\nthe question is because I don't think it is normally\ncontested. It's normally a business record of some\nkind.\nHowever, what I was looking for is a\ndistinction, because in the future I don't see why it\nwouldn't be contested, unless there's a distinction.\nMR. KING: Yes, Your Honor, and I think that\nthe distinction is that in this case the -- the analyst\nis not essentially a party to the action. The analyst\nworks arm's-length transaction from -- from the -- from\nthe police and from the prosecutors, and so he's not\npart of the prosecution team, is -- is how I've been\nthinking about it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: General, I know your State\ntakes a different view of it or you wouldn't be here,\nbut aren't there are a number of States that -- that do\nprovide the testimony of the technician, who do require\nthe technician to come in and -- and testify?\nMR. KING: Your Honor, I believe that there\nare other States that have statutes that -- that have\ndifferent ways of presenting evidence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And have they had, to your\nknowledge, serious problems about defendants contesting\nchain of custody simply because this other thing is\nrequired? Again, I'm -- I'm not aware that that's been\na problem. I think it's a boogeyman.\nMR. KING: Your Honor, we -- we understand\nthat -- that the -- that the burden on the State is -\nis not an issue that comes directly into the analysis\nrelating to the Confrontation Clause. I -- in New\nMexico, for instance, one of the problems that we have\nis that -- is that the lab's centrally located in\nAlbuquerque and the -- and in this case the trial was in\nSan Juan County, so -- so the witness has to drive for\nabout 3 hours to get to where the courthouse is. So\nthat's sort of different in New Mexico than, say, in\nMassachusetts or something like that. And -- and even\nfor 10 minutes worth of testimony, they might have to\ndrive 6 hours and take a whole day out of the lab.\nSo it -- it is a problem that -- that is\nthere, but I don't think that it is the seminal issue\nthat -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are there States -- are\nthere States that do require a -- a -- a prosecutor to\nproduce everyone who has handled something in a chain of\ncustody at a -- at a laboratory, a criminal -- you know,\nnormal business? Are there States that do require that?\nIf so, could you tell me a couple, because I -\nMR. KING: Your Honor, I'm not aware of any\nState that requires that everyone in the chain of\ncustody appear in -- in trial. It is indeed normally up\nto the prosecutor with regard to chain of custody to\ndetermine who --who is going to be appearing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about medical reports\nthat are aimed at a particular known victim of a crime\nand thus will end up in trial? For example, a graph, a\ngraph which the nurse keeps, which is a statement by the\nnurse that the patient's temperature on such and such a\nday was 98.6 or whatever, and normally that graph would\nbe introduced; but are there any States that wouldn't\nrequire -- would say, oh, no, you have to produce the\nnurse? You have to produce the doctor for all medical\nrecords? Which of course, are known by the keeper that\nthey will be used at the criminal trial.\nAre there any States that require that?\nMR. KING: There are none that I'm aware of,\nYour Honor. I -- I don't -- I haven't -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are there any States that\nrequire ordinary business records perhaps of the most\nordinary kind, which always are statements that somebody\ndid something on a particular day? When those business\nrecords happen to be kept before with the knowledge that\nthey'll probably be introduced at the trial, are there\nStates that require the man or woman who made the\nbusiness record to come into court?\nMR. KING: No, Your Honor, and I think\nthat's the point of all of those. State law has their\n-- their hearsay law that -- that analyzed whether those\nstatements are admissible.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I don't think\nthat's an accurate response, at least if you include the\nqualification that Justice Breyer put in the question,\nwhich is that the records were kept with the knowledge\nthat they would be introduced in -- in criminal trials.\nI mean, you can say that all the records of\nlabs -- let's assume there's a -- there's a police lab\nwhich -- which only does police testing of blood. Those\nwould be business records of the lab, but they certainly\nwould not be introducible just because they're business\nrecords. If the record is made for the use in\nprosecution, surely it's -- it doesn't come under the\nbusiness records exception, or else we wouldn't be here\ntoday.\nMR. KING: Your Honor, I think the\nhypothetical that -- that you say really shows where the\nline is. If -- if the lab is a police lab and only\ndoing the analysis for the police, then they -- they\nlook a lot more like a party to the -- to the lawsuit,\nand certainly the hearsay exceptions have made it clear\nthat even though observations are -- are generally -\nthat are public records are generally allowed, that\nobservations by police officers are not.\nAnd -- and so -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's an independent lab and\npolice always send it to this independent lab, but in\nfact it's an independent business, it makes a profit;\nbut all the stuff it does it knows is going to be used\nat trial. That wouldn't be admissible, would it? Even\nthough it's a perfectly normal business record.\nMR. KING: Your Honor, I think that that\ndepends on -- on how you look at the purpose and whose\npurpose it is that -- that you're analyzing. Now first\noff that, would assume that the purpose test applies in\nthis case, and it seems to me since Michigan v. Bryant\nthat the purpose test may not apply to these kinds of\ncases where -- where there's not a police interrogation.\nBut if -- if that is the case and the\npurpose test applies, then it -- it also appears to me\nthat the -- that the test now requires that -- that you\nlook not just at the purpose of the policeman who -\nwho's asking the question, but that you look at the\npurpose of the declarant, and in this case the purpose\nof the labs clearly is -- is a purpose just to -- to get\nthe sample, do a good analysis, and -- and report that\nanalysis to, in New Mexico's case, both parties.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -\nMR. KING: The analysis that comes from our\nState lab goes not only to the prosecution but also to\nthe defendant.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General, we seem to be\ndescribing -- this case seemed rather particular, that\nis, there was no objection by New Mexico to having an\nanalyst show up, Razatos; so -- so he had to travel\nhowever long he said. It's just a question of one\nemployee's time rather than the other.\nBut -- and then you described how simple\nthis thing was, you just put it in a machine, you would\nget out a piece of paper. Why didn't New Mexico have\nthis -- there was an additional sample that could have\nbeen -- it would have been si simple to just retest it.\nHaving the witness come to the court, why don't you arm\nhim with the additional test, and then there would be no\ncontroversy?\nMR. KING: Your Honor, one of the problems\nin New Mexico would be since -- since the court believed\nthat -- that that report was -- was admissible, if they\ndid a second sample and --- and tried to submit that it\nwould be cumulative evidence, and probably would be kept\nout by -- by the rule in New Mexico in that case.\nSo Mr. Razatos did have an important purpose\nat this trial. In New Mexico you still I believe have\nto have a witness who -- who can authenticate the\ndocument to bring the document in. It might not have\nhad to have been Mr. Razatos in this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let's say that this\nCourt holds that the Confrontation Clause requires the\npresence of the actual analyst to testify about the\nsample. Is there anything in the law that says that\nthat testimony is suddenly excused, and you do not need\nthe analyst if there's another sample available for the\ndefendant to test? That's not the rule, is it?\nMR. KING: It's not the rule, Your Honor,\nalthough one of the things that we pointed out is that\n-- is that the State always keeps two samples, that the\ndefendant has the right statutorily in New Mexico to -\nto have a sample retested at a lab -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm saying that\nanalytically that does not bear on the question whether\nor not the sample that's introduced by the State\nrequires the -- the analyst to be present. They're just\nunrelated.\nMR. KING: Correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That may -- that may show\nthat the confrontation rule is a silly rule. But it\ndoesn't -- but it -- there's -- assuming confrontation\nis required, it's not excused -\nMR. KING: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- by the presence of\nanother sample.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I don't follow that\nbecause we have a substitute now. Caylor is out of the\npicture; we know that it is the defendant's blood\nbecause everything else is the same, and there's this\nvial that has a certain amount of blood and there's a\ncertain amount left over, so it's not cumulative,\nbecause Caylor's out of the picture. It is the\ndefendant's blood that has been lab tested by another\nanalyst.\nMR. KING: I'm sorry, Your Honor, in -- in\nyour hypothetical, if -- if the State knew far enough\nahead of time that they -- they would not be able to\nsubmit the -- the -- that analyst's results, they could\nalways -- because the blood sample continues to exist,\nthey could always retest that and -- and have another\nwitness who could do that. Depending on how the Court\nrules in this case, it might be that States will be\nrequired to do that.\nBut at this point in time under -- under the\ncurrent jurisprudence, it -- it didn't appear to the\nState that they needed to retest the sample, and I think\nyou have to worry a little bit about -- about how many\npeople you might indeed have to have come into court and\ntestify if -- if the State -- if the burden on the State\nis that you have to -- you have to sample twice just in\ncase you're going to lose one of your analysts, I -- I\nthink that that does indeed put a great burden on the\nState to do that. And so -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: General, I -- I don't want\nto eat up your -- your little remaining time, I think\nyou can answer yes or no. Does New Mexico assert the\nsame rule as applicable to ballistics testing?\nMR. KING: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why?\nMR. KING: I think that you have to do the\nanalysis in each kind of statement that you're looking\nat, Your Honor, to determine whether or not the\nstatement that's -- that's being made and that's being\nproposed for trial is a substitute for live in-court\ntestimony. And so, with regard to ballistics, you know,\nyou would be looking at a little bit different set of\nfacts.\nBut in this case the facts are that -- that\nthe gas chromatograph gave us a printout that said that\nthe -- that the level of alcohol in the blood is .21\ngrams per 100 milliliters, Mr. Caylor transferred that\nto a form, and that's what we are putting in.\nI -- I think that -- that it proves the\npoint that I'm talking about, in a ballistics analysis,\nyou would have to have some analysis and someone to\nreach a conclusion. And it's that that sets\nMelendez-Diaz apart from this case, is -- is that there\nwas -- that there was some analysis by -- by -- by\nthe -- the declarant in that case. And in the\nballistics cases I think, most often, you would find\nthat.\nNow, if the -- if in the ballistics case you\njust took a photograph of the bullet and wanted to bring\nthat into the court and say here's what the bullet looks\nlike, the jury then could make a determination whether\nthey think that that bullet appears to be the same as\nthe other. That wouldn't be covered by the\nConfrontation Clause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Certainly not.\nMR. KING: And -- and -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you -- you -- you think\nthe result would be a -- the same if we could develop a\nmachine that you put the bullet in and -- and -- and -\nthat's been fired from this gun, and the murder bullet,\nand the machine goes, blah, blah, blah, and it spits\nout, you know, 99 percent, 99.9 percent match, that\nwould be okay?\nMR. KING: May I answer the question, Your\nHonor?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMR. KING: In -- in that case, if -- if the\nmachine were able to do all of that, the machine\nessentially is giving you the best evidence, yes, I\nbelieve that that would be the case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Fisher, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FISHER: Thank you. Let me try to make\nfour quick points.\nFirst, Justice Alito, I said the first\nobjection was at JA 40, it's actually 44-45 in the Joint\nAppendix.\nWith regard to the State's argument about\nwhether this document is testimonial, I would simply\nurge the Court to take a very close look at the lab\nreport itself. It's at JA 62. At the top it says,\nMr. Chief Justice, in response to your question,\narresting officer identification, and the officer\nwrites, check for blood alcohol concentration. That's\nthe order to the lab.\nIf you look at the bottom in the\ncertification of analyst, he certifies that the\nfollowing is true and correct, signs his name, and\nperhaps the most critical thing is at the very bottom,\nthe actual rules of the New Mexico evidence law and\ncriminal procedure law are referenced. So, it's exactly\nlike Melendez-Diaz. This is a document that is\nexpressly prepared for substitute live testimony.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not under oath, though,\nthat's the only difference?\nMR. FISHER: Not under oath if a\ncertification is actually different than an oath, that\njust makes this worse, as in Crawford this Court said\nthat it would be implausible that trial by affidavit\nwould be prohibited but trial by unsworn affidavit would\nbe okay.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do the rules of\ncriminal -- do the rules of criminal procedure in New\nMexico say it should be prima facie evidence?\nMR. FISHER: They say much the same thing.\nThere are -- there are several rules referenced at the\nbottom that all make this automatically admissible,\nnotwithstanding the hearsay rule to prove the truth of\nthe matter asserted.\nWith respect to Justice Ginsburg's question\nabout retesting, you are exactly right. The State had\nmany choices in the case -- in this case about how to\nproceed. But if it wanted Mr. Razatos to be its\nwitness, all it had to do was have him do a -- retest it\nand write a new report and have him be the witness.\nThere is no reason it would have to introduce\nMr. Caylor's report then and come up against any State\nlaw issue. Mr. Razatos could have been the live\nwitness.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it depends on\nwhen they do it, of course. I mean, you have the right\nto look at their evidence presumably so -- so far in\nadvance of trial, whatever, and if they had to get a\nnew -- new technician, that would have to put off the\ntrial -\nMR. FISHER: And I think that -- I'm sorry.\nI think that goes to my last point, which is, Justice\nBreyer, you're talking about States that do this -- I'll\ncombine my answer to these two things. A continuance\nwould have been perfectly -- perfectly appropriate if\nthat scenario had arisen, Mr. Chief Justice, and that's\nwhat -- one thing the public -- Public Defender Service\nbrief it talks about 23 -- 26 jurisdictions encompassing\n23 different States that follow the rule that we're\nadvocating today. And it -- we're not asking for more\nwitnesses. It's important that we're -- this isn't a\nmultiple witness problem, we're just asking for a\ndifferent witness.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. FISHER: In other words, the State just\nbrought the wrong witness. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
