        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 08-1448,\nSchwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Association.\nMr. Morazzini.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ZACKERY P. MORAZZINI\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. MORAZZINI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe California law at issue today before\nthis Court differs from the New York law at issue in\nGinsberg in only one respect: Where New York was\nconcerned with minors' access to harmful sexual material\noutside the guidance of a parent, California is no less\nconcerned with a minor's access to the deviant level of\nviolence that is presented in a certain category of\nvideo games that can be no less harmful to the\ndevelopment of minors.\nWhen this Court in Ginsberg crafted a rule\nof law that permits States to regulate a minor's access\nto such material outside the presence of a parent, it\ndid so for two fundamental reasons that are equally\napplicable this morning in this case.\nFirst, this rule permits parents' claim to\nauthority in their own household to direct the\nupbringing and the development of their children; and,\nsecondly, this rule promotes the States' independent\ninterest in helping parents protect the well-being of\nchildren in those instances when parents cannot be\npresent.\nSo this morning, California asks this Court\nto adopt a rule of law that permits States to restrict\nminors' ability to purchase deviant, violent video games\nthat the legislature has determined can be harmful to\nthe development and the upbringing -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's a deviant -- a\ndeviant, violent video game? As opposed to what? A\nnormal violent video game?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Yes, Your Honor. Deviant\nwould be departing from established norms.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There are established norms\nof violence?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Well, I think if we look\nback -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, some of the Grimms'\nfairy tales are quite grim, to tell you the truth.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MORAZZINI: Agreed, Your Honor. But the\nlevel of violence -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are they okay? Are you\ngoing to ban them, too?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Not at all, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What's the difference? I\nmean, if you -- if you are supposing a category of\nviolent materials dangerous to children, then how do you\ncut it off at video games? What about films? What\nabout comic books? Grimms' fairy tales?\nWhy are video games special? Or does your\nprinciple extend to all deviant, violent materials in\nwhatever form?\nMR. MORAZZINI: No, Your Honor. That's why\nI believe California incorporated the three prongs of\nthe Miller standard. So it's not just deviant violence.\nIt's not just patently offensive violence. It's\nviolence that meets all three of the terms set forth\nin -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think that misses\nJustice Ginsburg's question, which was: Why just video\ngames? Why not movies, for example, as well?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Sure, Your Honor. The\nCalifornia Legislature was presented with substantial\nevidence that demonstrates that the interactive nature\nof violent -- of violent video games where the minor or\nthe young adult is the aggressor, is the -- is the\nindividual acting out this -- this obscene level of\nviolence, if you will, is especially harmful to minors.\nIt -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, do you actually have\nstudies that show that video games are more harmful to\nminors than movies are?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Well, in the record, Your\nHonor, I believe it's the Gentile and Gentile study\nregarding violent video games as exemplary teachers.\nThe authors there note that video games are not only\nexemplary teachers of pro-social activities, but also\nexemplary teachers of aggression, which was the\nfundamental concern of the California Legislature in\nenacting this statute.\nSo, while the science is continually\ndeveloping -- indeed, it appears that studies are being\nreleased every month regarding -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was the -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And suppose -- suppose a new\nstudy suggested that movies were just as violent. Then,\npresumably, California could regulate movies just as it\ncould regulate video games.\nMR. MORAZZINI: Well, Your Honor, there is\nscientific literature out there regarding the impact of\nviolent media on -- on children. In fact, for decades,\nthe President, Congress, the FTC, parenting groups have\nbeen uniquely concerned with the level of violent media\navailable to minors that they have ready access to.\nSo -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know -- is that\nanswering Justice Kagan's question? One of the studies,\nthe Anderson study, says that the effect of violence is\nthe same for a Bugs Bunny episode as it is for a violent\nvideo. So can the legislature now, because it has that\nstudy, say we can outlaw Bugs Bunny?\nMR. MORAZZINI: No -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And there are people who\nwould say that the cartoon has very little social value;\nit's entertainment but not much else. This is\nentertainment.\nI'm not suggesting that I like this video,\nthe one at issue that you provided the five-minute clip\nabout. To me, it's not entertainment, but that's not\nthe point. To some, it may well be.\nMR. MORAZZINI: Justice Sotomayor, cartoons\ndo not depart from the established norms to -- of a\nlevel of violence to which children have been\nhistorically exposed to. We believe the level of\nviolence in these video games -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That same argument could\nhave been made when movies first came out. They could\nhave said, oh, we've had violence in Grimms' fairy\ntales, but we've never had it, you know, live on the\nscreen. I mean, every time there's a new technology,\nyou can make that argument.\nMR. MORAZZINI: Well, Your Honor, I think\nthat's the beauty of incorporating the three prongs of\nthe Miller standard into California's law. This\nstandard is very prophylactic and ensures that only a\nnarrow category of material will be covered, certainly\nnot Grimms' fairy tales.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How is this any\ndifferent than what we said we don't do in the First\nAmendment field in Stevens, where we said we don't look\nat a category of speech and decide that some of it has\nlow value. We decide whether a category of speech has a\nhistorical tradition of being regulated. Now, other\nthan some State statutes that you point to, some of\nwhich are very clearly the same as those that we struck\ndown in Wynn, where's the tradition of regulating\nviolence?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Your Honor, California\nsubmits that when the rights of minors are at issue and\nnot the rights of adults, the standard should be more\nflexible. The Constitution should recognize that when\nthe audience is minors, the same standard should not\napply. Therefore, the question should not be whether or\nnot historically violent speech was regulated, but\nwhether or not the Constitution guarantees minors a\nright -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you get rid of rap\nmusic? Have you heard some of the lyrics of some of the\nrap music, some of the original violent songs that have\nbeen sung about killing people and about other violence\ndirected to them?\nMR. MORAZZINI: I would agree that it -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could the State -\nMR. MORAZZINI: I would agree it's\negregious, Justice Sotomayor. However -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why isn't that obscene\nin the sense that you're using the word, or deviant?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Well, I'm not sure initially\nthat it's directly harmful to the development of minors\nin the way that we know that violent video games can be.\nWe know that violent material, like sexual material,\nappeals to a base instinct in -- in especially minors.\nIt has -- it can be presented in a manner that -\nJUSTICE ALITO: When you talk about minors,\nwhat -- what are you -- what age group are you talking\nabout? If a video game manufacturer has to decide under\nyour statute how to -- where its game stands, what age\nof -- of a child should the manufacturer have in mind?\nA 17-year-old? A 10-year-old?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Your Honor, I would submit\nthat, just like in the obscenity context for minors, a\nlaw similar to the New York law at issue in Ginsberg,\nthough California's law hasn't been construed or\napplied, I would submit that the jury would be\ninstructed to consider minors as a whole. In California\nthat's under 18 years old. So I believe they would just\nbe instructed minors as a class, not -\nJUSTICE ALITO: How can they -- how can they\ndo that? Isn't the average person likely to think that\nwhat's appropriate for a 17-year-old may not be\nappropriate for a 10-year-old or an 8-year-old?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Your Honor, I think juries\nand judges do this every day in the\nvariable obscenity -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But California doesn't do\nthat. California has in big letters \"18.\" So it's not\n-- is it okay for a 7-year-old? Is it okay for a\n12-year-old? Part of this statute requires labeling\nthese video games in big numbers \"18.\" So it's 18, and\nCalifornia doesn't make any distinctions between\n17-year-olds and 4-year-olds.\nMR. MORAZZINI: Justice Ginsburg, and I\nthink rightfully so. I think a jury would be charged\nwith -- with perhaps the standard of what the community\nbelieves an average minor. So the manufacturer would\nconsider -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because the average minor\nis halfway between 0 and 18, is that 9 years old?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MORAZZINI: Fair point, Justice Scalia.\nI think a jury could be instructed as to the typical age\ngroup of minors that are -- that are playing these\ngames.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why wouldn't you, if\nnecessary, simply say that -- that a -- a video game\nthat appeals to the prurient, shameful, or morbid\ninterests of those 18 or under, but let's take 18, and\nit's not suitable in the community for those 18, and it\nhas no redeeming importance of any kind, no serious\nliterary, artistic, political, or scientific value for\nthose 18, that at least as to those, you can't sell it\nwithout -- the parent can buy it, but the child can't\nbuy it. So you can't sell to a 12-year-old something\nthat would be horrible for an 18-year-old. Is that -\nwould you be willing to accept that, if necessary, to\nmake this okay on its face?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Justice Breyer, absolutely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Morazzini, could I take\nyou back to Justice Scalia's original question, which\nwas what counts as deviant violence or morbid violence?\nBecause I read your briefs all the way through, and the\nonly thing that I found was -- you said was clearly\ncovered by this statute was Postal 2. But presumably\nthe statute applies to more than one video game. So\nwhat else does it apply to? How many video games? What\nkind of video games?\nI mean, how would you describe in plain\nEnglish what -- what morbid violence is, what you have\nto see in a video game for it to be covered?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Okay, Justice Kagan, I would\ngo back to the language of the statute, and the statute\ncovers video games where the range of options available\nto the player includes maiming, killing, dismembering,\ntorturing, sexually assaulting, and those types of\nviolence. So I would look to games where -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So anything that has those\nkinds of violence counts?\nMR. MORAZZINI: No, and then we would move\nto the three prongs of the Miller standard, Your Honor.\nWe would look to see what -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, so how do we separate\nviolent games that are covered from violent games just\nas violent that are not covered?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Well, Your Honor, I think a\njury could be instructed with expert testimony, with\nvideo clips of game play, and to judge for\nthemselves whether -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not concerned about the\njury judging. I'm concerned about the producer of the\ngames who has to know what he has to do in order to\ncomply with the law. And you're telling me, well, a\njury can -- of course, a jury can make up its mind, I'm\nsure. But a law that has criminal penalties has to be\nclear. And how is the manufacturer to know whether a\nparticular violent game is covered or not?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Well, Your Honor, if we\nlook -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would he convene his own\njury and -- and try it before -- you know -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I really wouldn't know\nwhat to do as a manufacturer.\nMR. MORAZZINI: Justice Scalia, I'm\nconvinced that the video game industry will know what to\ndo. They rate their video games every day on the basis\nof violence. They rate them for the intensity of the\nviolence, the amount -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So is what's covered here\nthe -- the mature category in the ratings? Is that what\nthis statute covers? Is that what it's meant to cover?\nMR. MORAZZINI: I believe that some mature\nrated games would be covered, but not all.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Some, but not all.\nMR. MORAZZINI: But not all.\nYour Honor, just like with sexual material,\nwe can -- we can trust individual panderers of sexual\nmaterial to judge whether or not it's a -- it's in -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me just make one\ncomment on that point. It seems to me all or at least\nthe great majority of the questions today are designed\nto probe whether or not this statute is vague. And you\nsay the beauty of the statute is that it utilizes the\ncategories that have been used in the obscenity area and\nthat -- that there's an obvious parallel there.\nThe problem is, is that for generations\nthere has been a societal consensus about sexual\nmaterial. Sex and violence have both been around a long\ntime, but there's a societal consensus about what's\noffensive for sexual material, and there are judicial\ndiscussions on it. Now, those judicial discussions are\nnot precise. You could have had the same questions\ntoday with reference to an obscenity statute, and we\nhave -- we have said that with reference to obscenity,\nthere are certain -- that there are certain materials\nthat are not protected. Those rules are not precise at\nthe margins, and some would say not precise in a more\nsignificant degree as well.\nBut you're asking us to go into an entirely\nnew area where there are no consensus, no judicial\nopinions. And this is -- and this indicates to me the\nstatute might be vague, and I just thought you'd like to\nknow that -- that reaction.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MORAZZINI: Justice Kennedy, as with\nsexual -- the regulation of sexual material and\nobscenity, we had to start somewhere. California is\nchoosing to start now. We can build a consensus as to\nwhat level of violence is in fact patently offensive for\nminors, is deviant for minors, just as the case law has\ndeveloped over time with sexual depictions. Your Honor,\nI believe the key is the -- the similarities violence\nhas with sex. This is material -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about excessive\nglorification of drinking, movies that have too much\ndrinking? Does that have an effect on minors? I\nsuppose so.\nI -- I am not just concerned with the\nvagueness. I am concerned with the vagueness, but I'm\nconcerned with the First Amendment, which says Congress\nshall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. And\nit was always understood that the freedom of speech did\nnot include obscenity. It has never been understood\nthat the freedom of speech did not include portrayals of\nviolence.\nYou're -- you're asking us to create a -- a\nwhole new prohibition which the American people never -\nnever ratified when they ratified the First Amendment.\nThey knew there were -- you know, obscenity was -- was\nbad, but what's next after violence? Drinking?\nSmoking? Movies that show smoking can't be shown to\nchildren? Does -- will that affect them? Of course, I\nsuppose it will.\nBut is -- is that -- are -- are we to sit\nday by day to decide what else will be made an exception\nfrom the First Amendment? Why -- why is this particular\nexception okay, but the other ones that I just suggested\nare not okay?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Well, Justice Scalia, I\nwould like to highlight the fact that the material at\nissue in Ginsberg was not obscene. Under no existing\ndefinition of obscenity was the partial nudity that this\nCourt allowed States to regulate minors' access to -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I think what\nJustice Scalia wants to know is what James Madison\nthought about video games.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE ALITO: Did he enjoy them?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I want to know what\nJames Madison thought about violence. Was there any\nindication that anybody thought, when the First\nAmendment was adopted, that there -- there was an\nexception to it for -- for speech regarding violence?\nAnybody?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Your Honor, as to minors, I\nbelieve, looking at some of the historic statutes States\nhad passed, had enacted in the past, there was a social\nrecognition that there is a level of violent material -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the earliest\nstatute?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Pardon?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the earliest\nstatute and how much enforcement was entered?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Your Honor, I don't know the\nearliest statute off the top of my head. I believe they\ngo back into the early 1900s, perhaps later. I\napologize, but I don't know that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But, on the principle, I\nmean, it's been quite some years, hasn't it, before this\n-- since this Court has held that one instance that\ncourts -- that the country, legislatures, can regulate\nare fighting words? And we regulate fighting words,\ndon't we?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because they provoke\nviolence. And the American Psychological Association\nand the American Pediatric Association have said that\ncertain kinds of video games here create violence when\nchildren are exposed. There are 80 people who think to\nthe contrary. There are two huge things of meta\nstudies that think that -- not to the contrary. All\nright. So what are we supposed to do?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Well, Justice Breyer, I\nthink, in going back to Justice Scalia's question, I\nfind it hard to believe, and I know of no historical\nevidence that suggests, that our Founding Fathers, in\nenacting the First Amendment, intended to guarantee\nvideo game retailers' First Amendment right -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I go back to -- to\nwhat Justice Breyer was asking? Because this Court,\nwith respect to the fighting words -- Chaplinsky and \"in\nyour face\" and provoke an immediate action -- the Court\nhas been very careful to cordon that off so it doesn't\nhave this spillover potential. So you -- you didn't\nlatch on to fighting words. Your analogy is to\nobscenity for teenagers, as I understand it.\nMR. MORAZZINI: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. With\nregard to fighting words, the -- the societal interest\nin preventing acts of violence is -- is different than\nthe concern at issue here today.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So could I just make -- make\nsure I understand that, Mr. Morazzini, because, as I\nunderstand, the State has given up its argument that the\ninterest protected by this law is an interest in\npreventing minors who see these games from going out and\ncommitting violent acts themselves; that the State is\nnot saying that that's the interest in the law; is that\ncorrect? That instead the State is saying that the\ninterest in the law is in protecting children's moral\ndevelopment generally?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Justice Kagan, we welcome\nthat as -- as an effect of California's regulation, but\nthe primary interest was the internal intrinsic harm to\nminors. That's what the State of California is deeply\nconcerned with in this case.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have a point of\nclarification. Justice Ginsburg talked about the\nlabeling parts of this Act. The circuit court struck\nthose portions of the Act. You have not challenged that\nruling.\nMR. MORAZZINI: Justice -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There are two sections\nto the Act.\nMR. MORAZZINI: Sure.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: One is a criminal act\nfor selling to a minor, and the other is a requirement\nthat you label in a certain way each video. The\ndistrict court said both were -- I think the circuit\ncourt said both were unconstitutional, correct?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Yes, Justice Sotomayor.\nThey found -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And your brief has not\naddressed the labeling requirements at all.\nMR. MORAZZINI: Well, we didn't, Your Honor,\nbecause one holding of the Ninth Circuit hinged upon the\nother. In striking down the body of California's law,\nthe restriction on the sale, the court found that since\nit's not illegal to sell these games to 18-year-olds,\nthat the governmental purpose served behind the label\nitself was -- was in fact misleading. So under the\nZauderer case law -- I don't have the case cite before\nme -- but under Zauderer regarding lawyers' advertising\nof -- of services, it's -- the government can require a\nlabeling, so long as it's necessary to prevent\nmisleading the consumer.\nThe Ninth Circuit found that because they\nstruck down the body of our law, that the \"18\" label\nwould be misleading. So that -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's an interesting\nconcession on your part, that the labeling doesn't have\na need separate from the restriction on sale. I would\nhave thought that if you wanted a lesser restriction,\nthat you would have promoted labeling as a reasonable\nstrict scrutiny restriction to permit the control of\nsale of these materials to minors, but you seem to have\ngiven up that argument altogether.\nMR. MORAZZINI: Justice Sotomayor, I\ncertainly did not attempt or intend to concede that the\nNinth Circuit's opinion was correct in any sense in this\ncase.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you have conceded\nit by not appealing it, but okay. We're not -- your\ncase on labeling rises and falls on the sale to minors?\nMR. MORAZZINI: At this point, I would\nagree, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does California -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I gather that -- that if -\nif the parents of the minor want the kid to watch this\nviolent stuff, they like gore, they may even like\nviolent kids -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- then -- then the State\nof California has no objection, right? So long as the\nparent buys the thing, it's perfectly okay.\nMR. MORAZZINI: Your Honor, under Ginsberg,\nthey're entitled to direct the development and the\nupbringing of their children in the manner they see fit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. MORAZZINI: It's important to the State\nof California that the parent -- that we ensure that the\nparent can involve themselves in this important\ndecision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so that's basically\nall this is, is a -- a law to help parents; is that\nright?\nMR. MORAZZINI: It's one of the two\nfundamental interests that are served by this law, yes,\nensuring that parents can involve themselves in the\nfront end. California sought to erect a barrier in\nbetween a retail sales clerk and a minor with regard to\nviolent material, just as we allow for minors' access to\nsexual material, because California sees that the\ndevelopmental harm that could be caused to minors is no\nless significant than that recognized by this Court in\n-- in Ginsberg with regard to minors' exposure to sexual\nmaterial. Now, again, the material at issue in Ginsberg\nwas not obscene.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think there's any\nbarrier in California to minors' access to sexual\nmaterial?\nMR. MORAZZINI: I -- I believe California\nhas a law, Penal Code Section 313.1.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: California has a\nGinsberg-type law.\nMR. MORAZZINI: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does your office spend a lot\nof time enforcing that?\nMR. MORAZZINI: I'm not aware,\nJustice Alito. But there is a proscription on the sale\nof sexual material to minors. It's defined as harmful\nto minors, similar to California's Act. In fact,\nCalifornia's Act, in incorporating the three prongs of\nMiller, goes even further than the Ginsberg law at issue\nin Ginsberg v. New York.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- you've been\nasked questions about the vagueness of this and the\nproblem for the seller to know what's good and what's\nbad. California -- does California have any kind of an\nadvisory opinion, an office that will view these videos\nand say, yes, this belongs in this -- what did you call\nit -- deviant violence, and this one is just violent but\nnot deviant? Is there -- is there any kind of opinion\nthat the -- that the seller can get to know which games\ncan be sold to minors and which ones can't?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Not that I'm aware of,\nJustice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You should consider\ncreating such a thing. You might call it the California\noffice of censorship. It would -- it would judge each\nof these videos one by one. That would be very nice.\nMR. MORAZZINI: Your Honor, we -- we ask\njuries to judge sexual material and its appropriateness\nfor minors as well. I believe that if -- if we can view\nthe -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do we let the government do\nthat? Juries are not controllable. That's the\nwonderful thing about juries, also the worst thing about\njuries. But -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But do we let government\npass upon -- you know, a board of censors? I don't\nthink so.\nMR. MORAZZINI: Justice Scalia, California's\nnot doing that here. The standard is quite similar to\nthat in the sexual material realm. California is not\nacting as a censor. It is telling manufacturers and\ndistributors to look at your material and to judge for\nyourselves whether or not the level of violent content\nmeets the prongs of this definition.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I can see your white\nlight's on. But even if we get past what I think are\ndifficult questions about vagueness and how to interpret\nthis law, isn't there a less restrictive alternative\nwith the -- a V-chip?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Well, Your Honor, I believe\nyou're referring to the parental controls that are\navailable -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. MORAZZINI: -- on some of the new\nmachines. As we submitted in our briefing, a simple\nInternet search for bypassing parental controls brings\nup video clips instructing minors and young adults how\nto bypass the parental controls, so -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So V-chips don't work.\nMR. MORAZZINI: I believe the V-chip is\nlimited to television, Justice Kennedy.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nMorazzini.\nMR. MORAZZINI: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Smith.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe California law at issue restricts the\ndistribution of expressive works based on their content.\nCalifornia, as we've heard today, does not seriously\ncontend that it can satisfy the usual First Amendment\nstandards that apply to such a law. Instead, it's\nasking this Court to grant it a new free pass, a\nbrand-new Ginsberg-like exception to the First Amendment\nthat would deny constitutional protection to some\nill-defined subset of expressive works and, I submit,\nnot just video games, but necessarily movies, books, and\nany other expressive work that describes or portrays\nviolence in a way that some court somewhere, some day,\nwould decide is deviant and offensive.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- the\ndistinction between books and movies may be that, in\nthese video games, the child is not sitting there\npassively watching something; the child is doing the\nkilling. The child is doing the maiming. And I suppose\nthat might be understood to have a different impact on\nthe child's moral development.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, it might. The\n-- the State of California has not marshaled a shred of\nevidence to suggest it's true. And if you look at the\nsocial science -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was -- what was\nthe state of the record that was present before the\nCourt in Ginsberg?\nMR. SMITH: The state of the record was that\nthey were aware of science on both sides, but made a\njudgment that as a matter of common sense, they could\ndecide that obscenity, even somewhat at-large\nobscenity -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the Court acted\non the basis of common sense?\nMR. SMITH: Yes. It said as long as there's\nscience on both sides, but in that particular area,\nwhich is an exception based -- that goes back to the\nfounding, they felt that it was -- it was proper for\nthem to adjust the outer boundaries of the exception.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the material wasn't\nobscene. They were girlie magazines. I imagine to\ntoday's children they would seem rather tame -\nMR. SMITH: Well -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the magazines\ninvolved. But they were definitely not obscene with\nrespect to adults.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, that's\ncertainly true, but one of the things about the case\nthat is important to recognize, they didn't pass on the\nparticular material before the Court. They simply said,\nis this somewhat larger a definition of variable\nobscenity going to be acceptable to -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Talking about common sense,\nwhy isn't it common sense to say that if a parent wants\nhis 13-year-old child to have a game where the child is\ngoing to sit there and imagine he's a torturer and\nimpose gratuitous, painful, excruciating, torturing\nviolence upon small children and women, and do this for\nan hour or so, and there is no social or redeeming\nvalue, it's not artistic, it's not literary, et\ncetera -- why isn't it common sense to say a State has\nthe right to say, parent, if you want that for your\n13-year-old, you go buy it yourself. Which I think is\nwhat they're saying.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, the State has\nto have some reason to think that parents -\nJUSTICE BREYER: It does, it does. What it\nhas is -- and I've looked at the studies, perhaps not as\nthoroughly as you, but it seemed to me that Dr. Ferguson\nand Dr. Anderson are in a disagreement. They aren't in\nthat much of a disagreement actually, but they've looked\nin depth at a whole lot of video games, not movies\nthey're talking about or other things; they're talking\nabout video games.\nAnd both groups come to the conclusion that\nthere is some tendency to increase violence. And the\nAmerican Psychiatric -- Psychological Association and\nthe American Pediatric Association sign on to a long\nlist on -- I think it's the Anderson side that this does\nhurt children.\nI have to admit that if I'm supposed to be a\nsociological expert, I can't choose between them. But\nif I can say could a legislature have enough evidence to\nthink there's harm, the answer is yes.\nMR. SMITH: There is two aspects of harm.\nThe one I was about to address was the question of\nwhether parents need additional help in exercising the\nrole that they have played throughout the history -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. They need additional\nhelp because many parents are not home when their\nchildren come home from school. Many parents have jobs,\nI -- we hope. And -- and when -- when their children\nare there, they do what they want. And all this says\nis, if you want that gratuitous torture of, let's say\nbabies, to make it as bad as possible, what you do,\nparent, is you go buy it; don't let him buy it on his\nown, and he's 13 years old. Now, what's the common\nsense or what's the science of that?\nMR. SMITH: Well, two aspects. With respect\nto parental controls, Your Honor, there's a whole\nvariety -- a whole series of things that parents have\navailable to them and are using today to deal with any\nconcerns that they have about what's appropriate for\ntheir children.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't want to\ninterrupt your answer, but any 13-year-old can bypass\nparental controls in about 5 minutes.\nMR. SMITH: That is one element of about\nfive different elements, Your Honor. And if I could\ntalk about them -- there is the ratings. Parents are\ndoing the purchasing 90 percent of the time. Even if\nthe child does the purchasing, they bring the game home,\nthe parent can review it.\nThe game is being played in the home on the\nfamily television or computer most of the time. Any\nharm that's supposed to be inflicted on them is supposed\nto take place over a period of years, not minutes, so\nthe parent has ample opportunity to exercise parental\nsupervision over what games are being played in the\nhouse. Plus there is the parental controls, which are\nvery similar to the ones that the Court has found to be\nsignificant in the Playboy case, in the COPA case, in a\nwhole variety of cases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How much do these videos\ncost?\nMR. SMITH: They cost in the range of $50 to\n$60 when new, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not too many 13-year-olds\nwalk in with a $50 bill, do they?\nMR. SMITH: It seems very likely that the\npeople, if there are any out there, buying games without\nparental permission -- which the State, by the way, has\nnot even tried to show -- they are very likely in the\n16-year-old category. The -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're away from the common\nsense. If you're going back to the common sense of it,\nwhat common sense is there in having a state of the law\nthat a State can forbid and says to the parent the\nchild, the 13-year-old, cannot go in and buy a picture\nof a naked woman, but the 13-year-old child can go in\nand buy one of these video games as I have described?\nI've tried to take as bad a one as I could think of,\ngratuitous torture of children. Okay? Now, you can't\nbuy a naked woman, but you can go and buy that, you say\nto the 13-year-old. Now -- now, what sense is there to\nthat?\nMR. SMITH: Well, there's -- there's various\naspects of this that I think it's important to\nunderstand. First of all, violence has been a feature\nof works that we create for children and encouraged them\nto watch throughout the history of this country. We\nhave a very different sense of whether violence\nper se -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You mean love is not\nsomething that people have tried to encourage children\nto understand and know about? I mean, what's the\ndifference between sex and violence? Both, if anything?\nMR. SMITH: There's a huge difference. The\ndifference is -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you. I understand\nthat.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SMITH: We do not -- the difference is\nwe do not make films for children in which explicit sex\nhappens. We do make films for children in which graphic\nviolence happens -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Graphic violence.\nThere is a difference. We do not have a tradition in\nthis country of telling children they should watch\npeople actively hitting schoolgirls over the head with a\nshovel so they'll beg with mercy, being merciless and\ndecapitating them, shooting people in the leg so they\nfall down -- I'm reading from the district court\ndescription -- pour gasoline over them, set them on\nfire, and urinate on them. We do not have a tradition\nin this country. We protect children from that. We\ndon't actively expose them to that.\nMR. SMITH: And -- and parents have been\ndoing that for -- since time immemorial. The question\nbefore this Court is whether you're going to create an\nentirely new exception under the First Amendment,\nwhether parents need to have such a new exception\ncreated, and whether or not, if you're going to do it,\nyou could possibly figure out what the scope of that\nexception is.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it your position\n-- I know this is a facial challenge, Mr. Smith. So is\nit your position that the First Amendment could not\nprohibit the sale to minors of the video game that I\njust described?\nMR. SMITH: My position is that most people\nwould think that that's an inappropriate game for\nminors -- we do not try to sell it to minors -- but that\nthe Constitution should not be -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know you don't,\nbut what is -- you're avoiding the answer. Does the\nFirst Amendment protect the sale of that video to\nminors?\nMR. SMITH: My position -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A minor?\nMR. SMITH: -- is that there is not a\nviolence exception to the First Amendment for minors,\nand there should not be.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your position is\nthat the First Amendment does not, cannot, no matter\nwhat type of law, whether this one is vague or not, that\nthe State legislature cannot pass a law that says you\nmay not sell to a 10-year-old a video in which they set\nschoolgirls on fire.\nMR. SMITH: And the reason for that is\nthere's no possible way, it's an insuperable problem, to\nuse the English language to draw up an exception to the\nConstitution, to the First Amendment, that would -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But what if -- what if a\nState passes a -- what if California took the list of\nvideo games that your association rates as mature and\nsaid there's a civil penalty? And you apparently don't\nwant your -- you don't want vendors selling those games\nto minors; isn't that right?\nMR. SMITH: Exercising our First Amendment\nrights, we have decided -\nJUSTICE ALITO: You don't want that. And,\nnow, what if California said there's a civil penalty\nattached to that?\nMR. SMITH: What that would do is transform\nthe ESRB, the private voluntary system that exists, into\nthe -- the censorship commission that this Court struck\ndown in Interstate Circuit. When you -- when the\ngovernment does that and you have to go to them for\npermission to allow kids into the movies or to play this\ngame, it is a prior restraint. You have way too much\ndiscretion. It's a licensing authority that the First\nAmendment doesn't allow.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You seem to argue that -\nthat there really is no good reason to think that\nexposure to video games is -- is bad for minors,\nexposure to really violent video games is bad to minors;\nis that right?\nMR. SMITH: I think it's important to draw a\ndistinction between harm that could be cognizable under\nthe law and appropriateness. Families have different\njudgments that they make about their children at\ndifferent ages and with different content and different\nfamily values, and that's what -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Smith, is there\nany showing that the State could make that would satisfy\nyou, that would say, yes, that's a sufficient showing\nfor this law to go forward?\nYou know, I understand that you think that\nthe current studies don't suggest much of anything about\nharm.\nMR. SMITH: No, they don't.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But -- but are there studies\nthat would be enough?\nMR. SMITH: Well, I guess I can imagine a\nworld in which expression could transform 75 percent of\nthe people who experience it into murderers. That's\nclearly not the way the human mind works. And here the\nreality is quite the opposite. Dr. Anderson testified\nin the Illinois trial, which is in the record, that the\nvast majority of people playing the games will grow up\nand be just fine. And, in fact, he -- he acknowledged\nthat the effects of these games are not one whit\ndifferent from watching cartoons on television or\nreading violent passages in the Bible or looking at a\npicture of a gun.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So why -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you really don't want\nto argue the case on that ground. I -- I gather you\ndon't believe that the First Amendment reads: Congress\nshall make no law abridging the freedom of speech except\nthose that make sense. Is that -\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, my main ground today\nis exactly that, that this Court said last year in\nUnited States v. Stevens it doesn't have a freewheeling\nauthority to create new exceptions to the First\nAmendment after 200 years based on a cost-benefit\nanalysis, and this is -- this is a test of that. This\nis exactly what the State of California is asking you to\ndo.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But we have here a new -- a\nnew medium that cannot possibly have been envisioned at\nthe time when the First Amendment was ratified. It is\ntotally different from -- it's one thing to read a\ndescription of -- as one of these -- one of these video\ngames is promoted as saying, \"What's black and white and\nred all over? Perhaps the answer could include\ndisposing of your enemies in a meat grinder.\" Now,\nreading that is one thing. Seeing it as graphically\nportrayed -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And doing it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- and doing it is still a\nthird thing.\nSo this presents a question that could not\nhave been specifically contemplated at the time when the\nFirst Amendment was adopted. And to say, well, because\nnobody was -- because descriptions in a book of violence\nwere not considered a category of speech that was\nappropriate for limitation at the time when the First\nAmendment was violated is entirely artificial.\nMR. SMITH: We do have a new medium here,\nYour Honor, but we have a history in this country of new\nmediums coming along and people vastly overreacting to\nthem, thinking the sky is falling, our children are all\ngoing to be turned into criminals.\nIt started with the crime novels of the late\n19th century, which produced this raft of legislation\nwhich was never enforced. It started with comic books\nand movies in the 1950s. There were hearings across the\nstreet in the 1950s where social scientists came in and\nintoned to the Senate that half the juvenile delinquency\nin this country was being caused by reading comic books,\nand there was enormous pressure on the industry. They\ncensored -- they self-censored. We have television. We\nhave rock lyrics. We have the Internet.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Smith, do you think all\nvideo games are speech in the first instance? Because\nyou could look at these games and say they're the\nmodern-day equivalent of Monopoly sets. They're games.\nThey're things that people use to compete. You know,\nwhen you think about some of them -- the first video\ngame was Pong. It was playing tennis on your TV. How\nis that speech at all?\nMR. SMITH: The games that we are talking\nabout have narrative, events that are occurring,\ncharacters, plot. And that's exactly what the State has\nset out to regulate here. It says if these events occur\nhere -- there is violence, one person is hurting another\nperson -- it has to be a human being who's the victim -\nand it's doing it in a -- in a way that they find\noffensive in some way, we're going to regulate it. So,\nobviously, what -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So are we going to separate\nvideo games into narrative video games and non-narrative\nvideo games?\nMR. SMITH: You don't have to, as long as\nthe law is limited to regulating narrative. That's what\nthis law is limited to. Now, if the law said you\nshouldn't buy -- play games that have red images that\nappear in them, or something else that was somehow\nnon-content based, that might be a closer case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what -- what about a\nlaw that says you can't sell to minors a video game -\nit doesn't care what the plot is, but no video game in\nwhich the minor commits violent acts of maiming,\nkilling, setting people on fire? What about that?\nWould that -- would that be regulating speech?\nMR. SMITH: Well, of course, Your Honor.\nThat's exactly what -- what -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not speech. You're\nsaying you just can't let the kid maim -- maim, kill -\nMR. SMITH: I'm sorry. Were you -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- or set on fire. What\nthe law would be directed at is not the plot, not the\nvideo game itself, but the child's act of -- of\ncommitting murder, maiming, and so forth.\nMR. SMITH: Well, the events in a video game\nare -- what happens in the plot is a combination of what\nthe game gives you and what the player adds to it.\nThere's a -- there's a creative aspect coming at it from\nthe other side. It's often referred to as a dialogue\nbetween the player and the game. I would submit that\nboth are completely protected by the First Amendment.\nJust as a person actually -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The child is speaking to\nthe game?\nMR. SMITH: No. The child is helping to\nmake the plot, determine what happens in the events that\nappear on the screen, just as an actor helps to portray\nwhat happens in a play. You're acting out certain\nelements of the play, and you're contributing to the\nevents that occur and adding a creative element of your\nown. That's what makes them different and in many ways\nwonderful.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Smith, your -\nyour challenge is a facial challenge?\nMR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that under -\nwhether you use the Salerno test or the Glucksberg test,\nif there is either one or any applications that would\nsatisfy the Constitution, the facial challenge fails.\nRight?\nMR. SMITH: Very clear under the law of this\nCourt that those tests don't apply in a First Amendment\ncontext if the -- the -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought we\nreferenced them last year in the Stevens case, and the\nonly reason we didn't have to decide which applies is\nbecause we adopted an approach that looked at\noverbreadth and said this statute is overbroad and\nspecifically didn't decide whether it could be applied\nin that case to -- to crush videos.\nMR. SMITH: Well, that's -- that's correct,\nYour Honor, but I think it's -- there's no argument\nhere, I don't think, that if you can find one game out\nthere to which this can constitutionally be applied,\neven though it would also be unconstitutionally applied\nunder the vast run of other cases -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I\nunderstood -- the tenor of much of the questioning, I\nthink, is that there may be games and may be minors -\nmaybe a less violent game sold to a 17-year-old, perhaps\nthat violates the First Amendment, but something like\nPostal 2 sold to a 10-year-old might -- might well not\nviolate the First Amendment to apply this law to that.\nMR. SMITH: Well, that may be -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the way we\napproached the issue in Stevens, where we had hunting\nvideos and crush videos, would say that it's too broad\nto apply the law to everything, so we strike it down,\nit's overbroad, but leave open the possibility that a\nmore narrowly drawn statute might pass muster.\nWhy -- why isn't that a good approach here?\nMR. SMITH: You certainly could do that.\nCertainly, the key thing is that you strike down this\nlaw, because this law is clearly much broader than any\none game. I would submit to you, though, that there's\nno way, in fact, anybody is going to be able to come\nback and draw a statute that gets to what they claim,\nbecause the English language is not susceptible of that\nlevel of precision.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So it's not\nsusceptible. Throughout you've been arguing your point,\nwhich is fair. You have some experts who -- who favor\nyou, and you make that point very strongly, and your\npoint's a pretty good one and a serious one, that it's\nvery hard to draw this line under traditional First\nAmendment standards.\nBut I'd like you to deal with their point\nfor a moment. And I take it their point is: There is\nno new First Amendment thing here. There is a\ncategory -- call them X -- which really are involving\nthings like torturing children, et cetera. Maybe you\ndon't like to sell them to anybody. You have them X'd\nor some special thing. But they exist, and they fit\nwithin a Miller-type definition. They are much worse\nthan the simple girlie magazine that was involved there.\nAnd they will use traditional First Amendment tests;\nthat is to say, there is speech at issue, that speech is\nbeing limited, it is being done for a good reason,\ncompelling interest -- namely, this problem with the X\nvideos and the torture and living it through -- and\nthere is no less restrictive alternative that isn't also\nsignificantly less effective.\nSee, I want you to deal with that directly,\nbecause what you have been doing for the most part is\nsaying we have to be in some new, total new area, et\ncetera. But their argument is you don't have to be in\nsome totally new area, et cetera. Apply traditional\nFirst Amendment standards, and we win. That's their\nargument, and I'd like to hear what you have to say\nabout that, specifically.\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, they do not suggest\nthat there's any existing exception to the First\nAmendment that would apply to violence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is not an exception.\nIt is the traditional strict scrutiny First Amendment\ntest.\nMR. SMITH: Well, they make a feint at\ntrying to argue that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then let's -\nto get you to focus on it, I'll say I've made the\nargument.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SMITH: There you go. Your Honor, I\nthink if you apply strict scrutiny here, they do not\ncome close to the kind of showing that would be required\nunder -- under the First Amendment.\nFirst of all, they have not shown any\nproblem, let alone a compelling problem, requiring\nregulation here in a world where parents are fully\nempowered already to make these calls, where crime,\nincluding violent crime, since the introduction of these\ngames, has been plummeting in this country, down 50\npercent since the day Doom first went on the market\n15 years ago; in a world where parents are fully aware\nof what's going on in their homes and aware of the\nratings system and can use all the other tools that we\nhave talked about -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they have plenty of\nevidence that -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why couldn't you make the\nsame arguments with respect to the obscenity statutes?\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, because\nobscenity doesn't have strict scrutiny applied to it, if\nit did, I expect you could make the same arguments, if\nthere were -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why shouldn't violence be\ntreated the same as obscenity?\nMR. SMITH: Well, because, first of all, we\ndon't have the same history of it. There's no\nhistorical pedigree of that kind of an exception. And,\nas I was suggesting earlier, there's a fundamental\ndifference factually, which is Ginsberg works tolerably\nwell because we take everything that's sexually explicit\nand appeals to a prurient interest, and we say over\nhere, it's not appropriate for minors.\nViolence would require you to draw a much\ndifferent line between acceptable protected violence and\nunacceptable unprotected violence for minors, and that\ngiven the lack of historical pedigree but also just\ngiven the nature of what you're trying to do -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the courts -\nMR. SMITH: -- that's a -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The courts struggled for\nmany, many years and are to some extent still struggling\nwith obscenity. They came up with basically what we\nmight call the Miller standards. And -- and the State\nhas said this gives us a category that we can work with,\nwith reference to violence.\nMR. SMITH: And if you take the Miller\nstandards and you take two things out of it -- you take\nout of it explicit sex and nudity, and you take out an\nappeal to prurient interest -- what do you have left?\nYou have left -- what you have is a structure with no\napparent meaning. There is no way to know how a court\nwould apply a standard like deviant violence, morbid\nviolence, offensive violence, let alone decide which\nvideo games have a redeeming social, political, artistic\nvalue.\nThe value of a video game is completely in\nthe eye of the beholder. Some would say they're\nbeautiful works of artistic creation; others would\nsay -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You could make all those\narguments with reference to obscenity.\nMR. SMITH: Except that you know -- we know,\nwe all know, at least with respect to Ginsberg -- adult\nobscenity, I would acknowledge, is a very difficult\nline. Adult -- Ginsberg works reasonably well, because\nif it has sex in it and naked people having sex in it\nand it's designed to be appealing to people's prurient\ninterests, you don't give it to minors. And you don't\nhave a lot of cases out there about that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and you started\nGinsberg with something that is proscribable even with\nregard to adults.\nMR. SMITH: Correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know that there is such\na thing as -- as obscenity, which can be proscribed even\n-- even as to adults; whereas in this case, I don't know\nthat there's such a thing as morbid violence which could\nbe eliminated from ordinary movies.\nMR. SMITH: Let me -- I think a little\nhistory is helpful here. This Court has twice dealt\nwith laws attempting to regulate violent works in the\npast. One was in Winters v. New York, where law applied\nto magazines and books, and one was in the 1960s. On\nthe very day Ginsberg came down, in the Interstate\nCircuit case, the City of Dallas had an ordinance where\nthere was going to be a commission that was going to\nreview each movie and decide if it was appropriate for\nchildren.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Let me be clear about\nexactly what your argument is. Your argument is that\nthere is nothing that a State can do to limit minors'\naccess to the most violent, sadistic, graphic video game\nthat can be developed. That's your argument?\nMR. SMITH: My position is -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is it or isn't it?\nMR. SMITH: My position is that strict\nscrutiny applies, and that given the facts in the\nrecord, given the fact that the -- the problem is\nalready well controlled, the parents are already\nempowered, and there are greatly less alternatives out\nthere -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, when you -\nMR. SMITH: -- there isn't any basis to say\nscrutiny is satisfied.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, when you say that -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, just to be\nclear, your answer to Justice Alito is, at this point,\nthere is nothing the State can do?\nMR. SMITH: Because there's no problem it\nneeds to solve that would justify -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I -- could I\njust have a simple answer?\nMR. SMITH: The answer is yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's nothing the\nState can do.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Smith, how can you\nsay that? There's plenty of proof that -- that children\nare going into stores and buying these games despite the\nvoluntary rating system, despite the voluntary retailer\nrestraint by some. There's still proof out there, and\nan abundance of it, that kids are buying the games.\nMR. SMITH: I disagree.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And there's proof that\nsome parents, as well-intentioned as they may or may not\nbe, have not been able to supervise that. So I -\nstarting from the proposition that there is a problem,\nit's a compelling State need, why are you arguing that\nthere is no solution that the State could use to address\nthat problem?\nMR. SMITH: The -- the existing solutions\nare perfectly capable of allowing this problem to be\naddressed, assuming it is a problem. And I would -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's still about 20\npercent of sales are going to kids.\nMR. SMITH: That's when they send in\nsomebody who's 16 to test the system. There isn't any\nevidence at all in this record that actual children, not\ntesters, are in fact disobeying their parents and\nsecretly buying these games, bringing them into the\nhome, and playing them for years with their parents\nunaware of it. There's simply no evidence of that at\nall.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you have a law\nthat says the State has to put -- the dealers have to\nput the violent video games in a particular area of the\nvideo store?\nMR. SMITH: There -- there is -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That is not -- and\nthen -- you know, and minors are not allowed in that\narea.\nMR. SMITH: Well, if what you're saying is\nyou're going to have a limit on the ability of minors to\nbuy them because of walled off, and minors are not\nallowed -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. SMITH: -- to go pick them off the\nshelf, then I don't know how that differs from the\ncurrent law, Your Honor, assuming you could figure\nout -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your answer -- your answer\nto the first question of Justice Alito and the Chief\nJustice was yes, isn't that -- that you are saying\nthere's nothing they can do. So now, am I right about\nthat or am I not right?\nMR. SMITH: Yes. Strict scrutiny does not\nmake sense -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I am right? Okay. All I\nwanted was an answer to that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they can't say,\nexample, all the -- all the highest rated videos have to\nbe on the top shelf out of the reach of children. Can\nthey do that?\nMR. SMITH: I would think that that's\nprobably not -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what they do\nwith cigarettes or something, isn't it?\nMR. SMITH: Except that cigarettes are not\nspeech, Your Honor. This is fully protected speech.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know that\ncigarettes are not speech, Mr. Smith.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Cigarettes are\nsomething that we have determined are harmful to\nchildren. The question is, you say the record doesn't\nsupport the idea that these video games are harmful to\nchildren. Some of us may conclude that it does.\nMR. SMITH: Well, surely the record doesn't\nsupport it. The record says that if -- even if you take\nthe studies at face value, it's not one whit more\nharmful than watching television cartoons. That's what\nthe record shows.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But on that -- on that\nscore, Mr. Smith, there is a study by the FCC. The\nquestion is whether violence can be restricted during\nthe hours when most children are awake, just the way\npornography is. I don't remember what -- what are the\nhours, that -- something like from 10:00 in the evening\nuntil -\nI don't -- but -- but didn't the FCC say,\nyes, we could do the same thing for violence that we're\ndoing for sex, except we don't think we ought to do it;\nwe think Congress should do it?\nMR. SMITH: What they did was they spent\nseveral years trying to come up with a definition that\nwould allow anybody to figure out which violent TV shows\nhave to be put into this adult category and which don't,\nand they eventually punted and said we have no idea how\nto do that; Congress asked us to do it; we cannot do it;\nand they punted it back to Congress to try to come up\nwith a definition.\nThis is a very difficult task, trying to use\nlanguage to differentiate levels of violence or types of\nviolence in a manner that would in some way tell people\nwhat the rules of the game are. I think, even if you\nthink that there's some problem out there that needs to\nbe solved, you ought to think very carefully about\nwhether or not you're going to authorize the creation of\nsome new rule authorizing regulation in this area, when\nno one will have any idea what the scope of it is.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And you say there's no\nproblem because 16-year-olds in California never have\n$50 available to go buy a video game and because they\nnever have TVs in their room, and their parents are\nalways home watching what they -- they do with their\nvideo games, and the parents -- and the video games have\nfeatures that allow parents to block access, to block\nthe playing of violent video games, which can't be\novercome by a computer-savvy California 16-year-old;\nthat's why there's no problem, right?\nMR. SMITH: I guess, if what we're really\ngoing to do is judge the constitutionality of this law\nbased on what 16- and 17-year-olds are getting and\nwhether that would be harmful to them, I think the\nproblem there is the line between 16 and 17 and 18 is so\nfine, that you're not going to be able to identify any\nreal category of games that fits into that category.\nAnd it's important, by the way, to -- to\nnote that California hasn't told us whether we should\njudge it for 5-year-olds, 10-year-olds, 17-year-olds.\nIf it's 5-year-olds, then it's vastly over-restrictive;\nif it's 17-year-olds, I suspect -- I suspect it wouldn't\nrestrict anything because nobody is going to be able to\nconvince a -- jury, well, this is an 18-year-old game,\nnot a 17-year-old game.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We draw that kind of\nline of course in the death penalty area, don't we?\nBetween 18-year-olds? You are under 18; you can't be\nsentenced to life without parole; if you were over 18,\nyou can.\nMR. SMITH: You do draw that line, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And we do it for\ndrinking; we do it for driving.\nMR. SMITH: But here you're assessing works\nof expression and trying to decide what age they -- they\nwould correspond to, and I don't think you can cut it\nthat finely and say, well, this is an 18 game; this is\nonly a 17 game. I just don't think that works. So if\nthat's the test, the test Justice Breyer suggested it\nought to be, then the statute essentially would restrict\nnothing. If the test is 5-year-olds -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Stick to the X things,\nmaybe. Maybe it would restrict the total gratuitous\ntorture. And if that's what it restricted, why is that\nsuch a terrible thing?\nMR. SMITH: Well, first of all -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And as you experimented\nwith other things, as they did in the obscenity area,\nyou could discover you could limit it to that.\nMR. SMITH: I think the \"maybe\" is telling,\nthough, Your Honor. Somebody, as Justice Scalia pointed\nout, in publishing a game has to know what -- what to -\nwhat the rules of the game are in advance, subject to\nhundreds of millions of dollars of penalties. There's a\n$1,000 a game penalty if you have the wrong -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you have your rules,\nso why wouldn't the first step be they'd follow your\nrules? Your rules. The X things would be limited to\npeople who are over 18, and we'll see if we ever get\nprosecuted for a different one. And you might never.\nMR. SMITH: Our rules wouldn't help you at\nall. They say that -- that -- they're only restricting\na smaller number, a small subset of M-rated games,\nwhich, by the way, we say are appropriate for\n17-year-olds. So you have -- these ratings that the\nState wants us to impose are going to conflict with the\nratings that are already on the packaging which are\nbeing used by parents every day to make these judgments.\nSo it's actually interfering -- the prospect of it would\ninterfere with the information already on the packaging.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nSmith.\nMr. Morazzini, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ZACKERY P. MORAZZINI\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. MORAZZINI: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nI wanted to address one point that has been\nraised about minors' ability to access these games.\nYes, new games do cost $60, but California's law also\nregulates the rental of these video games, which is just\na few dollars per game. So minors certainly can afford\nthem and can access them.\nBut I also wanted to draw out the point that\nCalifornia's law really is not an ordinance that's\ndirected to a plot of a game. It's expressly directed\nto games with essentially no plot, no artistic value.\nThis is the helpful nature of the third prong of the\nMiller standard. So it really is only going after the\nnature of the game where the child is acting out -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. If it has a\nplot, it has artistic value? Is that going to be the\ntest for artistic value? Anything that has a plot?\nMR. MORAZZINI: It will be one factor to be\nconsidered, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well -\nMR. MORAZZINI: The nature of the plot and\nthe nature of the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, one factor to be\nconsidered, sure. But you're not telling us that, so\nlong as it has a plot, it's okay?\nMR. MORAZZINI: No. Your Honor, as this\nCourt held in the Jacobellis case, a single quotation\nfrom Voltaire on the flyleaf of an otherwise obscene\nwork was not going to make that work non-obscene.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can't have artistic\nvideos that involve maiming and cutting off heads and\neviscerating people, and pouring gas, right? So long as\nits artistic, it's okay.\nMR. MORAZZINI: No, if the -- if the level\nof the violence -- just as in obscenity, if the level of\nthe violence causes the game as a whole to lack the\nartistic -- it's -- it's a balance, Your Honor, just as\nit is with sexual material. Each aspect -- that's why\nviolence and sex are so similar -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Artistic for whom? For a\n5-year-old? What a 5-year-old would appreciate as great\nart, is that going to be the test?\nMR. MORAZZINI: No. Again, minors as a\nclass. So those under 18 years old. Those under -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think Mortal Kombat\nis prohibited by this statute?\nMR. MORAZZINI: I believe it's a candidate,\nYour Honor, but I haven't played the game and been\nexposed to it sufficiently to judge for myself.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: It's a candidate, meaning,\nyou know, yes, a reasonable jury could find that Mortal\nKombat -- which is, you know, an iconic game, which I'm\nsure half of the clerks who work for us spent\nconsiderable amounts of time in their adolescence\nplaying.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MORAZZINI: Justice Kagan -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what she's\ntalking about.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MORAZZINI: Justice Kagan, by\n\"candidate,\" I meant that the video game industry should\nlook at it, should take a long look at it. Now -- but I\ndon't know off the top of my head. I'm willing to state\nright here in open court that the video game Postal 2,\nyes, would be covered by this Act. I'm willing to guess\nthat games we described in our brief, such as MadWorld,\nwould be covered by the Act. I think the video game\nindustry -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would a video game that\nportrayed a Vulcan, as opposed to a human being, being\nmaimed and tortured -- would that be covered by the Act?\nMR. MORAZZINI: No, it wouldn't, Your Honor,\nbecause the Act is only directed towards the range of\noptions that are able to be inflicted on a human being.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if the -- if the\nvideo producer says this is not a human being, it's an\nandroid computer-simulated person, then that doesn't -\nall they have to do is put a little part or feature on\nthe creature and they could sell the video game?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Under the Act, yes, because\nCalifornia's concern -- I think this is one of the\nreasons that sex and violence are so similar. These are\nbase physical acts we're talking about, Justice\nSotomayor. So limiting, narrowing our law here in\nCalifornia -- there in California -- to violence,\nviolent depictions against human beings -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what happens when the\ncharacter gets maimed, head chopped off, and immediately\nafter it happens they spring back to life and they\ncontinue their battle? Is that covered by your Act?\nBecause they haven't been maimed and killed forever.\nJust temporarily.\nMR. MORAZZINI: I would think so. The\nintent of the law is to limit minors' access to those\ngames -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You think so? Isn't\nthat feedback to Justice Scalia's question?\nMR. MORAZZINI: Well, Your Honor, this -\nthis is a facial challenge. This -- this statute has\nnot been applied, has not been even construed by a State\nor Federal court below, but -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Smith.\nMR. MORAZZINI: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is\nsubmitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n41:24 18:10,11 29:12,13 46:7 48:12 56:9
