        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in No. 00-507, the Chickasaw Nation v.\nthe United States.\nMr. Luthey.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GRAYDON D. LUTHEY, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. LUTHEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations ask this Court\nto hold that Congress has afforded tribes the same\nexemption from Federal wagering taxes enjoyed by State\ngovernmental wagering operations.\nWe do not base our claim on policy untethered to\nstatutory text, but instead we base our claim today on\nsection 20(d) of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act codified\nat 25 U.S.C., section 2719(d).\nUnfortunately, for all concerned, that statutory\ntext is ambiguous, as every appellate judge which has\nexamined it has held either expressly or implicitly, and\nas we expect the Government to admit today if the question\nis put to them.\nOne of the possible constructions of that\nambiguous statute, based on its text and structure and\ngiving effect to every word of the statute and bolstered\nby its legislative history, is that the tax exemption\nafforded States by Internal Revenue Code chapter 35,\nexpressly referenced in section 2719(d), applies equally\nto tribal wagering operations.\nQUESTION: Where do we find this exact text that\nyou're talking about in the brief or in --\nMR. LUTHEY: I would direct Your Honor to the\npetitioner's appendix 90a, to our appendix for certiorari.\nQUESTION: Haven't you set it out on page 3?\nMR. LUTHEY: Yes, sir. It's also there.\nQUESTION: On page 3 of your brief? That's a\nhandier reference then I think.\nMR. LUTHEY: Now, starting with the actual text\nof the statute, we believe that the statute contains two\ncentral textual commands: one that has to do with the\nreporting and withholding of taxes from gaming -- from --\nfrom the winnings from gaming, and also the application of\nthe Internal Revenue Code provisions concerning wagering\noperations. It's the tribes' contention that these are\ntwo distinct concepts involving distinct provisions of the\nInternal Revenue Code.\nAnd we find the basis for the distinction in two\nplaces. One is the disjunctive or that connects gaming\nand wagering operations, and the additional support we\nfind is in the parenthetical that precedes the reference\nto these two discrete concepts.\nAnd if the Court would look at the parenthetical\nthat leads in this statute and gives five separate\nexamples of portions of the Internal Revenue Code that\nCongress intended to apply --\nQUESTION: Before you -- before you proceed\nfurther with this argument that you make in your reply\nbrief, did you present it, this or distinguishing gaming\non the one hand from wagering operations? Did you present\nthat to the Tenth Circuit?\nMR. LUTHEY: Not directly like that, Your Honor,\nwe did not.\nQUESTION: And did you present it in your\nopening brief?\nMR. LUTHEY: What we did, Your Honor, in the\nopening brief is adopt the decision by the majority in the\nLittle Six decision from the Federal circuit.\nQUESTION: Which does not make this argument.\nMR. LUTHEY: No. We made this argument in\ndirect reply to the Government's assertion in its answer\nbrief that there is only one central textual command;\nnamely, the Government would have you believe that the\nstatute applies only to --\nQUESTION: Well, you've answered the question.\nYou raised it for the first time in your reply brief.\nMR. LUTHEY: To address specifically, Your\nHonor, the Government's position which we claim is based\non a false premise.\nQUESTION: Well, that was not a new position.\nThe Government had always said that this is how it should\nbe read, and the fact is that what you say is the -- is\nthe meaning of it was a meaning that didn't occur to you\nuntil -- until the reply brief. I mean, I think that\nsuggests how implausible a reading it is. Surely, this\nargument should have been made much sooner if -- if it was\nso -- so evident.\nI mean, the way -- why don't you read the\nprovision the way -- the way you would have us read it?\nIt is --\nMR. LUTHEY: The way we would have the provision\nread, Your Honor, is set out at page 9.\nQUESTION: Page what?\nMR. LUTHEY: Page 9 of the reply brief where we\nsuggest that concerning addresses two distinct central\ntextual commands in -- in contradiction, Your Honor, to\nthe Government's assertion that there is one central\ntextual command.\nQUESTION: Right. And you would say that the\nway to read it is, concerning the -- the way it reads, if\none would read it normally, is, concerning the reporting\nand withholding of taxes with respect to the winnings from\ngaming or wagering operations. Now, the normal mind would\nsay with respect to the winnings from gaming or wagering\noperations, but you want to read it concerning, A, the\nreporting and withholding of taxes with respect to the\nwinnings from gaming or, B, wagering operations. And\nthat's just a very strained reading of it, it seems to me.\nMR. LUTHEY: Your Honor, if I could respond.\nQUESTION: I wish you would.\nMR. LUTHEY: I -- I think our reading is\ninformed by the parenthetical reference that precedes\nthese two concepts, and particularly the text and\nstructure of that parenthetical reference. The\nparenthetical reference identifies five particular\nportions of the Internal Revenue Code. The first three,\nsections 1441, 3402(q), and 6041, clearly apply to\nconcerning the reporting and withholding of taxes with\nrespect to the winnings from gaming. There's no doubt\nabout that. The --\nQUESTION: And not the winnings from wagering.\nMR. LUTHEY: From gaming.\nQUESTION: But not from wagering.\nMR. LUTHEY: It's from gaming by players, Your\nHonor.\nThen you get to the second part of the\nparenthetical --\nQUESTION: But would you explain to me? I\nthought that gaming -- a gaming operations or wagering\noperations -- perhaps you can clarify what is the\ndifference between gaming as a noun and wagering\noperations?\nMR. LUTHEY: It's our -- and you hit right\nexactly on the point, Your Honor. It's our position that\ngaming is a noun and the wagering refers to operations.\nAnd the way that you can see that is by the specific\ndivision in the parenthetical examples. The first three\nhave to do with the reporting and withholding of taxes\nfrom winnings by players from gaming. The last two,\nsection --\nQUESTION: But not the winnings by players from\nwagering.\nMR. LUTHEY: No. From gaming. That's correct.\nQUESTION: And what -- what is the difference\nbetween those two?\nMR. LUTHEY: The difference is how it is used in\nthe context of this statute. And the difference is again\nillustrated by the division within the five express\nillustrations contained in the parenthetical.\nQUESTION: If you could tell me concretely what\nis the difference between winnings from gaming and\nwinnings from wagering operations.\nMR. LUTHEY: Winnings from gaming here refers to\nwinnings by the players from gaming, money paid to players\nas a result of gaming, winnings from what the players do.\nQUESTION: Is there a difference, just in the\nEnglish language, between gaming and wagering?\nMR. LUTHEY: They -- they could be regarded\nsynonymous if both are used as nouns, Mr. Chief Justice,\nor both are used as adjectives.\nHere we -- we contend that the distinction is\ninformed by the parenthetical. If you look at the last\ntwo --\nQUESTION: May I just ask? Under your reading,\nwhat -- using Justice Scalia's A and B, what function does\nA play?\nMR. LUTHEY: What function A plays is that the\ntax is imposed on the winnings from gaming as a result of\nwhat the players have won.\nQUESTION: Wouldn't that have been picked up\nanyway, just in your reading from wagering on?\nMR. LUTHEY: Not necessarily because when you\nget to the second set, Your Honor, particularly 6050I and\nchapter 35, the text of those provisions have nothing to\ndo with winnings.\nQUESTION: No. But -- but if it just read\nconcerning wagering operations, just leave out all of the\nA part, if it said concerning wagering operations, it\nwould pick up those provisions that require wagering\noperations to withhold and report the winning -- the\nwinnings of players. The provisions you're referring to\nare not the provisions that imposed the tax on the\nplayers. They're the provisions that require the wagering\noperations to withhold that tax and to report it. Isn't\nthat right?\nMR. LUTHEY: Well --\nQUESTION: So, wouldn't that have been covered\njust as easily by simply saying concerning wagering\noperations?\nMR. LUTHEY: Well, section 1441 and 3402\nactually do impose a tax, a percentage of tax, that is on\nthe winnings from gaming. Chapter 35 --\nQUESTION: That's the chapter we're -- okay,\nthat's the --\nMR. LUTHEY: Chapter 35 is different, Your\nHonor. Chapter 35 imposes no tax on anyone from winnings.\nChapter 35 imposes a -- a tax on the operator based on the\nwagers that have been received, not the money that the\noperator has paid out.\nQUESTION: All right.\nQUESTION: Let me put it this way, and it's\nsuggested by Justice Ginsburg's line of questioning. Does\nthe Internal Revenue Code require any withholding of\nwinnings from wagering operations?\nMR. LUTHEY: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: Well, then that, it seems to me,\ndestroys your argument because you -- you are -- you want\nto say that gaming covers the entire universe of winnings\nthat are subject to withholding. But then you answered my\nquestion there are also winnings from wagering that are\nsubject to withholding. And your way of parsing the\nstatute does not permit withholding for that.\nMR. LUTHEY: If you --\nQUESTION: So, it seems to me that -- that\ndestroys the distinction you're trying to make which is\nwhat Justice Ginsburg's line of questioning, it seemed,\nsuggested to me at least.\nMR. LUTHEY: With respect, Your Honor, if you\nlook at wagering and gaming as nouns, they could be read\nto refer to the same thing. If you look at wagering\noperations on one hand as a concept that's distinct from\nthe reporting and withholding of taxes from gaming, it's\nanother matter entirely.\nAnd the problem is here chapter 35, which is\nexpressly referenced in the parenthetical, applies to\nwagering operations, not to the reporting and withholding\nof taxes on gaming. It has nothing to do with it.\nQUESTION: The oddity of the argument to me is\nthat the -- you're -- I think your explanation is assuming\nthat the basic activity that's going on in a casino, which\nis giving rise to each of these different kinds of\nliability, is the same activity. And -- and you're\ncalling it -- you're calling it gaming when the card\nplayer plays blackjack, but you're calling it wagering\nwhen the blackjack casino has to withhold money. And that\nseems very odd to me, but maybe I don't understand your\nargument.\nQUESTION: I guess you're calling it wagering\noperations, not wagering. Is that right?\nMR. LUTHEY: That's -- that's exactly correct,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: Yes, but the operation -- the\nwagering operation for one purpose is gaming for another\npurpose, and that -- as I understand your argument, and\nthat's just a very strange and confusing usage to impute\nto the Congress.\nMR. LUTHEY: With respect, Your Honor, if -- if\nthe statute is read closely, the first three provisions of\nthe parenthetical apply to concerning the reporting and\nwithholding of taxes with respect to the winnings. Then\nwe're told what the winnings come from. We have taxes on\nwinnings.\nQUESTION: They come gaming under your argument.\nMR. LUTHEY: They come from gaming.\nThen we have two additional provisions\nidentified: 6050I of the Internal Revenue Code and\nchapter 35 --\nQUESTION: That's reporting and withholding, and\nthe activity of the reporting and withholding is not\ngaming, but wagering operation. Is that right?\nMR. LUTHEY: No.\nQUESTION: Is that your argument?\nMR. LUTHEY: I'm not being clear here. 6050I\nand chapter 35 have nothing to do with reporting and\nwithholding. Nothing to do with reporting and\nwithholding. And that's been our position consistently,\nand the Government will concede that.\nQUESTION: Well, don't they impose -- don't they\nimpose an excise tax on operators?\nMR. LUTHEY: They do.\nQUESTION: Gaming and wagering? If you -- if\nyou have a casino, you have to pay an excise tax?\nMR. LUTHEY: That's correct.\nQUESTION: A Federal excise tax.\nMR. LUTHEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And you're arguing that the Indian\ntribes that operate the casinos were given somehow the\nsame exemption from that that States are when States\noperate lotteries or some kind of gambling operations.\nMR. LUTHEY: Other type of wagering operation,\nYour Honor. That's correct.\nAnd one of the things that we believe informs\nour construction of this has to do with the legislative\nhistory --\nQUESTION: Before you get to that -- I can take\na break when you get to that.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Before you do, I have -- I have\nanother textual problem with your interpretation, and for\nthis purpose, you can't use page 3 of your brief. You\nhave to look on page 90a of the appendix to the petition\nfor a writ of certiorari, which -- which contains the\nwhole provision and not just the -- the portion of it that\npage 3 quotes.\nYou want us to read the -- the phrase with\nrespect to the winnings from gaming -- A, with respect to\nthe winnings from gaming or, B, wagering operations in the\nmiddle of that paragraph as a separate A and B. But the\nparagraph continues: shall apply to Indian gaming\noperations conducted or under blah-blah in the same manner\nas such -- as such provisions apply to State gaming and\nwagering operations.\nNow, does it mean in the same manner as such\nprovisions apply to State gambling -- to, A, State gaming?\nDo any State constitutions allow the State to -- you know,\nto gamble with the public funds? See what I'm saying? At\nthe end of it, State -- you can't possibly read it as:\napply to State gaming on the one hand and wagering\noperations on the other because States don't game. You\nhave to read it as an adjective there. State gaming\noperations.\nMR. LUTHEY: At the end of -- at the end of the\nstatute, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Yes. You want to read it one way at\nthe end and another way in the middle. That doesn't --\nQUESTION: Well, when you say gaming at the\nmiddle, don't you mean gaming by a player in a casino?\nMR. LUTHEY: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: Okay, and isn't that what you would\nalso mean when the word gaming is used at the end?\nMR. LUTHEY: Well, this is --\nQUESTION: I may not buy your argument, but I'm\nnot sure that I see the inconsistency.\nMR. LUTHEY: That's right. And this is part of\nthe ambiguity.\nQUESTION: If you're going to go to legislative\nhistory, why doesn't it all become clear? Originally\nthere was a bill that had the word not only the reporting\nbut also taxation. As the bill was originally reported,\nit said you apply to Indian tribes the same way as you\napply to States laws that concern, one, taxation; two,\nreporting of taxes; three, withholding of taxes.\nNow, we have two possible explanations of what\nhappened. They cut out the word taxation and they changed\nit to the present. Explanation number one which would\njustify what you just said in the last 15 minutes. It got\ninto the hands of a real drafting nut.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Now, I've met people who can clear\nstatutes and make them totally obscure. Choice one is\nthat's what happened.\nChoice two is what happened is they changed it\nto mean just what the Government said. They cut out\ntaxation, they left reporting, and the number 35 is there\nas an accident, an error, a leftover, a number that no one\ncaught and no one changed, though they should have done\nit.\nNow, I see explanation one and explanation two,\nand maybe you have a third one. If so, I'd like to know\nit; if not, I'd like to know why not adopt two.\nMR. LUTHEY: I'd like, Your Honor, to offer a\nthird explanation in response to your direct question. If\nyou look at H.R. 1920, section 4, which was the first\nversion of IGRA that was -- that was put forward -- and\nthis is contained in our opening brief at pages 29 and 30\n-- you will see that the initial draft, after -- after\nmentioning provisions of the Internal Revenue Code,\nidentified two specific areas concerning the taxation and\nthe reporting and withholding of taxes. Two areas.\nThere was a committee report from the House that\nis set forth in our brief at page 30 that commented on\nthat text, and it noted that related provisions of the\nInternal Revenue Code, such as section 3402(q) and chapter\n35, then it said concerning taxation. So, it appears that\nyou could conclude that the initial phrase, concerning\ntaxation, referenced chapter 35.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. LUTHEY: That Congress ended. A new\nCongress began. Senate bill 555 was introduced with\nlargely the same language and presumably with Congress\nbeing informed by the prior committee report.\nThen there was testimony before the Senate\ncommittee on IGRA in 1987, and tribal interests at those\nhearings specifically objected to the phrase, concerning\ntaxation, rightly or wrongly -- rightly or wrongly --\nbecause they were concerned that it would give the\nimpression that this was somehow providing for taxation by\nthe Federal Government of tribal gaming. We -- we know\nthat in the legislative history.\nThe next thing that happened is the text was\nchanged. Concerning taxation was deleted, and the synonym\nfor concerning taxation contained in House of\nRepresentatives Report No. 99488 that accompanied the\nprior bill -- the synonym for taxation, chapter 35, was\ninserted in the text.\nAnd when you see that legislative history, how\nthe synonym for concerning taxation was removed from the\nlegislative history committee report and brought to the\ntext, and then you see what the text consisted of, which\nis the parenthetical that contains five references, two --\ntwo of which have nothing to do with the reporting and\nwithholding.\nQUESTION: But, counsel --\nQUESTION: I get the third explanation, but the\nthird explanation then depends on the testimony of the\nIndian tribal interests that say they don't want the word\ntaxation. Where is the reference to that? How do I find\n-- I don't notice it in your brief, but I haven't read it\nthat --\nMR. LUTHEY: You will -- you will find that in\nthe amicus brief filed by Little Six at page 25.\nQUESTION: Counsel, it seems to me you have two\ndifferent kinds of presumptions that we face with language\nthat can be said to be ambiguous. One is that you don't\npresume exemptions from taxation from ambiguous language.\nOn the contrary, we have said that there are presumptions\nthat favor Indian tribes when there's an ambiguity. And\nit seems to me these presumptions are maybe a little bit\nin tension with each other, and which one should we rely\non here, do you think?\nAnd is there anything -- in the Mescalero Apache\ncase, which this Court decided, we did refuse to read an\nexemption into vague statutory language for tax purposes.\nHow do you distinguish the principles we applied in\nMescalero?\nMR. LUTHEY: In Mescalero, Your Honor, there\nwere actually two particular taxes at issue. One was a\ngross receipts tax on off-reservation ski resort receipts,\nand in that the Court went through the various statutes\nthat were being cited for the purpose of an exemption --\nthe New Mexico Enabling Act, the Indian Reorganization Act\n-- and found no ambiguity. So, there was no need to\nprovide application of the Indian law canon. Specifically\nthe Court said on the face of 465 there is no reason to\nhold that it forbids income taxes. No ambiguity.\nThen there was a second part that this Court\ndecided in part 2(b), and that's whether or not section\n465 of title 25's lands tax exemption extends to a use\ntax. And in that course -- in that case, the Court\nconstrued the statute, actually used the word construed.\nQUESTION: There's a well recognized\npresumption, Mr. Luthey. Where the -- you're talking\nabout a treaty negotiated between the Indians and the\nUnited States, ambiguities are read to favor the Indians.\nBut what is the reason for carrying that presumption over\ninto a statute?\nMR. LUTHEY: The underlying trust relationship,\nYour Honor, between the United States and the Indians, its\nwards, as recognized by this Court in the County of Oneida\ndecision.\nQUESTION: Well, but give me a better reason\nthan that. I mean, the underlying presumption between the\nUnited States and its wards. Why should that affect the\nconstruction of a statute?\nMR. LUTHEY: Because the statute is imposed by\nCongress on its wards, and this Court has long recognized,\nincluding in the Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, that statutes\nconcerning Indians that have ambiguity are to be construed\nin favor of the Indians. And the underlying strong,\npowerful policy underpinning is that trust relationship.\nQUESTION: Mr. Luthey -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.\nQUESTION: No.\nQUESTION: No, no. You had -- you had your\nfinger on your button before I did.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nWhat -- what do you say in response to your\nfriend's argument on the other side that the presumption\nin favor of the Indians should not apply because we're\ndealing here with a -- a taxing statute over which -- over\nIndian activities as to which the Government has plenary\npower under the Indian Commerce Clause. What's your\nresponse to that?\nThey -- I mean, they're contrasting the States.\nThey say, look, the States tax by -- by sufferance when\nthey -- when they tax tribes. The National Government\nhas -- has plenary authority, and therefore there should\nbe different rules. And the presumption shouldn't --\npresumption favorable to the Indians shouldn't operate.\nWhat's your response to that?\nMR. LUTHEY: I direct Your Honor to Squire v.\nCapoeman at 351 U.S. 1 where this Court dealt with a\nFederal tax, a claimed exemption from Federal taxation,\nand applied the Indian canon in favor of the tax exemption\nsought by the Indians.\nQUESTION: Mr. Luthey --\nQUESTION: Mr. Luthey, could I ask you? You say\nthey're just making the Indian tribes similar to the\nStates. I know there are State lotteries, but are there\n-- are there any State-run casinos in which, you know, you\nhave State employees who are croupiers saying, you know,\nMonsieur et madame, mettez bon jour? You know.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: A State GS-7 or something.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Are -- are there such entities?\nMR. LUTHEY: I'm not aware of any at this time,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: So -- so the plausibility of -- of\ngiving an exemption from tax here to the -- to the Indian\ncasinos, because after all the States have it, is really\nnot all that plausible because I don't know any State that\nhas gone into the casino business, nor do I think any is\nabout to.\nMR. LUTHEY: With respect, Your Honor, I must\ndisagree with you. The underlying policy for State\ngovernmental gaming and gaming under IGRA is exactly the\nsame. It is gaming to raise money to take care of\ngovernmental purposes. And in fact, under IGRA, that's\nwhat the money must be spent on.\nQUESTION: Do some --\nQUESTION: Mr. Luthey, may I ask you one\nquestion on -- on the text that supports Justice Breyer's\nnotion that maybe this was just a crazy drafter? The\nsection starts out, the provisions of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986. I take it that means all the provisions of\nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986. And including -- well,\nthat seems to be redundant, because you already have the\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code, all the\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and naturally\nthey would include these and everything else in the code.\nMR. LUTHEY: I -- I would suggest to Your Honor\nthat the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986\nare then explained after the parenthetical by specifically\nwhat the provisions concern that are to be applied in the\nsame way as States, and specifically included in that is\nchapter 35 which contains the exemption for States. And\nin fact --\nQUESTION: Well, wouldn't you expect the\nsentence then to start sections so and so and so and so\nconcerning? Why have the provisions of the Internal\nRevenue Code?\nMR. LUTHEY: The -- the lead-in, the provisions\nof the Internal Revenue Code, is limited by its -- by the\npart of the statute that identifies what the internal\nrevenue concerns that shall be applicable equally for\nState gaming, as well as for the tribal activity here.\nThe parenthetical is illustrative.\nMr. Chief Justice, with that, I'd like to\nreserve.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Luthey.\nMr. DuMont, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD C. DuMONT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nMR. DuMONT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nQUESTION: You must be excited about defending\nthis statute.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DuMONT: I'm always excited to appear before\nyou, Your Honor.\nThere are three statutory provisions really that\nare relevant here or sets of provisions, and if I can just\ngo through them very briefly.\nChapter 35, that we've talked about, imposes a\nFederal wagering excise tax on certain limited kinds of\nwagering, including lotteries. It exempts State\nlotteries, but not tribal lotteries by its terms, from the\ntax.\nThe second is section 7871 --\nQUESTION: It makes no reference to Indian\nwagering operations in chapter 35? Just States?\nMR. DuMONT: Chapter 35 makes no --\nQUESTION: It exempts the States, makes no\nreference to the tribes.\nMR. DuMONT: Makes no reference, and it does\nnot, I should point out, exempt States from all taxes.\nIt's a fairly limited exemption for State lotteries. So,\nif a State were to enter the gaming business, then parts\nof the wagering excise tax would apply to the State. But\nthere's an exemption for State lotteries and not for\ntribal lotteries.\nQUESTION: Just -- not just lotteries. There\nwould be an exemption for State casinos, I assume, if the\nState should open a casino.\nMR. DuMONT: I think actually that the exemption\nis more limited than that. It's an exemption for State\nlotteries.\nQUESTION: In chapter 35?\nQUESTION: Is that in the papers before us?\nQUESTION: Then why do we have a problem here?\nAren't we talking about casinos here?\nMR. DuMONT: If you look at page --\nQUESTION: If the exemption only applies to\nlotteries, gee, we don't have a problem.\nMR. DuMONT: It's page 92a of the petition\nappendix, reprints section 4402 which lists the\nexemptions. There's one for parimutuels. There's one for\nslot machines, and then there's the third one for State-\nconducted lotteries. It's on any wager placed in a\nsweepstakes wagering pool or lottery conducted by an\nagency of a State acting under authority of State law.\nQUESTION: And is that what they're relying on\nin this case, that -- that exemption as exempting casinos?\nMR. DuMONT: That's the exemption, although the\n-- the gambling at issue here is so-called pull-tabs which\nare a form of lottery, not a form of table gaming. So, I\nthink it's true that pull-tabs are -- are considered a\nlottery for purposes of this tax.\nQUESTION: What is a pull-tab? I've never\npulled --\nMR. DuMONT: A pull-tab is a little card about\nlike this with three to five little windows, like an\nAdvent calendar, that you can pull up and reveal something\nunderneath them.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: What a weird analogy.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DuMONT: And if you find under it three\nangels, for instance, you may --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DuMONT: -- you may win something. So, you\npay a dollar for the ticket. If you get the right\ncombinations of symbols under the tickets, then you win\nsomething. If you don't, you don't.\nQUESTION: Of course, in Calvinist theology,\nit's not weird at all.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: So, in any event, we're not taking\nhere about Indian casinos, gambling casino operations,\nbecause they wouldn't be covered by the exemption in title\n35 even if it applied.\nMR. DuMONT: That's correct. They would not be\ncovered by the exemption. They would be covered by the\ntax.\nQUESTION: Well, that depends on how broadly one\nconstrues the word lottery, and that's been broadly\nconstrued in some cases.\nMR. DuMONT: That's true. There's a fairly\nspecific --\nQUESTION: But in any event, in this case we do\nhave an Indian lottery.\nMR. DuMONT: We have an Indian lottery. We --\nwe are prepared to concede that, yes.\nQUESTION: Well, is -- are we talking about --\nis the excise tax, .25 percent on the amount of each wager\nin 4401(a)(1) -- does that apply to Indian gaming? It\nsays, there shall be imposed on any wager authorized under\nthe law of the State in which accepted excise tax equal to\n0.25 percent of the amount of such wager. Is that the\nkind we're talking about here?\nMR. DuMONT: That's the tax. It's the .25\npercent on any wager.\nQUESTION: That is the tax we're talking about.\nMR. DuMONT: That is the tax we're talking\nabout. Now, wager -- the definitions exclude most kinds\nof table games like blackjack and so on where, if you look\nat the definitions, which are on page 90 --\nQUESTION: See, that's -- what I'm thinking of\n-- what I'm thinking about is since 44(a) -- 4401(a)(1);\ni.e., there shall be a quarter of 1 percent tax on every\nwager authorized under the law of the State, except later\non, A, B, C, D. If that's what we're talking about in\nthis case, I'm trying to understand the testimony to which\nthey pointed by Mr. Lionell John who said, I object to\nthat word taxation because it would impose -- give\nauthority to impose a tax on Indian tribes. But there\nalready was that authority in 4401(a). Is that right?\nMR. DuMONT: That's -- that's certainly correct.\nThis tax applies, by its terms, to anyone who accepts a\nwager and we would certainly say that includes a State or\na tribe. Now, States are specifically exempted under\nchapter 35; tribes are not.\nNow, let me use that to point out that an\nexplanation, a good explanation, for the presence of\nsection 2719(d) in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act is the\nexquisite sensitivity to tax issues in all these matters\nrelating to Indian gaming. And what 2719(d) does is to\nmake clear that a State -- a tribal lottery operation,\nlike the State lottery operation, would in fact have to\ncomply with the withholding and reporting requirements of\nthe Internal Revenue Code.\nQUESTION: I can understand --\nMR. DuMONT: Now, that would not be a foregone\nconclusion to many tribal lawyers.\nQUESTION: I can understand that. What I can't\nunderstand is the reference to chapter 35. You don't\nreally have a good explanation for that, do you? What --\nwhat does the -- what does the reference to chapter 35\ncover that's of any relevance?\nMR. DuMONT: We do not have a good explanation\nfor that.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nQUESTION: That was -- you subscribe to the\nposition that Judge Dyke took in the Federal circuit\nbecause he said there wasn't a good explanation for it\neither.\nMR. DuMONT: That's right. We have suggested --\nthe Tenth Circuit suggested possibly incorporating the\ndefinitions of lottery and wager from chapter 35. That's\nnot a strong explanation.\nQUESTION: How about the reference to section\n6050I? Do you have an explanation for that?\nMR. DuMONT: It's a lot more understandable for\nthe following reason. What 6050I relates to is anyone\noperating a business who receives $10,000 or more in cash\nfrom anyone in a business transaction or a series of\ntransactions, and that is required to be reported. It's a\nregulatory measure.\nNow, one can certainly understand why that does\nand should apply to these operations like other business\noperations. And it's in the same family as tax reporting\nobligations, but there's certainly attention in the\nlanguage with respect to that one as well.\nNow, there are several things to point about --\nout about all this. One is that we don't know what\nhappened in the committee that revised the statute, but\nwhat we do know is that the statute went in to that\ncommittee in a way that clearly would have referred to all\ntaxation, provisions of the Internal Revenue Code covering\nall taxation of wagering operations, and that would have\nimported chapter 35 and also the State exemption.\nIt came out in a very different form. It came\nout not only with the word taxation deleted, the\nparenthetical added, but also with the language about\nwinnings added, and that is why it's not, in fact,\npossible to say that chapter 35 was just a substitution\nfor the deletion of the word taxation because it's not all\nthey did. They also added the limitation that it applies\nto winnings from gaming or wagering operations. And\nthat's completely inconsistent with the application of\nchapter 35.\nQUESTION: Is there someone over in the IRS\nwhose job it is to look through bills, when they finally\nemerge, and check the cross references and the numbers who\nmight have caught what seems to be, in your argument\ncertainly, an accidental error in not taking a number out\nthat should have been taken out? Is there anyone there\nwhose job it is to do that? I would think there was.\nMR. DuMONT: There are a lot of people both at\nthe IRS and on the Hill whose job it is to comb through\ntax legislation.\nI would point out that this legislation came\nthrough the Indian Affairs Committee. It was drafted by\npeople who are not expert Internal Revenue Code drafters,\nand it bears a resemblance, but only a resemblance, to the\nkind of precision that one sees in tax legislation and in\nthe provisions of the Internal Revenue Code itself.\nQUESTION: After the split, though, between the\nTenth Circuit and the Federal circuit, did anyone call the\nresponsible committee's attention to this so that Congress\ncould fix up the statute?\nMR. DuMONT: I'm not aware that anyone has\nbrought this issue to -- onto the legislative agenda. I\ndon't know that.\nThe other thing I would point out about the\nlanguage is that when they -- when the committee\nreformulated this language to include the parenthetical,\nthe kind of parenthetical it is I think is important.\nIt's an example. It's exemplary parenthetical. We're not\nin the habit of ignoring parenthetical qualifications in\nstatutes, particularly not in the Internal Revenue Code.\nBut this is a special kind of parenthetical. It's one\nthat says provisions of the Internal Revenue Code\nconcerning the reporting and withholding of taxes, and\nthen it has what is intended to be a helpful list of\nexamples, including 1441, 3402(q), and so on.\nNow, I just think it's interesting to remember\nthat if all of those examples were perfectly apt, then one\ncould properly characterize the entire parenthetical as\nsuperfluous. So, what's interesting here is that although\nit's true that our interpretation will give no effect to\nthe reference to chapter 35, what my colleague's\ninterpretation would do is to give particular and\nsurprising effect to one anomalous cross reference in --\nQUESTION: Well, it isn't surprising in the\nbroad sense that Congress clearly has favored Indian\ngaming operations and has wanted to provide income to the\ntribes for their purposes through those operations, and to\nimpose an excise tax on it when the Congress doesn't\nimpose it on the States would be perfectly consistent with\nthat overall objective, it seems to me.\nMR. DuMONT: I think it would have been\nperfectly consistent to grant the exemption. I think it's\nperfectly consistent not to grant the exemption. And\ntherefore, I think the policy argument is sort of --\nQUESTION: Maybe not as consistent because the\neffort over there in Congress has been to support these\nIndian gaming operations, not that I necessarily think\nit's a good idea, but Congress obviously does. So, that\nmay well have been their overall objective.\nMR. DuMONT: Well, but recall, Justice O'Connor,\nthat in the specific context of the Indian Gaming\nRegulatory Act, what was going on was not a unilateral\nproject in favor of tribal interests. It was a very much\na long-term and hard-fought compromise between State\ninterests and tribal interests.\nQUESTION: But the State interest is not -- I\nmean, you're -- you're saying that part of the compromise\nmight be that the States end up without taxation and the\nIndians get taxed. I -- I could understand that if we\nwere concerned about sort of allowing a disparity between\nthe States and tribes and the ultimate tax effect to them.\nBut I would have thought that the competition\nbetween the States and the tribes would have been a\ncompetition for gamblers, for money coming in. And this\ntaxation of the States at the other end wouldn't seem to\naffect that at all. If somebody is going to wager a\ndollar, he doesn't care whether -- whether the casino has\nto pay a tax on his dollar or whether -- whether it\ndoesn't. He's just interested in the payout. And -- and\nso I'm -- I don't quite see why it is plausible that\ntaxing the Indians but not taxing the States might have\nbeen part of a -- a compromise in the competition between\nStates and Indians for -- for gambling business.\nMR. DuMONT: I think your competitive analogy is\nexactly right. Or that's the right lens through which to\nview this statute. But I think it also points up that\nit's a mistake to get wrapped up in the details of this\ncase and to think about section 2719(d) as a provision\nthat was -- was directed specifically at State wagering\ntaxes.\nWhat it was directed at, I submit, is making\nsure that from the point of view of the gambler, there\nwould be no difference -- the tax point of view of the\ngambler, there would be no difference in going to a State\nlottery or a tribal lottery or a State game or a tribal\ngame. And that's why what it says is provisions relating\nto the reporting and withholding of taxes on winnings, on\nthe gambler's winnings, are to be observed by the tribe in\nthe same way that they would be observed by the State.\nAnd the only thing that has gotten us -- and\nthat's a perfectly clear set of rules and there's a\nperfectly good reason for it. The only thing that gets us\nmixed up in this case is the fact that there is what would\nappear to be a leftover or inadvertent reference to\nchapter 35.\nQUESTION: Yes. Is there something -- is there\nsomething else?\nMay I go to --\nQUESTION: Well, no. Before you depart from\nthat subject, I -- I assume that there would be a -- a\nmotive for the States to want to have these taxes imposed\non the Indian lotteries even though they are not imposed\non the State lotteries. Just sheer competitive reasons.\nTrue, it doesn't affect the gambler immediately, but that\nlottery which does not have to pay the tax can give much\nbetter odds and gamblers tend to bet with a lottery that\ngives the better odds. So, this -- this does place the\nState lotteries at a considerable advantage over the\nIndian lotteries, if you read it the way you want.\nMR. DuMONT: It's a very small tax, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: It's a small tax.\nMR. DuMONT: If it were a bigger tax --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: The odds are pretty -- pretty close,\nI mean.\nQUESTION: May I now ask you to turn to -- to\nsomething else? I asked counsel on the other side about\nthe significance of your argument that the presumption\nfavoring the -- the tribes in this situation should not\noperate, even though it might in a case of State taxation,\nbecause of the Government's plenary power over Indians as\n-- as distinct from the States' right only by sufferance\nof the Federal Government to tax. Why should that make a\ndifference?\nMR. DuMONT: I think because of the historical\ndifference in the relations between the Federal Government\nand the tribes on the one hand and the State governments\nand the tribes on the other hand, and the best case I can\npoint you to on that is the Kagama case from the end of\nthe last century which talks about the trust relationship\nand it talks about the fact that the tribes stand in a\nvery different relation to the Federal Government from the\nrelation in which they stand to the States.\nQUESTION: Well, that -- that certainly affects\n-- we'll assume the obligation of the Government, and it\ncertainly may well accept the -- the specific decisions\nthat the Government makes. But when we don't know what\ndecision the Government has made, when the statute is\nambiguous, why should the existence of the trust\nrelationship, in effect, be to the tribes' disadvantage in\nconstruing the ambiguous statute?\nMR. DuMONT: There are two things that I'd like\nto --\nQUESTION: It seems counterintuitive, I guess.\nMR. DuMONT: Well, there are two things I'd like\nto point out about that.\nThe first is that, of course, if we get down to\na battle of canons here, that we find the statute\nhopelessly ambiguous and it must be interpreted with\nreference to general principles, then the principle -- the\nIndian canon certainly has some reference, but so does the\ngeneral canon of strictly construing Federal revenue\nstatutes. And that's, of course, a context in which the\nGovernment has a trust relationship with all the people,\nthat we must apply revenue statutes in a way that --\nQUESTION: What does the trust relationship tell\nus that informs us in -- in construction? It tells us\nsomething about the Government's obligations to various\ngroups of people, but I don't know what it tells us about\n-- about meaning.\nMR. DuMONT: I'm not sure it tells you very much\nat all about meaning. In a case where you have -- where\nyou're using the canon as a true tie-breaker, then it may\nbe a salutary principle of construction for all the same\nreasons --\nQUESTION: That's what I'm assuming. That's\nwhat I'm assuming. I'm assuming there are two tie-\nbreakers and they're at odds.\nMR. DuMONT: -- for all the same reasons that\nthe trust relationship exists in the first place --\nQUESTION: Yes, but you say they're -- they're\nnot -- or the -- the apparent loggerhead should -- should\ndissolve when you realize that the Government has a\nparticular trust relationship to Indians. And my\nsuggestion is, if that's the case, why isn't it more\nlikely that the canon favoring the Indians would prevail?\nMR. DuMONT: I don't suggest that in -- in cases\ninvolving Federal taxation because there is an equally\nstrong and -- and, in this particular context, opposite\nprinciple that exemptions from the exactions, the general\nexactions, to support the Federal Government are to be\nnarrowly construed.\nQUESTION: Mr. -- Mr. --\nMR. DuMONT: And more to the point, they're not\nto be inferred.\nQUESTION: Mr. DuMont, supposing we didn't have\nhere an Indian tribe but an individual Indian who was\nclaiming an exemption from taxation. Would the same\nprinciple of resolving ambiguities in favor of Indians\napply to that case?\nMR. DuMONT: Not in the same -- not in the same\nway. And the cases, of course, on that in the tax area\nare very clear, The Cherokee Tobacco case and the other\ncases that say that a general taxing statute, general\nFederal taxing statute is to be applied in accordance with\nits terms absent some specific treaty or statutory right.\nNow, in interpreting an ambiguous treaty or statutory\nright, there may be -- there may be room for applying that\ncanon.\nBut I'd like to come back, if I could, to the\nother reason --\nQUESTION: Mr. Dumont, before we get off of\ncanons, we've just been talking about two, but there's a\nthird one. Indians really have two canons on their side\nand the third one is, to my mind, the strongest and -- and\nthe one that's -- that's the hardest for you to overcome.\nAnd that is that you never read a statute so that any of\nits provisions is inoperative or senseless. And --\nMR. DuMONT: I agree with you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: To be sure, the Indians' proposed\ninterpretation here is strained, but you can do it;\nwhereas there is no possible way to read section 35 on\nyour interpretation as being relevant. What do you say to\nthat? I really think you have the burden of showing that\n-- that the Indians' interpretation is not only strained,\nbut it's really so strained, it's just -- it's just an\nimpossible interpretation. Why is it an impossible\ninterpretation using, you know, that A, B, using the or to\nmean -- you know.\nMR. DuMONT: Right. First of all, I agree with\nyou that that's our biggest issue in this case.\nSecond, I also agree that our answer to that is\nthat the statute is not ambiguous, and this gets back to\nthe canon point. The statute is not ambiguous because it\ncannot be fairly read to -- to impose the exemption that\nmy colleagues want. And I would say that not only because\nit's not the natural reading, as you pointed out, Justice\nScalia, of the statute, but also because you put several\nthings together.\nFirst of all, I'm looking at page --\nQUESTION: 90a of the --\nMR. DuMONT: 90a.\nQUESTION: -- of the appendix to the petition.\nMR. DuMONT: But -- page 90a.\nThe -- at the end of the -- what they want to do\nis to split gaming -- winnings from gaming or wagering\noperations. Now, first of all, the very last line of the\nstatute refers to State gaming and wagering operations,\nand there it is used as a phrase. And we submit that\nthat's powerful evidence that it's used as a phrase a few\nlines up.\nSecond, in the very next breath from where it\nsays, with respect to the winnings from gaming or wagering\noperations, the statute says, shall apply to Indian gaming\noperations. It doesn't -- doesn't say, apply to Indian\ngaming. It says, apply to Indian gaming operations.\nAgain, clearly the statute is using those two together.\nThird, even if we were to accept that\ninterpretation, I'm not sure where it would get the tribes\nhere because if you accept that interpretation, then you\nare divorcing winnings and gaming -- or sorry -- wagering\nand gaming. It means they don't mean the same thing. And\nall the statute confers is a right to have these\nprovisions apply to Indian gaming operations conducted\npursuant to this chapter in the same manner as it applies\nto the States.\nNow, if we're going to divorce gaming from\nwagering operations, then having the provisions that apply\nto gaming by the States tells you nothing about chapter 35\nbecause chapter 35 applies to wagering operations.\nSo -- and -- and finally, I think, as Justice\nGinsburg and some of the other colloquies pointed out\nearlier, the implication of that reading would be that the\nreporting and withholding requirements that we all agree\nare central to this statute somehow only apply to the\nIndian gaming piece and they don't apply to the wagering\noperations piece. And that makes no sense out of the\nstatute.\nQUESTION: But --\nMR. DuMONT: So, for all those reasons, I don't\nthink it's just a strained reading; I think it's an\nimpossible reading of the statute.\nQUESTION: But you do concede that, as I believe\nJudge Dyke said, the only way to make sense out of the\nstatute is to treat it as though the reference to chapter\n35 were not there.\nMR. DuMONT: I think that's right. I think in\n-- in effect what one has to do is ignore the\nparenthetical, the examples in the parenthetical, and give\neffect instead to the -- what we would call the operative\nstatutory text. And as I said, if you took out the entire\nparenthetical, it wouldn't change anything about the --\nthe effect of this statute on sections 1441, 3402(q), or\n6041 because those are provisions of the Internal Revenue\nCode concerning the reporting and withholding of taxes\nwith respect to winnings, and so they would continue to\napply even if we deleted the entire parenthetical.\nWhat wouldn't continue to apply are these two\ninapt examples -- or the one inapt example of chapter 35\nand possibly 6050I. And in a particular situation like\nthis, I take no joy in saying that there are some words\nthat have no effect in the statute, but that is the\nposition we're left with, and it is by far the better\nposition of the two that are possible.\nQUESTION: Maybe I can just ask you one\nclarifying question. Does this -- does this statute apply\nto casino gambling generally or does it not?\nMR. DuMONT: I'm sorry. Which statute?\nQUESTION: Well, the one we're talking about in\nthe case. The whole -- this whole tax --\nMR. DuMONT: The Gaming Regulatory Act or the --\nor the wagering tax?\nQUESTION: The wagering tax.\nMR. DuMONT: The wagering tax -- the definitions\n-- the definitions on page 97a exempt from -- they define\na wager as sports wagering or 4421(1)(c), any wager placed\nin a lottery conducted for profit. And the definition of\nlottery excludes games that are typically played where the\nwagers are placed, the winners are determined, and the\ndistribution of prizes are made in the presence of all\npersons. And that excludes both bingo, which is, of\ncourse, a principal tribal gaming activity, and also most\ntable games like roulette or blackjack.\nQUESTION: It does exclude them.\nMR. DuMONT: It excludes those.\nI'd like to point out one thing I haven't\nmentioned yet which is there's an entire section of the\nInternal Revenue Code -- and it's reprinted in the\nappendix to our brief -- section 7871, which deals very\nspecifically and in excruciating detail with tax\nexemptions that are or are not available to tribes under\nthe Internal Revenue Code. It was enacted by the Indian\nTribal Governmental Tax Status Act. In other words,\nCongress was specifically focusing on this issue. And if\nyou look at page 2a of the --\nQUESTION: Of what?\nMR. DuMONT: Of the main gray brief, the gray\nbrief on the merits.\nThat reprints section 7871 starting on page 1a,\nand at the very bottom of 1a, it says, subject -- sorry.\nStarting up there at the top, 7871, a general rule, an\nIndian tribal government shall be treated as a State. And\nthen there's series of things.\nIf you go down to the bottom of 1a, subject to\nsubsection (b), for purposes of any exemption from,\ncredit, or refund or payment with respect to an excise tax\nimposed by chapter 31, chapter 32, chapter 33, chapter 36\nof the Internal Revenue Code, but not chapter 35.\nAnd so, that we think is very strong evidence\nboth that Congress has thought through this problem\ncarefully, and when it did, it chose not to extend the\nwagering tax exemption to tribes.\nAnd number two, when IGRA came along a few years\nlater, there would have been a very easy -- there would\nhave been two very easy and clear ways for Congress to\nextend the exemption that the tribes are now claiming.\nNumber one, amend section 7871 to add chapter 35 in this\nlist. Number two, go to chapter 35 and where the State\nlottery exemption is extended, say or a State -- or a\ntribe. Congress didn't adopt either of those measures,\nand we think the ease of doing that counsels very strongly\nagainst --\nQUESTION: That would have had to come up\nthrough the Ways and Means Committee if they had done\nthat?\nMR. DuMONT: I suspect it would have had to go\nthrough the tax writing committee certainly, yes.\nIt counsels very strongly against interpreting\ndifficult language in a collateral section of an entirely\ndifferent non-tax statute to extend a tax exemption that\nCongress has not clearly granted.\nIf there are no further questions.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. DuMont.\nMr. Luthey, you have 1 minute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GRAYDON D. LUTHEY, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. LUTHEY: Thank you, Your Honor.\nWith respect to 7871 that my colleague has\nmentioned, that article -- that argument is impeached by\n2719(d)(2) of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act which says\nthat the provisions of this subsection, which includes the\nstatute we've been talking about today, shall apply\nnotwithstanding any other provision of law enacted before,\non, or after October 17th, 1988. So, that particular\nsection provides the preeminence.\nAt the end of the day, I think we know this.\nThe language in question that we've been wrestling with\nhere today is ambiguous. They call it cryptic. That's a\nsynonym for ambiguous, as the dictionary tells us.\nSecondly, the Government's construction requires\na reading out. Our construction gives effect to every\nword of the statute and is possible. If possible, under\nthe test of this Court in County of Yakima, the Indian\ncanons must be applied to resolve the ambiguity in our\nfavor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Luthey.\n"
