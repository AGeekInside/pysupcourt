        "content": "(11:16 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext this morning in Case Number 08-810, Conkright v.\nFrommert.\nMr. Long.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. LONG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn this ERISA case, the court of appeals\napplied a deferential standard of review to the\ndistrict court's interpretation of the Xerox plan, but\nnot to the plan administrator's interpretation. We\nthink the court of appeals got it backwards.\nUnder either a deferential standard of\nreview or a de novo standard, the plan administrator's\ninterpretation should prevail. That interpretation,\nunlike the district court's interpretation, is\ngrounded in the language of the plan. It recognizes\nthe fundamental actuarial principle of the time value\nof money, and it avoids conferring windfalls.\nIn Firestone and Glenn, this Court looked to\nthe language of the plan, which reflects the intent of\nthe plan's sponsor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. But -- but when the\nadministrator has interpreted the plan incorrectly and\nthe court finds -- the court of appeals finds that he\nhas interpreted it incorrectly, it doesn't have to\nsend it back and say, you know: Give me another bid;\ntry something else. It says: You did it incorrectly,\nand we find that what you should have done is this.\nIsn't that what normally happens?\nMR. LONG: Well, we think under trust law,\nwhich the Court has looked to in Glenn and Firestone,\nwhere the plan of the settlor of the trust has\nassigned the responsibility for making the\ndiscretionary determinations to the plan administrator\nor to the trustee, unless there's been a showing of\nbad faith or some other reason to think that the\ndiscretion will not be exercised honestly and fairly,\nit -- it is really up to the plan administrator to\nmake that discretionary determination.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So all a court can do in\nthose trust cases is to say: You've got it wrong,\nSam; go back and do it again. Right?\nMR. LONG: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And he gets it wrong again,\nand he goes back to court; the court says: Sam, it's\nstill wrong; go back and do it again.\nMR. LONG: Well, we --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I can't believe that that's\nwhat the law is.\nMR. LONG: We think these situations of\nthe -- of the multiple bites at the apple will be\nrare. Trust law has had this rule for decades, and\nthat has not been a problem --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the SG says that\nisn't trust law. The SG says that trust law -- when\nyou make a mistake and you send it back, that the\ndistrict judge has a choice here, which would make\nsense. The district judge, if he thinks he's going to\nget something out of the trust -- the administrator,\nlistens to him.\nI mean, it sounds like common sense would\nbe: Listen to the administrator, but you don't have\nto do it.\nMR. LONG: Well, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because it's very\ncomplicated. He may understand it.\nMR. LONG: I'd -- I'd have a two-part\nanswer, Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, is she wrong? You're\nsaying if I look at those cases, I'll find --\nMR. LONG: Well, I think, first, it would\nbe -- it would be quite unusual to say the standard of\nreview is up to the court, that it can be either --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not -- it's not a\nstandard of review. It's -- he's trying to figure out\nwhat the word \"duplicative\" means, okay? And the --\nand the administrator did his best. He says it means\nwhat it meant before, which is, like, 14 pages of\nwho-could-understand-it. Okay.\nMR. LONG: Well -- well, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then it turns out that\nthat isn't what it means, and the district judge says:\nThat's affirmed. So now he says: Give me another\nshot.\nIf it were me, I'd listen, but if I thought\nthis isn't really that great, I would try to figure\nout something else. And then if I were a court of\nappeals judge, I'd say it's up to the district court.\nMR. LONG: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, luckily, the SG says\nthat is the law.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LONG: Well, but Professor Scott, who\nwas the reporter for both the second and the first\nRestatement --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. LONG: -- and whose treatise correlates\nwith the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Says it isn't the law.\nMR. LONG: The section numbers correlate\nexactly with the sections of the Restatement for which\nhe was reporter. If you look in section 187 of his\ntreatise, which correlates with section 187 of the\nRestatement Second, the principle is that unless\nthere's been bad faith or some other reason to expect\nthat the trustee will not exercise the discretion\nfairly and honestly -- I mean, there -- and there are\nexamples, illustrations 11 and 12. If -- if the\namount is unreasonably low --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about just that? He\ncame back, the administrator, I think, the second\ntime, with something that very closely resembled the\nfirst time.\nMR. LONG: Well, I think it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what about that for a\nreason thinking he's not in that good of faith?\nGo ahead.\nMR. LONG: I think it's quite different,\nwith -- with respect, Justice Breyer. The -- the\nreconstructed account methodology really looked to the\nperformance of a hypothetical account, but the -- what\nwe call the plan administrator's interpretation, the\ninterpretation that came up for the first time after\nthe Second Circuit, overruling the district court,\nsaid, you know, this plan provision that clearly tells\nyou how to do it is actually invalid --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if there's no --\nMR. LONG: -- because it wasn't properly\ndisclosed.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If there's no bad faith,\nthen how many shots does the plan administrator -- who\nI don't think is named Sam -- gets to --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- to try to answer this\nquestion?\nMR. LONG: Well, we think the standard\nis that if -- as long as there is discretion to be\nexercised within the limits that would be set by the\ncourt's opinion, absent a showing of bad faith or\nother reason to think the discretion won't be\nexercised honestly and fairly, it ought to be left to\nthe plan administrator, because that's what the plan\nprovides.\nNow, I think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Long, we're talking\nin the abstract --\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- referring to Scott, but\n-- that this case -- what I took away from the Second\nCircuit's opinion was the flaw here was not that the\nmethod was no good if you had adequate notice; the\nflaw was the people affected were not told in what is\nthe language of ERISA, in plain, simple language, what\ntheir entitlement was. And that's -- that's the\nproblem, not that this method wasn't perfectly\nsatisfactory if you gave everybody notice. But the\nSecond Circuit said, you didn't give them notice.\nEither it said nothing or it was totally ambiguous.\nMR. LONG: Yes, and that's right at the\nheart of the case, and you are quite correct. The\nSecond Circuit did say there was not adequate notice\nof the reconstructed account methodology, but it's an\nimportant part of our submission that the plan\nadministrator's interpretation on remand is\nsignificantly different.\nThis is the way these offsets are typically\ndone. There's nothing hypothetical about it. You\ntake the lump sum that was actually paid to these plan\nparticipants. You look to the annuity that could have\nbeen purchased with that lump sum, using the annuity\nrates that are put out by the Federal government, by\nthe PBGC.\nThis is the typical way this offset is\nperformed. This is -- falls within the safe harbor,\nthe chief actuaries have filed an amicus brief saying\nthis is quite typical, so this --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if -- if there were\ninformation, but the -- the ERISA provision says that\nyou are supposed to give the summary description of\nthe plan \"in a manner calculated to be understood by\nthe average plan participant.\"\nMR. LONG: Yes, yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And all that the 1989\nstatement said was the amount the employees received\nmay be reduced, if they previously left the company\nand received a distribution at that time.\nMR. LONG: Yes. And the -- and the Second\nCircuit did not decide this question of whether the\nnotice of the plan administrator's interpretation was\nsufficient, and -- but we think there are very strong\narguments that it -- that it was.\nI mean, first of all, it did describe the\ncircumstances in which there could be an offset, which\nis what the statute and the regulation requires.\nAnd, second, it is the law in the Second\nCircuit, as elsewhere, that in a summary plan\ndescription -- which is just that, a summary -- you\nneed not describe in detail every offset and every\nactuarial adjustment. There are many such adjustments\nin ERISA plans. They frequently apply to relatively\nsmall numbers of participants.\nIf it were a requirement of the statute that\neach of these be described in detail in a summary plan\ndescription, you would risk defeating the purpose of\nthe summary plan description and invalidating many\nERISA plans across the country.\nSo we would urge the Court, strongly, not to\naccept this argument that, oh, well, you know, if\nthe -- if the notice of the reconstructed account\nmethodology is inadequate, then it must also be the\ncase that the notice of this different -- I would say\n\"plain vanilla\" kind of offset -- typical offset, must\nalso be inadequate. We don't think that is true --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why -- this is\nimportant to me, whether the plan administrator was\ninterpreting the same language when this case was\nremanded back down. Originally, he was simply\napplying the methodology that had been specified in\n1990, right?\nMR. LONG: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the court said that was\nno good because you didn't give these people notice of\nit. But that -- he had been applying that test not\nsince 1990, but since 1980. In other words, he had\ntaken that to be a reasonable interpretation of the\nvery summary language in -- in the plan itself, right?\nMR. LONG: That is absolutely correct, and\nat the time that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So when it went back, why\ndidn't he stick with that and say: Yes, they didn't\nhave adequate notice of that, but that is still a\nreasonable interpretation of the original plan, even\nbefore we specified that.\nMR. LONG: When it went back on remand from\nthe Second Circuit the first time, the plan\nadministrator adopted a -- a new interpretation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. LONG: That is what I'm calling the\n\"plain vanilla\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. Why did\nhe do that? Inasmuch as the first interpretation was\nnot adopted in 1990, but it was adopted under the same\nlanguage that he is now interpreting in 1980, right?\nHe was applying it between 1980 and 1990. That's what\nhe thought he -- that's what he thought the plan meant\nin all those years.\nMR. LONG: Well -- and there was a provision\nin the plan that specifically told him to do the\noffset in this way, and the Second Circuit --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: After 1990.\nMR. LONG: Well, no. It was also in the\nplan before 1990. It --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I didn't understand. I\ndidn't understand it.\nMR. LONG: Yes. A lot of this case started\nbecause it got dropped out of the 1989 restatement, by\naccident, for a period of 3 months, and all of these\ndire consequences are really flowing from that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, your -- your brief\nsays: \"The Plan Administrator has consistently\napplied the reconstructed account methodology since\nthe early '80s.\"\nMR. LONG: Yes, that's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Effective April '90\"\n-- \"1990, the Plan language requiring this methodology\nprovided as follows.\" So I took that to mean there\nwas no such language before that?\nMR. LONG: There -- there was. Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There was plan language\nrequiring it before 1990.\nMR. LONG: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. LONG: Yes, and that's another important\npoint in this complicated case. I mean, the only\nperiod in which this -- what we call the reconstructed\naccount methodology that gave specific instructions\nabout how to do it, so we say it was not at all\nunreasonable for the plan administrator to follow\nthose specific instructions.\nIt dropped out in this 1989 restatement for\na very short period and then got put back in. And\nthat's -- the Second Circuit said, well, then you get\ninto problems with anti-cutback and different types of\nthings, but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But where is it --\nwhat -- what was in the summary plan description on\nthis point between 1980 and 1990, where is that?\nMR. LONG: There were a variety of summary\nplan descriptions, obviously, and I think, in general,\nJustice Ginsburg, they simply had the statement that\nyour benefit may be reduced, if you have received a\nprior distribution.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Right. So there was no\ndescription of this in the summary plan description?\nMR. LONG: That's -- that is correct, during\nthat period, although, again --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So is it -- but what\nperiod? Between 1980 and 1990 or the 3-month period\n-\nMR. LONG: It was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you're talking about?\nMR. LONG: I think it was really in about\n1995. The descriptions got gradually more detailed,\nas we go into the 1990s, but through the '80s and up\ninto the -- I think until about 1995 or so, there\nwould have been simply a statement that your benefit\nmay be reduced --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. That's -- that's\nwhat I thought, and I thought you said no when I asked\nthat question, that this detailed description of the\nRAM didn't come in until 1990.\nMR. LONG: Oh -- well, I'm sorry if I\nmisunderstood you, Justice Scalia. I was talking\nabout the language of the plan, and we are, after all,\ntalking about benefits due under the terms of the\nplan. And the plan did include this specific\nreconstructed account methodology, except for the\n3-month period.\nNow, the summary plan description had a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh -- oh, I see.\nMR. LONG: -- had a much -- a much briefer\n-- but, again --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I got you.\nMR. LONG: An additional point on this,\nJustice Scalia, is -- I mean, this is a claim for\nbenefits due under the terms of the plan, and, you\nknow, there -- there's actually a circuit split on\nthis. But if the claim is something like, well, a\nsummary plan description wasn't good enough; it didn't\ncontradict the plan, and it told me the circumstances\nin which the benefits might be reduced, but it didn't\ntell me how -- and, that's just not good enough.\nOften, you have to make some sort of showing\nof reliance and prejudice, so it's really --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you seem to be\nrearguing the -- I thought that the -- I thought that\nyou had surrendered on -- what is it called? Frommert\nI. That -- that the Second Circuit said: What you\nhad was no good, because it violated the notice\nprovision and it violated the anti-cutback provision.\nSo that's what they call a phantom --\nMR. LONG: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- account. It's out.\nMR. LONG: They call it phantom accounting.\nRight.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's out. But you seem\nto now be telling us that was really a wrong decision\non the Second Circuit's part, that there was -- that\nit was perfectly good, that it was described in the\nplan itself, although not in the summary plan\ndescription.\nMR. LONG: Well -- well, no, and I -- I\nmean, what happened is for the plaintiffs in this\ncase, they were hired after the -- rehired after the\n1989 restatement went into effect, and so that's when\nthis -- when this provision that specifically\ndescribed the reconstructed account methodology was\ndropped out, and that's when all the trouble started.\nThe only reason I was mentioning the\nreconstructed account methodology was trying to\naddress Justice Scalia's question, although I may have\nconfused it further to say that the plan, the terms of\nthe plan, did include this specific provision, so it\nwas not crazy for the plan administrator to be\nfollowing that.\nNow, it was struck down by the Second\nCircuit, invalidated, and the plan administrator is\nnot seeking to challenge that on remand; obviously,\nthey can't. But coming up with a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you claim -- you claim\nthat what he is interpreting when it comes back to him\nis not the same text that they invalidated --\nMR. LONG: Absolutely. It's the remaining\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- but rather it's the plan\nwithout this text.\nMR. LONG: Absolutely. It's the remaining\nplan terms; there is a new interpretive question here,\nwhich is: How do we make sense of the remaining plan\nterms, now that the Second Circuit -- unlike the plan\nadministrator, unlike the district court -- has held\nthat this provision that specifically addresses this\nis invalid and can't be used. And that is really a\nnew interpretive question that came up in litigation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's -- it struck me if --\nit's hard. I don't necessarily follow it at all, but\nthe -- you had this original plan where, basically,\nyou were trying to figure out how much money they took\naway, and you compared it with what it would have made\nif you had invested it in certain funds. So now we\nhave a new word, which is called \"duplicative\"; you\ncan't be duplicative, something like that.\nAnd then the Second Circuit says that new\nword called \"duplicative\" for new plans doesn't really\npick up this old phantom system; at least, it doesn't\ngive notice.\nNow he sends it back, and the poor district\njudge, since he thought that was perfectly sensible to\nsay it did pick that up, says: Well, they told me it\ndidn't, so I'll ask the administrator what do you\nthink we do now? The administrator says: I have a\ngreat idea; the plain vanilla system. The plain\nvanilla system happens to be very much like the old\nsystem, except in following your own funds, you're not\ndoing it; you're following the -- the insurance\nindustry's funds.\nMR. LONG: Well, --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, I mean, that's -- it's\nwhat they'll pay for an annuity.\nMR. LONG: Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's called -- that's\ncalled their funds. That's called what they think\nthey'll earn.\nMR. LONG: Well, I mean, just a couple of\npoints in response, Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right.\nMR. LONG: I mean, first of all, it's not\njust the word \"duplication\" or \"non-duplication.\"\nSection 9.6, which is on page 32a of the Joint\nAppendix, says that if there has been a prior\ndistribution, the accrued benefit based on all the\nyears of participation --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right.\nMR. LONG: -- shall be offset by the accrued\nbenefit attributable to such distribution.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Correct, and the\nquestion is: What is attributable to? And they\nstruck down your phantom system for doing it, and then\nthe administrator comes back with a new system, which\nnew system is going to take the judgment of the\ninsurance companies about what was accrued.\nMR. LONG: Well, no, Your Honor, the\njudgment of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation\nwas what -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, fine.\nAnd then what he's thinking is that's\nawfully similar. We just substituted different people\nhere --\nMR. LONG: Well, but -- but, I mean, it's\nsimilar in a sense that I think is clearly favorable\nto the plan --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's similar in a sense,\nand it's different in a sense.\nMR. LONG: I mean, if I could -- this is a\nfloor-offset plan, and the basic concept of the floor\noffset plan is to give a kind of an insurance policy,\nthat if the defined contribution plan performs poorly,\nthe defined benefit component of the plan will\nguarantee that you get a certain minimum benefit. And\nso the way the thing works, if the defined\ncontribution balance is above the defined benefit,\nthen your defined contribution is your benefit. And\nthat's good. That means you have exceeded the floor.\nAnd what happened here is -- this whole\nthing -- we are calculating the defined benefit, the\nfloor. That's what we are doing, and we are trying to\nfigure out what sort of offset do you take into\naccount because these people got lump sums; in some\ncases quite, quite large. Mr. Frommert got almost\n$145,000 10 or 20 years ago.\nSo if -- the notion is, if Mr. Frommert had\ncontinued working for Xerox throughout his career,\nthis money would have continued to grow; it would have\nincreased his defined contribution benefit; and he\nwould have not needed to use his insurance policy.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the -- the more you\nhypothetically grow it, the less chance they'll get\nthe floor.\nMR. LONG: But -- and the key point --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so they'd like it to\nget the floor, and so they'd like it to be --\nMR. LONG: Well, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that right?\nMR. LONG: But the key point, if I -- yes.\nBut the key point is he had the use of this money for\nall these years.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true.\nMR. LONG: And -- and it is a fundamental\nprinciple of pensions, of ERISA, that there is a time\nvalue of money. And if you accept this interpretation\nthat the district court adopted, and then the court of\nappeals said: Well, we will just give it deferential\nreview; we won't even give it de novo review, it's --\nit's, you know, one reasonable interpretation among\nmany --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying it's -- and\nthese categories don't often help us. Is this a\nquestion of law? A mixed question of law and fact?\nMR. LONG: Well, I think, in terms of\nwhether this is a reasonable interpretation of the\nterms of the plan, it is a question of law. And I\nthink it is unreasonable -- I mean, certainly, looking\nat the plan language, there is plan language that does\nspeak to this, and then also, I mean, this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The court of appeals said\nit's just an application of equitable principles --\nMR. LONG: Well, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- not an interpretation of\nthe plan.\nMR. LONG: But it's a claim for benefits due\nunder the terms of the plan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, yes.\nMR. LONG: You know, I read you the\nlanguage. \"Accrued benefit\" is a defined term in the\nplan.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's the statutory\nterm? \"Benefits due under the terms of the plan\" is a\nstatutory term?\nMR. LONG: Yes. Yes. So, that -- that's\nwhat we're talking about. The Solicitor General\nagrees with us that if you're talking about the terms\nof the plan, even if you're trying to fashion a remedy\nfor a violation of ERISA, that is still a de novo\nreview question, and there would be terrible problems\nwith uniformity of plan interpretation if you said,\noh, well, you know, it's just a discretionary kind of\nreview; let's let every district court interpret this\nplan in its own fashion.\nBut -- but the notion of having --\nessentially, what the district court's interpretation\ndoes is to say we're going to have a zero interest\nrate, which is -- I mean, the chief actuary's brief\nsays they have never in their entire careers, none of\nthem, have ever seen an ERISA plan that does that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Up until this time?\nMR. LONG: Well, until the district court\nsaid it was a reasonable interpretation of this plan.\nAnd, in fact --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If this is not a\ndiscretionary decision for the district court -- let's\nassume it's not a discretionary decision for the --\nfor the administrator. But if it's -- and if it's\nalso not a discretionary decision for the district\ncourt, if what the district court is required to do is\nto say what the plan means, what would you suggest\nthat the district court should have looked to, when\nthe -- the provision, the -- the plan language that\nthe district court has to look at is very bare bones?\nMR. LONG: Well, but you -- absolutely you\nstart with the language, and we don't think it is\nquite that bare bones. The section 9.6, which says\nthe offset is the accrued benefit attributable to the\nprior distribution, and then section 1.1, which is the\ndefinition of \"accrued benefit,\" and that basically\nsays it is the normal retirement benefit payable at\nnormal retirement date at age 65 in an amount computed\nin accordance with section 4.3.\nAnd then 4.3 says the monthly benefit which\ncould be purchased with the member's transitional\nretirement account -- that's the defined contribution\naccount -- as calculated using -- using annuity rates\nestablished by the PBGC.\nSo it's not quite that bare-bones. But then\nwe would also say -- you would look to this notion\nthat the time value of money is an absolutely central\nconcept to pensions, and the notion of people would\nhave use of money for 10 years or 20 years at a\nzero interest rate -- and indeed, it's -- it's even\nworse than that because, I mean, ultimately this has\nto be expressed in the form of an annuity.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, Respondents say that\nthis was a -- sure, it's a -- a benefit to them to\nbe -- to have this offset only by the amount that they\nreceived and not take into account the time value of\nmoney, but this was an incentive that lured them into\naccepting employment again with Xerox.\nMR. LONG: Well, with -- with respect,\nJustice Alito, that is absolutely ridiculous. I mean,\nno employer would do that to their current employees.\nThat would treat the current employees like suckers.\nAnd it certainly didn't happen here. There's no\nevidence that that happened. I don't know of any case\nin which that has ever happened.\nI mean, you can give people a bonus --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does it -- how does\nit hurt the current employees?\nMR. LONG: Well, if you --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You say they -- they\ndon't get this --\nMR. LONG: If you said to the current\nemployees -- I mean, basically, Mr. Frommert, to take\nhim as an example, he's -- I mean, if someone who is\notherwise similarly situated to him had just kept\nworking for Xerox, they would not have needed the\ninsurance policy, either. Their defined contribution\naccount would have been above the floor, and so they\nwould get their defined contribution account.\nMr. Frommert had the use of all this money\nfor all these years. We don't know what he invested\nit in, but presumably it grew in the investments. But\nunder the district court's interpretation, he --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So some kind of equal\nprotection, that another worker will say: I didn't get\nthat boon that my --\nMR. LONG: Exactly. They'd say I've been\nworking --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's no -- no --\nnothing -- no deduction from the current workforce.\nThey're getting what the plan said all along is the\nright calculation of benefits.\nMR. LONG: Yes. And -- and that's what the\nplan administrator's interpretation is trying to\nachieve as closely as possible for the rehires. It's\ntrying to treat them the same.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: One -- well, I thought you\nsaid what this affects is just the floor; it doesn't\naffect the level of the -- of the defined\ncontribution.\nMR. LONG: Absolutely, Justice Scalia, the\ndefined contribution. Now, in this case, for Mr.\nFrommert, for example, was this large lump sum that he\ngot.\nI mean, another fact I'll mention is that\nXerox stopped making additional contributions to this\ndefined contribution account in 1990, just when\nMr. Frommert returned. That's -- that's where this $5\nthing comes from. His benefit, his defined\ncontribution benefit, was that large lump sum given\nmany years before a normal retirement date.\nI'd like to reserve the balance.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Long.\nMr. Stris.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. STRIS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nAfter hearing Mr. Long, I'd like to address\nmy remarks to two broad areas.\nFirst, I'd like to talk about why the lower\ncourts in this case were not required to defer the\nlegal principle. And then in light of some of the\nfactual claims he has made, which are belied by the\nrecord and directly contradict the findings of the\nlower court in this case, I'd like to explain why they\ndidn't defer.\nBecause sitting here, the irony to me is the\ncore focus of his position is that courts have\nepisodic involvement with these very complicated\nplans, and yet, as I'll get to in my second point,\nmost of his position is predicated on things that are\ndirectly contrary to the court in this case that was\non the ground that looked at these issues.\nHe wants this Court, which has even less of\nan -- a typical and constant involvement with the\nplan, to second-guess the lower court, but --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But even if the -- even if\nno deference was owed to the administrator, could you\nexplain why the task for the district court was not\nthen simply to interpret what the plan means?\nWhat puzzles me about -- something that\npuzzles me about the -- the two decisions by the\nSecond Circuit are (a) why this is remedial; why isn't\nit just a reinterpretation of the plan; (b) where\ntheir -- what do equitable principles have to do with\nthis; and why should it be a discretionary decision\nfor the district court? What does the plan mean?\nThat would be the issue. Isn't that the question, if\nthere's no deference due to the administrator?\nMR. STRIS: Yes. To me, that's the most\ndifficult question in this case. I'm -- I'm glad we\nare going straight to it. But then I'm going to go\nback to deference just to make sure we don't lose on\nthat point, where I think we are squarely right.\nNow to your question. Here's what happened:\nXerox made two arguments in the first round of\nlitigation. This is very important. Their first\nargument was that a later plan applied retroactively.\nThey didn't want to apply the '89 plan.\nTheir second argument -- and this is -- here\nare the best places where you can find it: Page 42a\nof the petition appendix -- that's the Second Circuit;\npage 75a and 85a of the petition appendix -- this is\nwhere the district court said it. Their second\nargument was that section 9.6 of the 1989 plan\npermitted an appreciated offset, something more than\njust a nominal offset. This was rejected as arbitrary\nand capricious.\nNow, the phantom account was rejected, but\nso was the broad principle that there could be an\nappreciated offset.\nNow, here's the answer to your question,\nJustice Alito: It would have been totally appropriate\nat that point in time for the Second Circuit to say\nthere's going to be a nominal offset. We would have\nbeen done. We wouldn't be here anymore.\nBut Xerox essentially made a fairness\nargument. They said: Well, this is a scrivener's\nerror; we only left this out for 3 months -- which\nisn't true, by the way. They left it out for 5 years.\nBut the court said: Well, if that's true\nand if this is going to be windfall, maybe Xerox has\nan equitable defense. This is an (a)(1)(B) claim\nfor -- under the terms of the plan, but they remanded\nthis to the lower court out of consideration for\nXerox, so that the lower court could look at equitable\nprinciples and say: Well, since the plan doesn't\nforeclose an appreciation, maybe under equity we\nshould have some appreciation.\nAnd then what happened -- and this is the\nirony -- is Xerox went back -- and this right out of\npage 143a of the joint appendix -- they proposed an\noffset that effectively is an undisclosed $16 million\nappreciation. Here's why this is important: Their\nphantom account in the first round, it was an\nundisclosed $17 million appreciation.\nThey didn't come in and say -- they made\nequitable arguments. If you look at their briefs,\nthey said: We're -- we're not saying that this is\nwhat the plan means, but the plan has been\ninvalidated; we're going to make equitable arguments\nof things that might be consistent with the plan.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if I could\nswitch to the deference point. Let's say you have an\nadministrator who says I interpret this particular\nprovision to mean A; and he says but, if that's\nrejected, there are these other provisions that should\nbe read to mean B. That goes up; the court -- the\nrejects A.\nDoes the administrator get deference on his\nreading of the other provisions B?\nMR. STRIS: The position I -- I would take:\nI think if they did them at the same time -- it's a\ndifficult question -- I think they would, because I\nthink if you give them at the same time and you admit\nthat there is an ambiguity, you're giving the court\noptions. You are saying: Defer to my judgment; I\nthink this is right, but here's the alternative.\nWhat Xerox did here, and this is very\nimportant: They made the strategic choice in round\none of this litigation to say we think there is one\noption, it's terrible for -- for Petitioners --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but I think it's\nkind of odd to say to the administrator: Look, if you\nwant discretion, you should make as many rulings as\nyou can possibly think of because then you'll get\ndiscretion as to each of them. But if you only do\nwhat's efficient and say here's how I read it, then\nyou don't get any discretion at all on the other\nprovisions.\nMR. STRIS: No, I -- I don't -- well, I\nguess I would give two answers to that. The first is,\nin the first instance, if you seriatim said here are\n12 different interpretations of the plan in ranked\norder, I don't think you would get deference. I think\nfor efficiency's sake, like you say, we want\nadministrators to say: This is what we think the\ninterpretation of the plan is. I agree with you.\nBut in a rare case like this one -- where\nXerox's main point is: We screwed up; we left out the\nprovision -- I think the appropriate thing for Xerox\nto do would have said: We think we can rely on it and\ntake this interpretation, even though we left out the\nprovision; but if not, then this is how we interpret\nthe plan. I'm not saying you would -- they would\ndefinitely get deference, but at least there would be\nan argument that there's a presumption of competence,\nthat there's efficiency.\nHere, the standard trust law rule, which I'm\ngoing to get to in a second, says: You staked your\nground, Xerox. You said that this is what you thought\nthe plan meant. We held that you were arbitrary and\ncapricious, not an -- not an honest -- not a small\nprocedural mistake. You -- you picked something that\nwas unreasonable, and now you want a second bite at\nthe apple.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're saying\nit's not just that they abused their discretion;\nthey're discretion abusers? You can't trust them on\nthe next provision?\nMR. STRIS: No. Yes, I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We do that with the\ndistrict court. We get a district court, and we use\nall of these pejorative terms -- \"abuse of\ndiscretion,\" \"arbitrary and capricious,\" \"clear error\"\n-- and we send it back for them to do the same -- you\nknow, they make -\nMR. STRIS: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're the\nfact finder. Here, the plan administrator is the\nprimary interpreter.\nMR. STRIS: And -- and this is the core\nanswer to your question: That is why the law, under\nthe common law of trusts, said that once there was a\nfinding by a court of abuse of discretion, it could\ndecide to defer.\nI agree with Xerox. Ordinarily, the courts\nwould defer. Under ERISA, ordinarily, if there's\nfactual issues, they send it back.\nHere, the court said, under these specific\nfacts, under this abuse of discretion, for a host of\nreasons, not the least of which, Your Honor, is that\nthey are trying to take a fallback position on the\nexact same issue, which the court expressly found in\nthis case.\nThey exercised their discretion not to\ndefer. The rule -- in order for Xerox to get reversal\non the first question, they have to convince this\nCourt that what the rule should be is that, not\nthat -- not -- we don't have to convince you that\nthere should be -- there shouldn't be deference in all\nof these cases. They have to convince you that a\nlower court never has the option, unless there's a\nfinding of bad faith, to say, yeah, I'm not going\nto defer. And that's not the law.\nThis very Court, in 1888, in the Colton\ncase, which the government cites in their brief, and\nwe -- and we cite, there -- the trustee said: We're\nnot giving a benefit. The Court said: That's\narbitrary and capricious. This Court ordered the\nlower courts to set the benefit. They never made a\nfinding of bad faith.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if this is a\ndiscretionary decision for the court that finds the\ninitial abuse of discretion by the administrator, what\nare the factors -- what are the relevant factors in\ndetermining whether the administrator should get a\nsecond shot and which ones are present in this case?\nMR. STRIS: Okay. I'm -- I'm going to tell\nyou the factors that existed at trust law and in ERISA\nand that I think they are right. One very important\nfactor is: Is it the exact same question? And here\nit was. It was the same question. I disagree with\nMr. Long's characterization.\nThey took a position as an alternative on\nthe meaning of section 9.6 under this plan. Now, they\nwant to say, well, now, we're going to rely on\ndifferent provisions, in addition to the one we did\nbefore, but, I mean -- Justice Scalia, to your\nquestion earlier -- that would be like saying: Here's\na contract; I think that we -- I interpret this\nprovision looking at pages 1 and 2. You hold that I\nacted in an arbitrary fashion. And I say, okay, I\nwant to interpret it again; I'm going to look at 1 and\n2, but this time, I'm going to look at pages 7, 8, 9;\nit's a new issue because I didn't consider those --\nthose points before. It's still the same question, so\nthat's one factor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not the same question.\nWhen the court has held that 1 and 2 was, in effect,\nnot in the contract because you didn't give enough\nnotice of it. So now you have a contract without 1\nand 2 in it.\nMR. STRIS: Oh, I -- I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it's a different\nquestion. What does this contract mean without 1 and\n2? Now, you may have a different point, if -- if you\nsay that what -- and it seems to me you did say this,\nthat the court of appeal -- the court of appeals, not\nonly decided that there was no notice and, therefore,\nthis provision wasn't any good, but you claim that the\ncourt of appeals also said that you cannot account for\nthe time value of money.\nMR. STRIS: Yes, I -- I wouldn't exactly say\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- now, that would be\na totally different case.\nMR. STRIS: Yes. What the court of\nappeal --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I didn't read it that\nway.\nMR. STRIS: No. What the court of appeals\nsaid -- now, actually, there's three things I'd like\nto respond to, and I want to get back to the factors.\nThe court of appeals said the SPDs did not disclose an\nappreciation.\nThe -- the court of appeals said that the\nrelevant provision in this plan, the only one that\nwould have applied time value of money was missing,\nbut I argue that the consequence of these things is\nthat you can't have a time value of money. So I am\ngoing to get to that in a second.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a little different.\nMR. STRIS: Now, to the last point you made\nabout it's a different issue. I think we're saying\nthe same thing. This is semantic. Yes, Xerox is\nright, that the task was slightly different. The\nfirst time, they interpreted what the offset should be\nunder the '89 plan, looking at a few things, and this\ntime, they said, oh, we were arbitrary, so, now, we\nwould like to resolve the same legal question, looking\nat a few more things.\nSo, in one sense --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why -- why -- as I\nunderstand it -- which big if -- you and I are both\nworking at Xerox, and in year 1 -- and we each have\n500,000 in our contribution account, and you leave,\nand you take the 500,000. I stay, and I don't. Okay?\nNow, my 500,000 over the next 10 years is\ngoing to grow somewhat -- as long as it wasn't 2007.\nBut it --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STRIS: Or -- or you may spend it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I might spend it,\nbut if I leave it there, it would grow, okay. But\nsome -- some people leave it there, they grow.\nMR. STRIS: During my time, it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, when figuring the\nfloor, what Xerox does is look to see how much it\ngrew. They look at the whole thing, now, 10 years\nlater, and they say, you're up above the floor,\ngood-bye, we will give you this, not the floor, okay.\nNow, you are in the same position, and you\nhappen to come back to Xerox, and all they want to do\nis say, you know, we'd like to assume yours grew, too,\nI mean, not -- a little, anyway, and the first thing\nthey wanted to do is to say it should have grown the\nsame way we treat our own guys, as it having grown.\nAnd the court of appeals says that's wrong\nbecause you left the words out, but send it back to\nsee it's fair. So then the expert comes in, and the\nexpert says, well, they didn't want to give us that\nway to grow it; here is how -- we will assume it grew\nlike an insurance company, the most incredibly\nconservative people in the world, how -- how they\nwould have treated it as growing, if you bought an\nannuity right then, and that just gives us even a\nlower number.\nAnd -- and they want to say, why didn't you\nat least listen to that, instead of coming to the fact\nwhich is very, very unusual, it didn't grow at all, in\nwhich case, you are eligible for the floor.\nMR. STRIS: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I think that's why they\nthink it's either an abuse of discretion or you should\nhave listened more to the -- to the expert -- should\nhave done something else.\nMR. STRIS: I -- I understand that entirely.\nI'd like to say a few things. All of these points\nwould be very important if we were designing a plan in\nthe first place. I'm not suggesting that the result\nin this case is what parties would bargain to in the\nfirst instance, if they had all the information. I'm\nnot going to defend that.\nThe question here is Xerox left a provision\nout of the plan, and now we have a problem. What are\nwe going to do? That's how we get to equity.\nIn fact, I think it would have been\nappropriate -- if I were litigating the case at that\npoint, I would have argued you can't have an equitable\ndefense, you need to enforce the nominal offset, but\nthat ship has sailed.\nSo we go back on remand, and to -- to\nMr. Long's point about how it's standard to have an\nactuarial offset -- take isclosure away for a\nminute. It's not standard to apply the -- the time\nvalue of money to the entire defined contribution\nbalance. I will not accept that characterization.\nUnder the principle of duplication, we\npresented an alternative that used the time value of\nmoney offset, but it applied it to the relevant\nprinciple. Xerox didn't like that, so they -- they\nadvocated something else. Here's why it's relevant to\nyour question --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. What's\nthe relevant principle? Isn't it what the lump sum\nwas that he took out?\nMR. STRIS: I don't think so. This is a\ndefined benefits plan, and -- you know, from a\nregulatory standpoint, as this case comes to this\nCourt, it is a defined benefits plan. Section 9.6 of\nthe plan talks about non-duplication.\nWith no other information, if -- if you\nforce me to say, well, let's make an argument, what\nare we going to think about non-duplication, we're\ntrying to say that we're not going to give you money\nunder this floor -- as you put it, Justice Breyer --\nof the defined benefits plan, if it duplicates your\nprior defined benefit payment.\nWhat my clients got was from an entirely\nseparate plan, and it was a defined contribution plan.\nThey're integrated --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they chose to\ntake it out of that plan, right?\nMR. STRIS: I actually think that's not\ntrue. It's not clear from the record, but my\nunderstanding is that most of my clients didn't --\ndidn't have that option.\nNow, I'd like to get back, just for a\nsecond, Justice Alito, to your question, because it\ngoes to the core of deference. Another very important\nfactor is, are there fact questions?\nAnd this is important because you're\nthinking about broad principle. This comes up in\nERISA all the time. I see this all the time. Even\nafter an abuse of discretion, courts regularly say, we\nare going to send this back, because they're not going\nto be in the business of holding evidentiary hearings\nand looking at complicated fact questions.\nSo that's a factor that -- where you might\nsay, you know what? They abused their discretion, but\nI'm sending it back. Not only was that not an issue\nhere, the lower courts explicitly held that they\nwaived this, they didn't want it sent back.\nAnother important factor is whether or not\nit's a regulatory infraction --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Are you talking\nabout the court of appeals sending it back to the\ndistrict court, or are you talking about the district\ncourt sending it back to the administrator?\nMR. STRIS: I'm saying that, when the court\nof appeals sent it back to the district court, the\ndistrict court never even considered sending it to the\nadministrator because there would be no reason to do\nthat. They didn't ask for it. This isn't one of those\ncases, where there's -- it's a medical case, where you\nneed new evidentiary hearings on whether someone's\nsick. This goes to Justice Alito's question of in\nwhich cases, after an abuse of discretion, are courts\nlikely to defer? That's a factor where they are.\nLet me give you another one. If you have a\nminor procedural infraction -- and this case is\nanything but -- the disclosures were wrong for 5\nyears, and contrary to Mr. Long's claim, this wasn't\nmissing from the plan for 3 months. This was missing\nfrom the plan for --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, since that's a\nfairly stark disagreement among counsel on a factual\nmatter, where in the record do you see 5 years?\nMR. STRIS: Pages -- pages 29a and 30a of\nthe petition appendix. You have to read it very\ncarefully, and I know this stuff is boring, and I\napologize, but this is the first time that the offset\nwas reinserted.\nIt was in 1993, in section 1.45(f), that\nXerox finally put the offset back. Here's the\nconfusion. They keep referring to this 1990\namendment. The 1990 amendment, which is invalid, it\ndidn't put an offset back. It just put in the words\n\"phantom account.\" It was -- it -- it created a\nphantom entitlement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It put in the words\n\"phantom account\"?\nMR. STRIS: It put in the words \"phantom\naccount,\" but the words \"phantom account\" were already\nin the '89 restatement. If you look in -- at section\n1.35, and it's in the joint appendix. It's page 19a\nof the joint appendix.\nThis is the definition of \"retirement\naccount.\" This is the account that actually applies\nto my clients. There's a phantom account here. There\nhas always been the phantom account in the plan. They\nremoved the offset. So this -- the relevant thing is\nthe offset, and it's been gone for 5 years.\nNow, to get back to this deference question\nwhich I -- I think is important because these factors\nmatter. Let's take the Second Circuit. The Second\nCircuit regularly defers after an abuse of discretion.\nThe U.S. points this out -- where do they point it\nout -- page 23 of their brief. The Miller v. United\nWelfare Fund case out of the Second Circuit does\nprecisely what Xerox says the Second Circuit\noverruled. So, unquestionably, the Second Circuit\nrealized that it could defer, but it chose not to\nhere.\nThis wasn't a small procedural infraction.\nThis wasn't you have to decide in 30 days, and Xerox\ntook 33 days to decide. This was Xerox sending\npersonal benefit statements to people for 5 years that\nsaid you're going to get $2,000, you are going to get\n$3,000. The -- the summary plan description in this\ncase, it's on page 47a. It says the amount you\nreceive may also be reduced if you have previously\nleft the company and received a distribution at that\ntime.\nMr. Long gets up here -- and I understand\nwhat he's saying -- he says, we have to disclose\neverything in a summary plan description? How's it\ngoing to be a summary? No, we suggest that you have\nto say there is going to be some appreciation. You\nhave to do something to suggest to average plan\nparticipants that there's going to be a 20 percent\ninterest rate, an 8.5 percent interest rate, that it's\ngoing to apply to your entire distribution.\nAnd that's what the lower court decided\nhere. They were there; they saw the facts; they found\nthat there was an abuse of discretion. And -- and\nthey said: You know what -- in this rare case -- and\nit is rare in the Second Circuit -- they said in this\nrare case, because of this particular abuse of\ndiscretion that involves the same issue, that involves\nstatutory disclosure violations, that involved Xerox\ntrying to pay people $5.31 a month when they told them\nthey were paying them $2,300 a month, we're not going\nto defer. And they went the extra mile.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We can handle those\nfacts --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: They have not had --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We can handle those facts\njust as easily as the district court.\nMR. STRIS: Of course.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We -- we don't have to look\nat the witness's demeanor.\nMR. STRIS: That's true. I wouldn't wish it\nupon you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, just because a\ndecision has some factual basis -- every decision has\nsome factual basis. That doesn't mean that -- that an\nappellate court, including this one, can't decide the\nquestions.\nMR. STRIS: I agree with you. It wouldn't\n-- I wasn't suggesting the contrary.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you keep stressing\nthat -- you know, the district court was there and saw\nthese facts? That's fine --\nMR. STRIS: Oh -- ohh -- here's why I\nthink it's -- I was unclear. Here's why I think that\nis important. The law at trust law was that there is\na bright-line rule. The bright-line rule was, once\nthere is an abuse of discretion, the court gets to\ndecide will you continue to defer. Xerox isn't coming\nbefore you and saying that the court of appeals here\nabused its discretion in choosing not to defer.\nThey're advocating a bright-line rule that says a\ncourt must defer unless there is a finding of bad\nfaith. And so my point --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But defer doesn't\nmean uphold in every circumstance, does it?\nMR. STRIS: No. Defer means if it was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay, well, then I\ndon't think it's proper to say they can choose not to\ndefer. They can defer and -- and choose to find it's\nstill an abuse of discretion.\nMR. STRIS: Oh, that's true, Your Honor, but\nthat's flatly not happened at trust law. If you look\nat the cases that the government cites on -- in their\nbrief, it's pages 17 and 18. They cite a host of\ncases.\nIf you look at the Colton case, if you look\nat the quote directly from the leading Bogert\ntreatise, there are many cases like this one where the\ncourt said: We're not going to give you a second\nchance. We're -- not just that we are going to listen\nto you and not -- and not give you deference -- we're\ngoing to listen to you and disagree; we are not going\nto listen to you.\nAnd that's the rule that we and the\ngovernment are advocating. It was the law at trust\nlaw and out of Fidelity to Glenn and Firestone.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just so I\nunderstand, there are two different views. One is we\nare going to listen to you, and we may not agree with\nyou. And the other is we're not even going to listen\nto you. And you are arguing for the second rule. You\nthink the proper way to approach this is saying we\ndon't care, plan administrator, what you think.\nMR. STRIS: May I answer that?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, sure.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STRIS: Okay. I didn't want to be\npresumptuous.\nI would characterize it slightly\ndifferently. I would say that under the first rule,\nyou listen and if you think it's reasonable, you maybe\nconsider as a factor where the line of reasonableness\nis, but you reject it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. STRIS: I'm saying that was not the law,\nthat has never been the law. The law is, once there\nhas been an abuse of discretion, the court has the\nright to say we're going to decide for ourselves, we\nare going to decide what's reasonable, and if you\ncharacterize that as not listening to you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They don't even need\nto accept a brief from the plan administrator --\nMR. STRIS: I don't think it would ever\nhappen, but that's how it worked at trust law. They\nwouldn't have to. But I think courts are more\nreasonable than that.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Roberts.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS,\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING RESPONDENTS\nMR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen a plan administrator has abused its\ndiscretion in construing plan terms, courts are not\nrequired to defer to the plan administrator's fallback\ninterpretation of the same terms. That rule follows\nfrom trust law, and a contrary rule would undermine\nERISA's protections for plan participants. It would\nreduce incentives for administrators to interpret\nplans reasonably; it would discourage participants\nfrom challenging unreasonable benefit denials; and it\nwould make employers less likely to draft clear plans.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if I don't think it's\nthe same terms?\nMR. ROBERTS: If you don't think it's the\nsame terms, that would present a -- a different\nquestion about whether deference was required. But\nstill deference would have been inappropriate here,\nbecause the fallback interpretation by the plan\nadministrator presented the same notice problems that\nthe original phantom account interpretation had\nprovided, because the summary plan description didn't\nprovide notice that there would be an appreciated\noffset.\nBut the rule that the court of appeals\nadopted was that deference was not required when it\nwas the same terms, and the court of appeals found\nthat. I don't think this Court needs to -- in\nresolving that, to decide whether it was the same\nterms here. We think it -- it was, because the -- the\nPetitioners made two argument in defending their\ninitial benefits determination. One was we can apply\nthe post-1998 terms, and the other one was, even\napplying the 1989 plan, that authorizes use of the\nphantom account, because of the non-duplication of\nbenefits provision. And now they have come back on\nremand and they're saying well, no, we're now reading\nthe non-duplication of benefits provision differently.\nAnd that's the -- that's the same plan terms.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the\nhypothetical I asked your friend? You know, this is\nhow we read the provision, reading A, and we\nrecognize there's some ambiguity there, and if a\ncourt disagrees with it, our -- our second reading is\n-- is B.\nMR. ROBERTS: No. We --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No deference on B?\nMR. ROBERTS: We think there would be no\ndifference on B if it was just a second reading of the\nsame -- of the same term. Under that logic --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does that make\nsense? I mean, don't you want the administrators to\ngive you their best -- best understanding?\nMR. ROBERTS: You want the administrators to\ngive their most reasonable interpretation, but under\nthe logic of letting them be able to put the first\ninterpretation there, they could just put a list of 10\ninterpretations --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, they can --\nMR. ROBERTS: -- starting with the one\nthat's most favorable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They can -- they can\ntake it to the extreme. But if it looks like a good\nfaith effort, to say -- you know, it's tough to\ninterpret and administer these plans, and they say,\nthis is what we think it means, but we're human; maybe\nwe made a mistake. And this is --\nMR. ROBERTS: Then a court might choose to\ndefer if it thought there was no reason to think\nthat there was -- that there was a reason to suspect\nthat they're just trying --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're being careful not to\nnot to say \"bad faith.\" There was no bad faith here?\nMR. ROBERTS: No, they wouldn't have to find\nbad faith.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm looking for -- I'm\nstill not sure of the standard.\nMR. ROBERTS: The standard would be --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm the district judge,\nand I want to defer in -- in case A and not in case B.\nWhat -- what's the difference?\nMR. ROBERTS: Ordinarily, if we are talking\nabout they have put forward an interpretation, now\nthey want to put forward a fallback interpretation,\ngenerally, if -- generally, if they have -- haven't\nput that forward before, we think that deference\nwouldn't be appropriate, because they had the\nopportunity to address the issue, and the\nunreasonableness of the initial interpretation\nsuggests that they may not act reasonably on remand.\nAnd --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So one strike and\nyou're out?\nMR. ROBERTS: No. According --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, that's\nassuming, it seems to me -- it makes sense if there's\nbad faith.\nMR. ROBERTS: According --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, you make\nfallback arguments. You're here and say this is how\nwe read this, but if you don't agree with it, this is\nhow we read it.\nMR. ROBERTS: That's right, and -- but there\nare -- there are concerns here about undermining\nERISA's protections for plan participants that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts, I thought\nyou said in this -- in this case -- and we're only\ndealing with this case -- there was the same basic\nproblem, the same flaw in the second interpretation.\nAnd you said in both cases, they wouldn't satisfy\nERISA's notice requirement.\nMR. ROBERTS: That's right. Because ERISA\nrequires the summary plan description to identify any\ncircumstances that will result in an offset, to\ndescribe the offset in a manner calculated to be\nunderstood by the average plan participant, and not to\nminimize the significance of the offset.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Then I don't understand what\nthe purpose of the remand from the Second Circuit to\nthe district court, after the Second Circuit's first\ndecision, was.\nIn other words, you're saying that they --\nthey found that anything other than an offset for the\namount of money that was actually received by the\nbeneficiary upon leaving Xerox would be -- would\nviolate the notice requirements.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, I don't --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So that interprets the plan.\nThere's nothing left to do, then.\nMR. ROBERTS: I don't know that the -- that\nthe court of appeals actually found that the first\ntime around. Our point is that that was the\nconsequence of the lack of notice that was in -- in\nthe summary plan description.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I understand you to be\nsaying that the concept of any appreciation of that\namount based on the time value of money is invalid,\nbecause there wasn't proper notice for that. So\nthere's nothing left to do on remand, it seems to me.\nI don't understand what the purpose of the\nremand was.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, I -- we -- we think in\nmost cases, it would have been an abuse of discretion\nfor the district court in light of the lack of notice\nin the summary plan description to apply an\nappreciated offset. But the district court also did\nconsider the reasonable expectations of the plan --\nplan participants, and there might have been other\ncountervailing considerations that could have been\nadvanced by the -- the plan administrator, perhaps,\nabout the financial solvency of the plan or some other\nmatters, but -- but those weren't presented here.\nThe point is that, once the court -- when\nthe court remanded, the first task for the district\ncourt on remand was to look at the plan terms because\nthis was a benefit action, determine whether those\nplan terms addressed how to calculate the offset, but\nhere, the court couldn't rely on the plan terms,\nreally, for two reasons.\nFirst, as the district court said, the plan\nsaid virtually nothing about how to do it; and,\nsecond, the point that I was making before, ERISA\nprohibited the court from adopting an interpretation\nthat provided for more than the -- an offset greater\nthan the face value.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, in principle, if -- if\nwe accept your argument, if other retirees who are\nlater rehired bring a lawsuit in another court, you\nmight have a different result because it would be up\nto the -- up to that court to decide what was -- what\nwas a proper result, right?\nMR. ROBERTS: In the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the consequence of\nnot deferring to the plan administrator. You have --\nMR. ROBERTS: If the plan -- if the plan\nterms -- in an ordinary case, if there was an abuse of\ndiscretion in interpreting the plan terms, the plan\nterms would still address the issue. There wouldn't\nbe an additional violation of ERISA's notice\nrequirement.\nThis is a unique case, in the sense that,\nhere, you've got not just an arbitrary -- an\nunreasonable interpretation of the plan terms, but\nyou've also got the problem of the lack of notice in\nthe summary plan description, and you've also got the\nproblem that the plan terms are really silent on this\nissue.\nThey just don't say anything about how to\ncalculate the offset.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's a pretty big windfall\nfor people. You're working at Xerox, and your plan is\nabout approaching the minimum level -- let's quit and\nthen go invest it, and then come back 3 days before\nyou're bound to retire, and then you're going get\nwhatever the plan grew, and you'll also get your\nminimum.\nMR. ROBERTS: I don't think it's a windfall,\nYour Honor, because it depends on what the employees\nwere promised when they were deciding whether to come\nback.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why would anyone\npromise them that kind of a deal?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well -- first of all, when\nyou've got a defined benefit plan and defined\ncontribution plan, there's no requirement in ERISA,\nand employers frequently -- or at least, sometimes,\nwould not offset the defined contribution benefits\nfrom the defined benefit plan, and even in a floor\noffset arrangement, where they would, an employer\ncould provide less than the full amount --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about -- a bit more\nserious question -- I mean, that is a serious\nquestion, but the more general question, what about\nsomething that is analogous to Skidmore deference?\nMR. ROBERTS: Oh, God.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you say --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: You say -- you take the --\nthe district judge here can take -- takes the\nadministrator's opinion for what it's worth.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He has to listen to it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can we go back to the urns?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, that's essentially --\nthat's essentially the -- the principle that we're --\nthat we're talking about --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That is essentially the\nprinciple, I thought.\nMR. ROBERTS: The court's not required to\napply its use of discretion and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But he does have to read\nit. He has to read it --\nMR. ROBERTS: -- review again.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Read it, and take it for\nwhat it's worth.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if --\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, it's -- I think any\nresponsible district court would -- would do that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You don't think they\nwould -- you think they would do that?\nMR. ROBERTS: They would do that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Okay.\nMR. ROBERTS: Of course.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you disagree with\nMr. Stris. Do you think the district court should\nlisten to what the plan administrator has to say?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, I think that, in trust\nlaw, that -- under the principles of trust law, that\nMr. Stris is correct, that the district court has\nthe -- the -- the court would have discretion to\nformulate the remedy and could direct the trustee --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- is it --\nMr. Roberts, is it a remedy? So that's -- one thing\nis you can view this as the district court as\nsubstitute interpreter of the plan, or another way you\ncan look at it is to say, the -- the benefit\ndetermination was wrong, we reject it, the court\nrejects it. So, now, there is a remedy for that\nwrongful determination. So is this, what's going on\nin the district court, an interpretation of the plan\nor a remedy for a wrongful determination?\nMR. ROBERTS: In a benefits action, the\nfirst question is to interpret the plan, but what you\nhave here is a plan that is silent and a plan that --\nwhere interpreting the plan to provide for a certain\nkind of offset, there is inadequate notice in the\nsummary plan description, so there's a violation of\nERISA.\nSo, in this circumstance, not ordinarily,\nwhenever there's a misinterpretation of the plan, but\nin the circumstances here, it is a remedial decision\nbecause the court has to fill the gap in the plan\nthat's the result of the silence of the plan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we interpret gaps in\n-- in documents all the time. That's part of\ninterpreting a document, figuring out what it provides\nfor in a lot of situations that it does not explicitly\ncover. I don't know why that isn't interpreting the\nplan.\nMR. ROBERTS: When -- the analogy here is\nto the trust law situation, where trusts -- where --\nwhere courts modify the terms of a trust because the\nterms are illegal or there's a change of\ncircumstances, like the cy pres doctrine.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nThank you.\nMr. Long, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. LONG: The remaining plan terms are not\nsilent. Section 9.6 says that the offset should be\nthe accrued benefit attributable to the prior lump-sum\ndistribution, and that's an annuity payable at age 65.\nSo there is plan language.\nIt's -- it is not completely unambiguous,\nbut the plan is certainly not silent, and the\nSolicitor General, in its brief on the merits to this\nCourt did -- retracted that suggestion that the plan\nwas silent.\nOn this question of the 1990 amendment and\nwhen the -- the reconstructed account methodology that\nthe Second Circuit said was invalid got put back in,\npages 66a and 67a of the appendix to the petition\nshows that that got put back in, in 1990, and not\nlater.\nOn trust law and what trust law shows,\nobviously, the Court will have to sort it out, but we\nstand with Professor Scott, with his treatise, which\nis key, to the Restatement Second, which was in effect\nwhen ERISA was adopted. Section 187 of his treatise,\nwhich correlates with section 187 of the Restatement\nSecond, we think supports our approach that, unless\nthere is bad faith or the trustee is acting outside\nthe bounds of discretion -- and the court will get the\ntrustee within the bounds of discretion, but unless\nthere is some reason to think the trustee can't fairly\nand honestly exercise the discretion, the terms of the\ntrust assign that responsibility to the trustee, and,\ntherefore, the trustee should exercise that\ndiscretion.\nAnd then, finally, on this question of\nnotice and whether there was adequate notice, not of\nthe reconstructed account methodology, but of the\nplain vanilla annuity, the ordinary way this is done,\nwe would urge the Court not to accept these\nrepresentations that, oh, it's just the same question;\nif the notice for one is inadequate, the notice for\nthe other must also be inadequate.\nI mean, there's actually Second Circuit law,\nthe McCarthy against Dun & Bradstreet case, that holds\nthat a summary plan description does not have to\ncompletely explain how you do every offset and\nactuarial adjustment. There are so many of them.\nMany of them apply just to relatively small groups of\npeople, including this one that we're talking about.\nThere are 14,000 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the court of appeals\nheld that this one was inadequate because it did not\nsay that you were going to take into account the time\nvalue of money. If that's the reason it held that\nthis one was bad, the same reason would apply to the\nplain vanilla.\nMR. LONG: Well, if the court had actually\nheld that -- I mean, I would urge you not to read the\ncourt's opinion that way. I mean, I think, if it held\nthat, I think that would be a mistake because there --\nthere are -- you know, it's just so typical that you\nhave actuarial adjustments in pensions and in -- and\nin general.\nI mean, people don't expect to take out a\nmortgage on a house for 20 years and pay no interest\nor buy a bond from the Treasury for 20 years and\nreceive no interest. So I think, if it's going to be\nthe ordinary, plain vanilla way this is done, the PBGC\nway, the safe harbor way, it may be sufficient -- may\nvery well be sufficient to simply --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Long, would you --\nwould you explain your position on the picture we were\ngiven of these people who were rehired and -- and they\nget, periodically, a statement that says, you are\ngoing to get 2,000-some-odd dollars; and then, 5 years\nlater, they get a statement that says, no, it's only\n$5.18, or something like that.\nMR. LONG: Right, and -- and those\nstatements, which are non-plan documents, said\nthere -- there may be an adjustment or there will be\nan adjustment for prior distributions. And in a case\nlike Mr. Frommert's, that's the $5 case, the reason\nit's $5 is because his entire defined contribution\nbenefit virtually came from that large lump sum.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And not even about why --\nwhy it was $5. It's why did he get notices that gave\nhim the perception he was going to get over 2,000 when\nit was so much less?\nMR. LONG: Well, because those -- those\nparticular forms, which again are not plan documents\nand he really should show individual reliance and\nprejudice, didn't do the calculation. He got another\ndocument that did do the calculation, and that's when\nthis started.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nCounsel.\n"
