        "content": "(10:01 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Danforth v. Minnesota.\nMr. Butler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. BUTLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BUTLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn this case, the Minnesota Supreme Court\nheld that this Court had prevented it from deciding for\nitself which State prisoners can go into Minnesota State\ncourts to raise Federal constitutional challenges to\ntheir conviction. This is incorrect.\nA State court is free to fashion -- the\nState courts are free to fashion their own jurisprudence\nas to who may raise a Federal constitutional question in\nState court in the context that if you hear State courts\nand State legislatures can make their own policy\ndecisions about the costs and benefits of allowing State\nprisoners to challenge their otherwise final convictions\nbased on new rules of Federal constitutional criminal --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I propose if the\nState of Minnesota really cared about this, it could\nhave its own confrontation rule. Does it have a\nconfrontation rule?\nMR. BUTLER: The State constitution, Justice\nKennedy, has a confrontation clause. Its jurisprudence\non the confrontation clause, its own, is identical to\nthis Court's jurisprudence. So, yes, theoretically, a\nPetitioner could always go in and make a State court\nchallenge to his State court conviction. The question\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That means the State isn't\nnecessarily tied in knots. It has the option to do\nsubstantively what it chooses.\nMR. BUTLER: The question in this case, Your\nHonor, I think, is that whether -- is the question of\nwhether it has to. Yes, a State prisoner can make a\nState court challenge to his conviction. The question\nis, does he have to? In this case, Mr. Danforth\nchallenges his conviction under the Federal\nConstitution.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, page 2 of your reply\nbrief, the yellow brief, you take issue with the State,\nand you say the State is wrong if there is a decision\neither way on the confrontation clause and it's\nquestionable under Federal law, we can review it. I can\nconcede that's right, but that doesn't get you home.\nThat's the problem.\nMR. BUTLER: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That is the problem.\nYou're now creating a regime in which State courts are\nreaching questions that we said ought not to be reached\nfor final convictions.\nMR. BUTLER: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that was the basis on\nwhich we decided Crawford.\nMR. BUTLER: Your Honor, it's simply a\nregime under which the State court, as it can in any\nnumber of other contexts, can choose to consider the\nmerits of a litigant's claim. The Federal question --\nthe Federal question here is -- well, there are two. In\nthis case, it's whether Federal law prevents the State\ncourt from hearing it, but the substantive Federal\nquestion is whether Mr. Danforth's conviction violates\nthe confrontation clause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you think that our\nholding in Teague was that it did, but we're not going\nto let you out of jail?\nMR. BUTLER: I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think that's really\nwhat we said in Teague, that even though your\nconstitutional rights were violated, we're going to\nforeclose the remedy of habeas corpus? I -- I find it\ndifficult to believe that that -- you know, any\nresponsible court could make such a determination.\nMR. BUTLER: Your Honor, what the Teague\nCourt did was set up a procedural and a prudential limit\non a defense available for the State in the particular\nform of habeas corpus.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That issue is not a\nnecessary part of your case at all, but you don't have\nto suggest that you could depart. You could do less\nthan Teague. For example, Griffith. You can accept\nthat as a given because it doesn't touch your case.\nIsn't that so?\nMR. BUTLER: That's correct, Your Honor.\nGriffith sets forth, as we see it, the minimum\nrequirements of Federal law, that a new rule must be\napplied to all cases that were pending when the new rule\nis announced. That's what the Federal Constitution\nrequires.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Federal rules\ndon't have minimums and maximums. They have a rule.\nAnd as Justice Kennedy pointed out, you can have a State\nrule under the State constitution that goes further. It\nseems to me that the States' determination to apply\nCrawford retroactively must be based on a disagreement\nwith this Court's Teague analysis, which refers back to\nthe substantive elements of Crawford. So, in other\nwords, the disagreement at bottom is a disagreement\nabout how to read the substantive requirements of\nCrawford.\nMR. BUTLER: Respectfully, Mr. Chief\nJustice, I don't think that's necessarily true. I think\nthe disagreement, if there is one, is with this Court's\npolicy decision in Teague to -- that the Court announced\nin Teague as to whether to allow such challenges.\nThere's no disagreement as to the substance of Crawford\nor to the substance of the Sixth Amendment. Nobody has\never reached that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do you --\nI understand your point. Teague has both elements to\nit. But if you're applying Teague, there are certain\nexceptions that are based on exactly what the underlying\nright is, what the Crawford right is. Is it a watershed\nrule? Is it something else? And the court makes a\ndetermination as a matter of Federal law on those\npoints. And what you're arguing for is discretion in\nthe State to disagree with those substantive\ndeterminations.\nMR. BUTLER: What we're arguing for,\nMr. Chief Justice, is discretion in the State to\ndisagree with the general policy rule that a court will\nnot consider a new rule when considering the validity of\na conviction on, in Teague's case, habeas or on\ncollateral review.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a general policy\nrule, but it may well, as in the Crawford case, as a\ngood example, have affected this Court's initial\ndetermination to strike off in a new direction. We did\nso knowing that there's a possibility that we wouldn't\nupset final convictions.\nMR. BUTLER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I think it is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- to that effect.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it not a substantive\ndetermination of Federal law when you say that this\nconstitutional change that we're making in this case or\nthat we have made in a past case is not retroactive?\nThat means there was no constitutional violation in the\npast prior to the announcement of this case, and what\nthe State -- what you want the State court to be able to\nsay is yes, there is a Federal constitutional violation\nfor which we're going to give a remedy in habeas.\nMR. BUTLER: I think, Justice Scalia and\nJustice Kennedy, if I could address your points in turn,\non Justice Scalia's question about whether there was or\nwas not a constitutional violation, if the Court is\nreally holding that there was -- that something -- that\nthere was no constitutional violation at the time\nPetitioner's conviction became final or at the time\nMr. Bockting's conviction became final in the habeas\ncase, then what the Court is really holding is that\nCrawford didn't just interpret the confrontation clause;\nit somehow changed the confrontation clause, that the\nconfrontation clause meant -- that the confrontation\nclause said one thing at one point and now says\nsomething else.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think that's exactly what\nCrawford means, and I think that's exactly what\nhappened. That's what it means, whether it's a new\nrule. What does a new rule mean? It means it didn't\nused to be the rule, but it is the rule after this case.\nNow, you can argue, and there are many\noriginalists who would agree with you, that there\nshouldn't be such a thing as a new rule, but once you've\n-- once you've agreed that there can be new rules, if\nthis Court says this is a new rule, we acknowledge it\nwasn't the rule before, but it's new, it will not have\nretroactive effect, it seems to me that the State would\nbe contradicting that ruling by saying oh, in our view\nthe law used to be exactly what you say it newly is.\nMR. BUTLER: But the question, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But your basic position is\nthat we should not be making new law. We should be --\nwe might have misinterpreted the law over the years,\nbut, basically, this Court has no power to change the\ntext of the Constitution or its meaning. I guess\nJustice Scalia's position is we have all that power in\nthe world.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: My position is we have\nasserted all that power in the world.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is -- there is\n-- it's not as though we have a new rule, and we apply\nit from this day forward. Crawford is retroactive at\nleast for cases that are not yet final. When they were\non trial, Crawford wasn't there, but maybe somewhere\ntoward the end of the appellate process, lo and behold,\nthey can take advantage of it.\nSo it's a question of where you want to cut\nit off. And at one time, didn't this Court cut it off\nin a different place?\nMR. BUTLER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it did.\nIn fact, for centuries everything this Court did was\nalways retroactive, as the Court knows.\nAnd then we got the Linkletter balancing\ntest, and then later on we got Griffith and Teague, and\nthe Court has refined, usually through the scope of\nFederal habeas corpus --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And during the period\nbetween Linkletter and Griffith, did the State -- if the\nSupreme Court said that a decision was not retroactive,\ndid State supreme courts feel free to apply it\nretroactively?\nMR. BUTLER: It -- there -- there doesn't\nseem to be any case law on that point, Your Honor, that\nI'm aware of. State courts usually, as they do today,\nusually followed this Court's retroactivity decision.\nBut it is unclear whether they thought they had to or\nwhether they just chose to. The question --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can a State -- can\nthey pick -- can a State pick and choose? Can it say\nthat we are going to allow Crawford claims to be applied\nretroactively, but other claims, we're not going to?\nMR. BUTLER: I think, when it -- if you\nconsider, Mr. Chief Justice, that the Teague rule is a\nprocedural rule about who gets to make what claims, then\nI think the answer to your question is yes. The State\ncourt could say --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, and if you\nthink that the Teague rule is an assessment of the\nsubstantive -- part of the substantive constitutional\ninterpretation, an assessment about what the impact of\nCrawford is versus other decisions, then I guess they\ncouldn't, right?\nMR. BUTLER: Well, it depends on the impact\nin what -- in what setting, Your Honor. It -- the --\nthe Teague rule -- and Teague, itself, and every case\nthis Court has ever -- in which this Court has ever\nconsidered Teague, has come from one procedural posture:\nFederal habeas corpus review of State court convictions.\nIt is over that posture that this Court\nexercises both supervisory power and control to\ninterpret the various Federal habeas statutes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, even -- even outside\nof the habeas context, we -- we decided a case, Hudson\nv. Walker, one or two terms ago. It was a no-knock\ncase. We said that, even if there is a no-knock\nviolation, the exclusionary rule does not apply. This\nwould be too costly an extension of the exclusionary\nrule and would bring the -- would make the Fourth\nAmendment a disruptive force.\nUnder your view, I take it, the State, even\nin -- in its trial proceedings subject to direct review,\ncould disagree with that and take a Federal concept,\nno-knock, and then apply the exclusionary rule, thereby\nforcing us to make the -- to draw the very lines that we\nsaid we ought not to draw in Hudson.\nMR. BUTLER: No, Your Honor.\nFirst of all, what Hudson -- the Hudson case\nasked was whether exclusion of evidence was required\nunder the Fourth Amendment when the violation of the\nFourth Amendment was a no-knock violation.\nThe word \"required\" appears throughout the\nopinion in Hudson, and the answer was no, it doesn't.\nThe Fourth Amendment doesn't require exclusion of\nevidence.\nBut there was no suggestion in -- in Hudson\nthat the State court could not then say, here is a\nFourth Amendment violation. We need to come up with\nwhat the remedy is. The Constitution doesn't require us\nto suppress the evidence, so we are -- we either choose\nnot to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but you agree with\nme, then, that under your position, the State could\napply an exclusionary rule.\nMR. BUTLER: Yes, Your Honor, it could under\nState law. And if --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Based on the\ndistinction between right and remedy, a distinction that\nis -- that in countless areas of the law we -- we have\nsaid is -- is an ephemeral one?\nMR. BUTLER: Well, the -- that is not based\non that distinction. That is one way to look at it,\nMr. Chief Justice, that in -- in the Hudson context, it\nis definitely a question of right and remedy.\nThere's no question in Hudson that the\ndefendant's Fourth Amendment rights were violated. The\nquestion is what remedy is required by the Constitution.\nHere, Mr. Danforth wants the Minnesota State\nCourt to consider whether his constitutional rights were\nviolated. It did not hold that they were not. It held\nthat it could not consider the merits of his claim\nbecause of Teague.\nAnd in other settings this Court, in its\nother limitations on the availability of habeas corpus,\nhas described these prudential rules like Teague as\ngateway claims.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Butler, let me -- this\nis a habeas case, but I assume the same issue could come\nup in a -- in a direct appeal to the State Supreme\nCourt. Is it your position that in a direct appeal, the\nState can determine to be retroactive constitutional\nrights that we have said are not retroactive, on direct\nappeal, now, not habeas?\nMR. BUTLER: As long, Justice Scalia, as the\nState acknowledges that it is using State law to do so,\nthat it is -- that it is not mismanaging this Court's\nretroactivity jurisprudence. In other words, as long as\nit doesn't think, well, we -- we must do this.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If it bases its decision on\nthe Federal Constitution, and we have said that this\nFederal constitutional rule is not retroactive, what --\nwhat do they say on a direct appeal?\nMR. BUTLER: On a -- on a direct --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And my next question is\ngoing to be whatever they say, when it comes up to us,\nwhat do we do?\nMR. BUTLER: It would -- it would depend on\nthe facts of the case, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm -- I'm confused on\nthis one, because I thought it was part of our\nretroactivity jurisprudence that the States must apply\nthat new rule while the case is still in the pipeline,\nwhile it is on direct appeal, not that they -- well,\nthey just may, but they absolutely must apply it\nretroactively. I thought that's what Griffith said.\nMR. BUTLER: That is, Your Honor, what\nGriffith says, and that's -- that's what -- that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: My case was not in the\npipeline. The prosecution began after our new decision.\nOkay? And it comes up to the State Supreme Court. Can\nthe State Supreme Court, despite the fact that we've\nsaid the decision is not retroactive, make it\nretroactive? And your answer is yes?\nMR. BUTLER: My answer is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Habeas or not?\nMR. BUTLER: My answer, Your Honor, is that\nif the -- the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If it comes up after --\nif the prosecution is after the Federal decision, of\ncourse, the decision has to apply.\nMR. BUTLER: Yes, I think that's correct,\nJustice Ginsburg. The decision would apply. If the\nprosecution starts after this Court announces a new rule\nand then says that it is not retroactive -- when you\nannounce that it is not retroactive, it is not\nretroactive to cases that are already final.\nIf the case hasn't even begun yet, then, of\ncourse -- then, yes, then the new rule would apply.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does your -- does\nyour approach apply to legislative enactment's as well?\nLet's say Congress passes a law and it provides as\nparticular remedy, and it says this remedy shall not be\nretroactive but only apply in new cases.\nCan the State say well, we think it ought to\napply to old cases, pending cases on habeas, or\nwhatever, and so we are going to apply this\nretroactively, even though Congress said it's only\nprospective?\nMR. BUTLER: I think that's a -- that's a\nsomewhat different question, Your Honor, and it would --\nit would depend on if -- if Congress passed a law that\nsaid no State court shall apply retroactively something\nor other --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. They just\nsay here's a new remedy, maybe a glance and exclusionary\nremedy in cases where we have held one isn't required --\ncan the State allow that retroactively, even though\nCongress -- a Federal remedy, even though Congress has\nsaid this Federal remedy is only prospective?\nMR. BUTLER: In the past, Your -- I think --\nI think the short answer to your question, Mr. Chief\nJustice, is yes. And I think the reason it can is\nbecause, if you look at, for example -- if this is a\nquestion of remedy, then I -- then the State courts have\nall the power to grant more remedies, to grant more\nexpansive --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, your reliance\non this ancient distinction between right and remedy --\nI mean if Congress says you don't have a remedy if it's\nretroactive, it's hard to say what kind of right you\nhave.\nMR. BUTLER: If, Your Honor -- think about\nthe -- the tax cases, for example, American Trucking and\nMcKesson, the case -- the companion case. In both of\nthose cases, especially McKesson, the Court held that\nwhere there has been a violation of somebody's\nconstitutional rights and the -- and the State owes that\nperson some sort of a remedy, then the State can give\nwhatever remedy the minimum requirements of the Federal\nConstitution or Federal law are, but can also go\nfurther.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure, as a matter of\nState law.\nMR. BUTLER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But here you are\narguing in favor of retro-application of Federal law.\nThere is no issue -- as Justice Kennedy pointed out, you\ncan have a State confrontation clause and do whatever\nyou want with it. But you are relying on the Federal\nprovision.\nMR. BUTLER: What -- what we are relying on\n-- we are relying, Mr. Chief Justice, on the substance\nof the Sixth Amendment, yes. That is the substantive\nclaim Mr. Danforth makes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. But you are also\nrelying, as I understand it, on State common law, in\neffect. And you are saying, that so long as the State\ncommon law does not give less by way of remedy and\nrelief than the Federal decision requires, the State is\nfree, as a matter of State remedial common law, to do\nmore. That's your point, isn't it?\nMR. BUTLER: That is absolutely my point,\nJustice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You are saying that,\nultimately, the State's choice in this case rests upon a\nchoice of State common law about procedure leading to\nremedy.\nMR. BUTLER: It is not even just State\ncommon law, Justice Souter. It is state statutory law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. No. I would\nhave thought the very least Teague is, is Federal common\nlawful. In other words, this is the Federal law of\nremedies. I think it is more than that. I think it is\nsubstantive constitutional -- substantive Federal\nconstitutional law. But it's at least Federal common\nlaw, and doesn't Federal common law preempt State common\nlaw.\nMR. BUTLER: Only, Mr. Chief Justice, if the\nFederal interest is so strong as to outweigh all of the\nState court interests. And when it comes to the\nremedial question of does this person have a right to go\nto State court and challenge his conviction, that is\nquintessentially the matter of State law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That always assumes that\nthat's a remedial question, and that the question is not\nwas the Constitution violated at the time this act\noccurred. That -- if that's the question, then you\nacknowledge that the State can't change the situation.\nMR. BUTLER: That's true, Justice Scalia.\nThat if this Court -- if Teague is a rule that says what\nthe Constitution was at a particular time, then it is\nmuch harder for us, we would probably have to make a\nState law claim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you can say -- it\nis a little odd that the State executive can say, yes,\nas far as we're concerned, we like the new law, or what\nwas always the law but the Court wasn't perceptive\nenough to see that, we like it, so we're not going to\nraise Teague. It would be an anomaly, would it not,\nthat the executive of the State is not bound by Teague,\nbut the courts are?\nMR. BUTLER: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. And that's -- the waiver doctrine about\nTeague shows why Teague is not a decision about what the\nlaw was.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that the State\nexecutive can do that with respect to any Federal law\nthat it's authorized to implement, simply choose not to,\ncouldn't it? That's prosecutorial discretion.\nMR. BUTLER: No, Justice Scalia,\nrespectfully, I don't think that's true. If the law at\nthe time of Mr. Danforth's conviction became final said\nthere's no confrontation violation, and we go to State\ncourt or Federal habeas court, for that matter, and the\nState chooses to say we don't want to apply Teague,\nwe'll take him on on his Crawford claim. That, under a\nview that the law has changed, that allows the State\nexecutive branch through waiver or even worse, through\nprocedural default, inaction, to change the substance of\nFederal law.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to write an\nopinion which begins with the sentence, \"This Court has\nno interest in the extent to which its constitutional\ndecisions upset final judgments\"?\nMR. BUTLER: No, Justice Kennedy, I don't\nthink that's what the opinion should start with. I\ndon't necessarily think that that's true. I don't know\nthat there's no interest in much of anything in this\ncase.\nWhen you weigh and balance the interests,\nhowever, the interests of the State courts in\ncontrolling access to their courthouse doors, in\nreviewing that their own judgments -- I mean, Teague\ngets back to a comity decision. Whatever Teague is is\nbased almost not exclusively but primarily on comity and\nrespect for State courts. Federal courts are not --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If Crawford had been a\ndecision of the Minnesota Supreme Court, is it clear\nwhat retroactivity rule they would have applied?\nMR. BUTLER: No, Justice Alito, it's not.\nThe State court has used in the past the Linkletter\nbalancing test. It's also used something akin to\nTeague. And then in this case, they held for Federal\nrules they have to use Teague.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Butler, if as you say\nTeague is, in effect, a comity rule, then what is your\nanswer, in effect, to Justice Scalia's point that we\nmake a decision when we come down with a substantive\nlegal judgment about the Constitution, we make a\ndecision as to whether the rule is retroactive or not?\nAnd he says that if you look at Teague as simply, in\neffect, a comity decision, that's inconsistent with the\ndetermination that we have made, because if you say\nokay, we as a State will apply it earlier than the Feds\nsay we have to, you, in effect, are changing the\nsubstantive determination that we have made, that the\ndecision is not retroactive.\nWhat is the retroactivity analysis that\nunderlies your comity analysis of Teague?\nMR. BUTLER: The retroactivity analysis,\nYour Honor, when this Court makes a decision is that, as\nJustice Ginsburg suggested earlier, Griffith. The Court\nsays when it makes a new rule, when it announces what it\nbelieves to be a new rule, that it knows that it will\napply to a certain group of cases.\nIt doesn't know -- it can't know anything\nmore than that, because the Court doesn't exercise\ncontrol over other courts --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Alright, but let's be more\nspecific. What does it know about retroactive\napplication under Griffith?\nMR. BUTLER: That it will apply.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And it will apply to some\ncases that depend upon facts and have eventuated from\ntrials that are --\nMR. BUTLER: -- that are already finished.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right. So that there's is\ngoing to be some retroactivity?\nMR. BUTLER: Yes, absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if there is going to be\nsome retroactivity, then I take it your position has got\nto be and is our substantive decisions are not so much\nretroactive or non-retroactive, but retroactively\napplied, to some extent, and not retroactively applied\nto others, and a State is free to apply it more\nretroactively than ours. Is that the nutshell?\nMR. BUTLER: That is the gravamen of our\nargument, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So your answer to Justice\nScalia is, I take it, not that the decision is\nretroactive or not, but there is a decision about the\ndegree to which applications will be retroactive or not?\nThat is what underlies your case?\nMR. BUTLER: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then do you think the State\nis free to decide how and when and whether it will,\nquote, apply? I mean, simply to separate the law from\nthe application of the law seems to me no answer at all.\nIs there any other area where you say well,\nyes, there was a Supreme Court decision; but whether to\napply that decision is up to the State?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're overlooking what I\nunderstand to be the basic distinction you're drawing.\nI know the Chief Justice has cast doubt on it. But I\nthink there is a basic distinction between rights and\nremedies.\nAnd you're holding -- I understand your\nposition to be that the remedy may not be retroactive,\neven though the decision itself can assume that there\nwould have been a violation from the beginning of the\nConstitution today we may have misinterpreted before.\nBut if there is a violation of the right, then there's a\ndecision about what kind of remedy shall be imposed.\nAnd you can say we will not impose a remedy\nfor past wrongs, even though we must impose them in the\nfuture and we can let other states decide whether to\npost a remedy or not. And that's totally consistent\nwith the holding that the violation is always\nretroactive, but the remedy may not be.\nMR. BUTLER: I think that's correct, Justice\nStevens. When you talk about remedy --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- it is the other\nway around which makes it problematic. You are going to\nsay the remedy is retroactive even if there's no right.\nYou're going to say where we have decided that there is\nno remedy and, therefore, if you have a right, it's -- I\ndon't know what you get out of it -- you want to say,\nno, there is a remedy.\nMR. BUTLER: What I want to say, Mr. Chief\nJustice, is that if there is a violation of the test of\nthe Sixth Amendment confrontation clause, this Court\ndecides what remedies are required, what remedies for\ncertain people and perhaps for other people what\nremedies are not required. Justice Harlan in Mackey\ncalled it the body responsible for defining the scope of\nthe -- what he called the writ, in other places, the\nadjudicatory process.\nIn this case it's State post-conviction\nreview. It is that body that decides whether there\nshall be either a remedy, you want to call it a remedy\nfor the violation, you want to call it who decides\nwhether the decision shall be applied retroactively, as\nopposed to whether it is retroactive. It is the\ngroup -- it is whoever is controlling the adjudicatory\nprocess.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's subject to the\nfloor, that the floor that this Court sets, it must be\nretroactive to a certain extent.\nMR. BUTLER: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. Subject to the floor, it is then up to the\ngoverning body to decide how much protection to give.\nAnd that gets back to Justice Stevens's point -- the\nStates can always choose to give either -- you can call\nit a greater remedy, you can call it a larger\nretroactive application, as long as the substance of\nFederal law doesn't change, then it is a State question.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It is the same as the\nquestion of whether to apply the exclusionary rule.\nMR. BUTLER: It is.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That was a remedial\ndecision. Everybody agreed the knock and announce\nbusiness was a violation. The only question was on\nremedy. And there are lots of rights that -- for which\nthere's no remedy. Look at all our implied cause of\naction cases, you will find many, many examples of that.\nMR. BUTLER: In habeas corpus as well,\nJustice Stevens. If you file your habeas petition one\nday late, no remedy. If you don't preserve the issue in\nthe trial court, no remedy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you have to\nargue, and this is why I think the distinction has been\nrejected in so many other areas of the law, you have to\nargue that the remedy question is totally separate from\nan analysis of the right. Because otherwise, you are\nsaying the State courts have the right to disagree with\nour determination of what the Federal right is. If you\nthink the remedy, the question of remedy draws some\nsubstance from what the right is, which I would have\nthought is obviously the case, then it seems to me\nyou're asserting a power on the basis of the State court\nto overturn our Federal law determinations.\nMR. BUTLER: We are not asserting, Mr. Chief\nJustice, that the State court has the ability to\ndisagree with this Court's interpretation of the Federal\nConstitution.\nWhat we are asserting is that the State\ncourts and the State legislatures have the ability to\ndecide who can come into State court and what claims the\nState court can listen to.\nAnd I want to -- before I -- my time, I\nwanted to address -- Justice Kennedy had a concern\nearlier about knowing the scope of the application of a\nright when you announce a substantive decision.\nAnd the answer to that, I believe, is that\nthe court -- not only does it already know it's going to\ngo -- it will apply to anything pending on direct\nreview, but that -- that -- that question is much more\ncomplicated than it seems. Different States have\ndifferent time lines for when something is pending on\ndirect review. How long it takes an appeal to pass\nthrough the State court process? What requirements of\nthe defendant are there?\nIn Minnesota it takes about 15 months to run\na direct appeal. And so a defendant can sit there for\n15 months and know that he's probably going to get the\nbenefit of any decision this Court announces. In\nanother State it might take two years. In another State\nit might take six months. There's different groups of\ndefendants -- even under the Griffith standard, we\nalready don't have the sort of uniformity that the\nRespondent thinks is so -- thinks is so important in\nthis area.\nThere's always -- things are always left to\nthe matter of State courts to -- to decide -- to have\ntheir own procedural rules and decide how best to use\ntheir adjudicatory processes, and all this Court can do\nis announce the best Federal rules it thinks the\nConstitution supports, have some idea of what the\nminimum requirements of those rules are going to be; and\nthen it is up to the State courts to decide what other\nremedies to give for the violations that -- if this\nCourt holds something is a violation, then it is up to\nthe State courts to decide as a minimum who it will\napply to.\nIf there are no further questions, I'll\nreserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you -- thank\nyou, Mr. Butler.\nMr. Diamond.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK C. DIAMOND\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DIAMOND: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFederal law controls the retroactivity or\nnon-retroactivity of new constitutional rulings. This\nCourt determines the constitutional requirements --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you, just at the\noutset, when you use the term retroactivity, are you\nsaying there was no violation of the Constitution before\nthe decision, or there just is no remedy for it?\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I think in this --\nthis Court has made it clear in the retroactivity area\nthat retroactivity is a question of the substantive\nconstitutional standard that will applies to a specific\ndefendant. I think the Court's cases from Payne,\nGriffith, Yates --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- one of the cases where\nthe line is drawn when the expiration of the direct\nreview has passed. Is it your view that at that\nparticular point in time a constitutional violation\neither exists or it does not exist? It's not a remedy\nquestion?\nMR. DIAMOND: That's correct, Your Honor. I\ndon't believe this is a matter of remedy. This Court,\nfor example, in Reynoldsville Casket wrote that Teague\nitself is not a limitation on remedy. What it is, is a\nlimitation on the principle of retroactivity itself.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is part of that because of\nwhat's involved in expectations? That's the Smith case,\nwhere we said the determination of whether a\nconstitutional decision is retroactive Is every bit as\nmuch a question of Federal law as the decision of the\nsubstantive right itself. We said that in Smith.\nMR. DIAMOND: Yes, Your Honor, and the point\nis that the substantive rights and retroactivity are not\ntwo different things.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And here the\nexpectation -- in Smith it was the expectation of people\nin the private sector. Here the expectation is one of\nfinality of judgments.\nMR. DIAMOND: Exactly, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then how do you -- how do\nyou reconcile that answer with the point that your\nbrother made just before he sat down, and that is,\ntaking standard Griffith analysis, the application of a\nso-called new rule is going to vary depending on how\nlong it takes a person on direct appeal to get through\nthe State court system?\nAnd it seems to me that that is inconsistent\nwith your view that there has got to be one rule with\nrespect to the date of application as a matter of\nsubstantive Federal law, because we know for a fact\nthat, depending how long it takes to get through the\nState appellate system on direct review, the new rule\nmay be applied and it may not be applied.\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, two points: First\nof all, I think Griffith is very clear, that finality is\nthat point. Griffith is very clear, and it defines\nfinality as that point when the direct appellate process\nhas run, and this Court -- and the opportunity to\npetition this Court for review is over. Secondly, Banks\nII, a retroactivity case from this Court, says that it's\nup to the Federal courts to define finality. Remember\nin Banks II there was a question of whether the\nPennsylvania courts passing on waiver requirements\nsomehow destroyed the finality of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I understand your -- your\npoint about finality, and finality has a well-known\noperative effect. But one operative effect when the\nFederal courts have defined finality and have said it is\nnot final until -- a case is not final until direct\nreview is over -- one consequence of that is that a\nsubstantive Federal rule will be applied to an\nindividual in one State whose crime and whose trial\nprocedure is different in time from that of a defendant\nin another State.\nSo that the consequence is that the\nsubstantive rule will apply to some people who acted on\ndate X and it will not apply to some people who acted on\ndate X; and that, it seems to me, is inconsistent with\nyour answer to Justice Stevens's question.\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, given the varied\nproceedings at the State level, that -- that is\ninevitable no matter what time this Court --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if it is inevitable, I\ndon't see how you can answer Justice Stevens's question\nthe way you did.\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, the point in\nGriffith is that in terms of uniformity, this is -- in\nterms of providing similarly situated people, the best\nthe Court can do in this area is to cut -- to make the\npoint at finality --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the finality point in\neffect establishes a way of calculating the application\nof a rule in any given State in any given case, but it\nwill not result in the uniform application of the rule.\nIsn't that correct?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, that's correct. You\nhave to say that's correct.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DIAMOND: And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I think you can also\nexplain that the reason it's correct is the Court\nprobably would have liked to say yes, we're making up a\nnew rule; the Constitution didn't use to say this; and\nthis rule will apply from now on to all actions taken by\nindividuals from now on. But then, you know, Justice\nHarlan says my goodness, you're going to give relief to\nthis individual and not give relief to other individuals\nwho are making the same claim and already have cases\npending? You have to treat them equally. So we will\nmake an equitable exception for that.\nBut basically, the existence of that\nexception does not prove that the Court was not\npurporting to make a substantive rule. There's an\nexception to the application of that substantive rule\nfor pending cases, which is totally understandable.\nMR. DIAMOND: Which, Your Honor, is Griffith\nand is defined by Federal law.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can you give me an example\nof a case in which this Court candidly said, we're\nannouncing a new rule which was not the law before?\nAren't we always interpreting what we thought the intent\nof the framers was from the beginning, even though we\nmay have gotten it before? What is your best example of\na new rule, in the sense it's a different rule of law as\nopposed to a different remedy? See, all these equitable\nconsiderations go to the remedy. But the notion we can\nmake up a new rule of law at will strikes me as a very\ndramatic departure from what I understand the rule of\nlaw to require.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm really glad to hear\nthat.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I think the\npoint -- this isn't Blackstone -- Blackstone is not the\nonly view here. The point is that finality is -- is not\na competing concern, but the point --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Finality is a condition\nfor fashioning the right remedy. There's no doubt.\nEverything you say is necessary for treating litigants\nin a -- in a fair manner. But that all goes to remedy,\nnot to the violation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't we call it a new\nrule in Teague?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- expectations as being\nquestions of remedy?\nMR. DIAMOND: Excuse me, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that your\n-- your answer to Justice Souter's question earlier\nshould be that there is uniformity. Some States are\nfast, some are slow, but in the end there is a final\njudgment which is a settled expectation, and the\nsubstance of the law honors settled expectations, which\nis finality.\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor -- and that point\nis -- the point of finality is a recognized point of\nwhat is necessary for the integrity of judicial\ndecision-making.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's sort of like\ndefining order as random order, isn't it?\nMR. DIAMOND: I disagree, Your Honor. I\nthink that as Justice Harlan said in the -- in the\nWilliams and Mackey dissents, there is -- a decision\nthat is always subject to revision is really the\nfunctional equivalent of no decision at all. It's what\nmakes judicial decisions judicial.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and the concern is a\nconcern not so much.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the concern is not so\nmuch a concern not so much for the defendant here but\nfor the States, isn't it? We don't want -- we think\nthere is -- there is an important value implicit in\nhabeas, and one of those values is that there be a limit\nto the degree to which we are going to upset the settled\nexpectations of the States. Isn't that right?\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, the State's\ninterest here can be vindicated by the State by applying\nState law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not the point. I\nthought that Teague was driven not by some abstract\nnotion about finality, but the intrusion on State\ndecision-making. Here was State that had conducted an\nentire process that appeared to be in line with what the\nFederal law then appeared to be. And then the State is\ntold by some Federal habeas court, State, you've got to\ndo it all over again, because you didn't -- you didn't\npredict that we were going to interpret the Constitution\ndifferently. I thought that the really motivating idea\nof Teague was it addressed the Federal forum and said,\nFederal forum, don't step on the States' toes, don't\nmake them redo trials that have long since been over.\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I'm here\nrepresenting the State of Minnesota, and the intrusion\nthat I'm concerned about in this case is a State court\njudge adopting some Federal optional -- sort of Federal\nrequirement, and applying it as opposed to using State\nlaw that can be reviewed and overturned and for which\nthat State court judge is accountable to the citizenry\nof the State.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I must say I have\nserious problems with your position in that regard.\nIf you were not to prevail in this case\nand -- or, pardon me, if the Petitioner were to prevail\nin this case, and there were a ruling on what Crawford\nmeans, or doesn't mean, we could review it. I think the\nPetitioner is absolutely right on that point.\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I think that it's\ndifficult. If you look at, for example, the recent case\nin Minnesota, Krasky, dealing with essentially the same\nevidence that's at issue in this case, if the State was\nadopting Krasky as some State standard, then this Court\nwouldn't be in a position to review it. If it's\nadopting Krasky as a -- as the Federal standard, then\nthe question is, how is it that the State is adopting\nsomething as a matter of the Federal Constitution that\nis not a Federal constitutional requirement?\nJUSTICE BREYER: The question I have is, to\ngo back, you said two separate things. One is you say\nthe question here is a matter of Federal law. I'll give\nyou that. It's a matter of Federal law.\nBut the question is, what's the content of\nthe Federal law? Does the Federal law say to the States\n-- State, in a collateral review proceeding, you want to\napply Crawford retroactively to people whose convictions\nwere long ago, do it, we don't care?\nAnd a lot of Teague says that should be the\nFederal rule, if it's called a Federal rule.\nBut then you said a different thing, in\nanswer to Justice Stevens. The different thing was but\nthe substantive rule of Crawford only takes effect as of\nthe day of Crawford and into the future.\nNow, on that position, or take any other\ndate you want as one year earlier or whatever you're\ngoing to pick there, if you're right about that, you\nwin.\nBut how could you be right about what I call\nthere a metaphysical point? Because on the metaphysics,\nas Justice Souter just pointed out, imagine three people\nwho have three identical trials each one year before\nCrawford. The first person is called Crawford, and he\nwins.\nThe second person is called Smith, and he's\ndelayed forever in the appeals process.\nAnd the third person is called Jones, and he\nget a quick appeal, convicted, in jail at the time of\nCrawford.\nNow we know that the first two Crawford\napplies to, but metaphysically, if the law of Crawford\nwas the law at the time of the first two trials, why\nwasn't it the law in terms of what the rights are in\nrespect to the third person whose trial was held at\nprecisely the same time?\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, the point I think\nis that this is a point that Griffith makes, that when\nyour conviction becomes final, that your stake -- if I\ncan call it that -- in changes in the law come to a\nclose.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I agree with that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You are saying\nmetaphysically this Court has no power to enunciate new\nconstitutional rules metaphysically, but we have done\nso, and Teague is full of references to new rules. \"We\ntherefore hold that implicit in the retroactivity\napproach we adopt today is the principle that habeas\ncorpus cannot be used as vehicle to create new\nconstitutional rules of criminal procedure unless those\nrules would be applied retroactively to all defendants.\"\nThe opinion is full of new rules.\nSo -- so, you know, we have violated\nmetaphysics already. Having violated it, in adopting\nnew constitutional rules, why should it be any surprise\nthat we also violated it in the application of those\nrules? There should be no surprise at all. Don't get\nhung up on metaphysics, Mr. Turner.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In Crawford itself, it\nseems there was quite a bit of attention given to\nhistory long before the original interpretation of the\nclause. I guess that was unnecessary because we were\nmaking up new rules. Is that the --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: You've adopted Justice\nScalia's approach through your silence, and I'd ask you\nwhether -- whether -- whether there isn't just a simpler\nexplanation that doesn't require us to go into Spinonza,\nImmanuel Kant, or even Aristotle. And the simpler\nexplanation would be simply what Justice Stevens started\nwith, that Teague is about remedies, and that we assume\nthat the law was the law at the time of Crawford's\ntrial, at the time of Smith's trial, and at the time of\nJones' trial.\nBut Jones is knocked out because he went to\nhabeas. And that's what Teague is about. Habeas. And,\ntherefore, if the State wants to apply Crawford\nretroactively, let everybody out of jail, that's their\nproblem. Or their virtue. That's up to them.\nThat's where Justice Stevens started, and\nthat's what I would like to hear an answer to.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You wouldn't want to say\nthat, Mr. Turner, because that would place you in the\nposition of saying what we are telling people in these\nTeague cases is oh, yes, the Constitution was violated,\nbut we don't want to hear about it. I mean that's the\nalternative, to acknowledge that the Constitution is\nviolated in all of these Teague cases, some of them\nbeing capital cases, and we nonetheless say well, too\nbad, it's on habeas.\nI'd like to think that's not what we're\ndoing, that what we're saying is, this is a new\nconstitutional rule, there was no constitutional\nviolation before, and that's why we're letting it stand.\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think you're\nhandling these questions very well.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was not a question\naddressed to you, Mr. Diamond.\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I think that, in\nterms of Teague as a remedial limitation, first of all,\nI don't think this Court's retroactivity jurisprudence\nat all supports that notion.\nI also think, for example, while certainly\nnot directly at issue in the habeas area, in construing\nhabeas, this Court said that Teague was not so much\nabout a standard of review as it was about the standard\nthat applies itself. And so I think it's very difficult\nto square the notion of Teague as a remedial limitation\nwith this Court's retroactivity jurisprudence.\nIt's also difficult to square it with the\nexplicit rejection of that notion in American Trucking\nand in Harper and Reynoldsville Casket.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You do recognize, though,\nthat one of the propelling forces behind Teague and why\nwe changed from the Linkletter regime was respect for\nState courts' processes and the resistance to the heavy\nhand of Federal habeas courts telling States what to do.\nIt seems a little ironic then if you take an\nopinion that was driven by the Feds staying out of the\nState courts' territory to say oh, no, we're going to\ntell you that it's not -- we control when we want to.\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, certainly that was\none of the things that was going on in Teague. But,\nrespectfully, I think the question -- it's every bit as\nintrusive on the State process when a State court judge\napplies a new Federal rule to overturn a conviction, as\nit is when a Federal court judge does the same thing.\nIn other words, those comity concerns apply\nregardless of forum.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't what you are saying\nis that the concern in Teague was not only with State\ncourt processes, but with settled expectations of those\nwho are involved in the criminal system, particularly\nvictims who are entitled at some point to rely on a\nconviction being final?\nMR. DIAMOND: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We don't usually think of\njust of settled expectations as being questions of\nremedy. We consider those as being questions of\nsubstance.\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I think if you\nlook at Justice Harlan's writing in Teague about the\npost-conviction -- what should be the rule for\npost-conviction, you see he lays out very eloquently\nwhat those concerns are in terms of finality and\nuniformity in the post-conviction arena. And what I'm\nsaying is that those concerns -- certainly comity is a\nconcern; but those other concerns in terms of finality\nand allocation of judicial scarce criminal justice\nresources and what kind of a trial are you going to have\n11 years after the fact, is it going to be more fair\nthan the trial that occurred in the first place, all of\nthose -- apply.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- State executives can\nupset all those expectations. The State executive says\nI want this -- the issue -- the substantive issue in\nthis case settled, so I'm not going to raise Teague.\nAnd so Crawford is going to be retroactive because I say\nso. It is a bit of an anomaly that the prosecutor has\nthat power but not the State court itself.\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, first of all, I\nthink the State court is in a business -- is in a\ndifferent role in terms of enforcing the constitutional\nrights in that situation. In fact, as it relates to the\nconstitutional right, it is difficult to see what State\ninterest a judge should be vindicating at that point.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It is also difficult to\nsee what Federal interest is vindicated when the State\nsays we know we have to respect this -- call it what you\nwant -- new precedent in cases still in the pipeline,\nand we don't have to if the case has reached a final\njudgment. But \"not required to\" doesn't say \"can't,\neven if you want to.\"\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, that brings me\nback to the point where I started, which is that the\nConstitution doesn't -- remember, we're using the\nFederal Constitution here as authority to do something\nthat, for example, in this case the Minnesota Court\nwould be otherwise unable to do.\nThis defendant never raised the State law\nclaim. Under -- never had -- this defendant never\nraised his State confrontation rights. So in this\nproceeding, the Minnesota Court would bar him from\nraising his confrontation --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let me take the other point\nhere, which is Justice Scalia's, which I think I\nunderstand now. Imagine that the Crawford begins to\ntake effect as of the day of decision. No law like\nCrawford before. But for practical reasons and reasons\nhaving to do with courts, we let certain people take\nadvantage of it. We let person A take advantage of it,\nMr. Crawford. We let person B take advantage of it, who\nis on direct appeal. We don't let people in habeas take\nadvantage of it.\nWhy don't we let the State take advantage of\nit in its collateral proceedings if the State wants to,\nfor reasons of federalism, for reasons they can do what\nthey want, for reasons if it is going to be the law in\nthe future any way?\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, my point is that\nthe State can take -- the State can do that as a matter\nof State law. The problem is with allowing the State to\nextend the Federal standards here, is that the Federal\nstandards under Teague and under Griffith, but mainly\nGriffith and Wharton together in this case, defines what\nthe constitutional requirement -- what constitutional\nstandard this --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask another sort of\nbasic question? The Teague rule is a Federal rule --\nthe Teague ruling. What is your understanding of the\nsource of that rule? Is it the Court's power to\nannounce, make Federal common law? Or is it a\nconstitutionally mandated rule?\nI will give you one other decision, cover it\nall at once.\nAnd if it were not a judge-made rule, and\nrather, it was a statute and it goes beyond regulating\nFederal habeas corpus proceedings and effects State\ncourt proceedings, what provision in the Constitution\nwould have given Congress the authority to enact such a\nstatute?\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, let me --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Interpreting it the way\nyou interpret it.\nMR. DIAMOND: Let me try the first question,\nand then we will see where we go. I think the source\nof -- the authority for Teague is, frankly, the same\nsource for authority as it is for Griffith, and as the\nsame source of authority as in Griffith. Griffith talks\nabout -- the best I can do for that is Griffith talks\nabout it being grounded on basic norms of constitutional\nadjudication and the integrity of the judicial decision\nmaking.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which qualifies for the\nFederal system. Where is the authority to regulate the\nState system come from?\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I disagree in\nterms of that that all applies only in the Federal\nsystem. If you look at, for example, the civil cases,\nAmerican Trucking, Reynoldsville, and Harper, they\ntalked about that same basic norms of constitutional\nadjudication applying in the State forum as well.\nI'm sorry. There was a second part to your\nquestion which was in terms of Congress being able to\namend or modify Teague in some fashion?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. Where would Congress\nget the authority to require State courts to follow the\nrule, the interpretation of Teague that you're advancing\nin this Court, that they may not go beyond the decisions\nof this Court? What under the Federal Constitution\nauthorizes the Federal government, either judges or\nCongress, to tell State courts that they cannot do what\nyour opponent argues they should able to do?\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I don't believe\nthat that's what's going on in the Federal habeas\nstatute. I think this Court has said that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I agree when you are\ntalking about what Federal court can do -- administering\na Federal habeas corpus. I have no problem. I'm asking\nwhere does the Federal authority to tell State courts\nthey cannot do what your opponent says they should be\nfree to do?\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I guess my source\nof confusion with your question is I don't understand\nTeague is a rule from Congress. I understand Teague is\na rule of this Court in terms -- describing what the\nConstitution -- what constitutional standard applies to\nwhat defendant.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In Federal habeas corpus\nproceedings, yes.\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, that's where the\npoint of agreement is. I think Teague does many things,\nbut one of the things Teague does -- and, frankly, not\njust Teague, the whole retroactivity jurisprudence of\nthis Court, Griffith and Teague together set up a\ncoherent whole. Griffith treats finality. Teague\npost-finality. And the process of this Court saying,\nyou this defendant enjoy this substantive Federal right,\nyou this defendant enjoy this substantive Federal right\nthat was active at the time your conviction became\nfinal --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The protection of this\nCourt. What -- why can't they provide more protection?\nWhat Federal rule prevents that?\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I think what --\nthe problem with it is in the constitutional design\nitself. In terms of the Constitution provides\nrequirements. You don't have to get into Teague.\nGriffith and Wharton together, Wharton saying Teague\nexceptions don't apply to Crawford, those two cases\ntogether basically say the State's requirement to\nprovide this new constitutional rule ended when this\ndefendant's conviction became final.\nAt that point, that is the constitutional\nrequirement. The constitutional design then is that\nStates are not free as a matter of Federal authority to\nexceed that requirement. They may not rely on Federal\nauthority to do that. Just the same -- they can\ncertainly do it as a matter of their own authority. But\nthe Constitution, for example, this defendant having\nwaived his State claims, having not raised them, the\nConstitution doesn't allow the State of Minnesota --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Suppose it is a knock and\nannounce violation. They don't want to apply an\nexclusionary rule. Can they apply a remedy that will\nfire any officer who does this? Or will they say, no,\nyou can't do that, because it goes beyond what the\nFederal Constitution requires?\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I think that if\nthat remedy is grounded in State laws, the State of\nMinnesota could certainly do that. But I don't think\nthey can rely on the Federal Constitution to fire any\nofficer who does that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could a -- could a State\nsay: We know that Federal habeas, the Fourth Amendment,\nis out. Stone v. Powell says when it's -- when you\ngo through the direct process, that's the end of your\nraising a search-and-seizure claim.\nCould a State say: Well, we know the Fourth\nAmendment is binding on us under the Federal\nConstitution, but we think that we should extend the\nFourth Amendment, right, not only to cases on direct\nreview but to collateral review as well?\nFederal habeas courts can't do it, but could\nStates?\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I think the answer\nto that is probably yes, and the reason is different,\nthough. The reason is the States -- we're not changing\nthe rights that the person is entitled to.\nWhat we are -- what you're changing -- that\nis -- that is the remedy-and-right question again. And\n-- and what I'm saying is that what Teague -- Griffith\nand Lorton together say that this person's\nconstitutional right, the right that he had, was fixed\nwhen his conviction became final, as opposed to the case\nwhere you -- that you're postulating, which is the\nquestion of, yes, the State's going to recognize the\nFourth Amendment right in its post-conviction -- does\nthe right -- the content of the right, itself, is not\nchanged in that instance.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Diamond, let me ask you\na question. Let me ask you a question which is totally\noff the point of the Federal Constitution, I guess.\nThat is, if Minnesota really wants the rule that you\nwant it to have, its legislature can provide that that\nwill be the rule, can't it?\nThe Minnesota legislature can pass a statute\nsaying nobody gets more than Teague allows.\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I don't think the\nMinnesota legislature could -- could go into the\npre-finality area. In other words, the Minnesota\nlegislature --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Can the Minnesota\nlegislature say: Look, the -- the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States has -- has come down with some rules. We\nwon't characterize them as minimums or anything else.\nWe'll just say it's a set of rules. It's called Teague,\nand Teague is going to be the law for the application of\nFederal rights in Minnesota State courts. Is -- can the\nMinnesota legislature do that?\nMR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I think, in that\ninstance, the Minnesota legislature -- I see my time is\nup, but I think in that instance the Minnesota\nlegislature is -- is providing the minimum that the\nConstitution requires. So the answer to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So the answer is yes.\nMR. DIAMOND: -- that is yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Diamond.\nMr. Butler, you have a minute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. BUTLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BUTLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nTwo quick points in my -- in my one minute:\nOn finality, the State court can weigh the\ncosts and benefits of upsetting the finality of its own\nconviction, convictions rendered in State court and\nappeals rendered in State court.\nIt can decide, as several States have, that\nthe interests in full adjudication of constitutional\nclaims outweigh the interest in finality.\nThe question in Teague was whether the\nFederal court could decide that for the States, and the\nanswer is no. But the States can decide that for\nthemselves.\nOn Justice Souter's point about what -- or\nsomebody's point about what the source of authority was,\nMr. Diamond said it was basic norms of constitutional\nadjudication, and that is the phrase used in Griffith.\nThat phrase is a minimum. The basic norms\nof constitutional adjudication require the following:\nThey require application of new rules to pending cases,\neven though the conduct had already -- had already\nhappened.\nThey don't require anything more than that,\nand we're not here asking the Court to hold that they\ndo. We're simply asking the Court -- I see my time is\nup.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you finish\nyour sentence.\nMR. BUTLER: We are simply asking the Court\nto hold that if the State wishes to go beyond the\nminimum, they are free to do so.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Butler.\n"
