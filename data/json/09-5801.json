        "content": "(11:06 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument next this morning in Case 09-5801,\nFlores-Villar v. United States.\nMr. Hubachek.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN F. HUBACHEK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HUBACHEK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn Nguyen, the Court approved the imposition\nof legitimation requirement only upon fathers of\nnon-marital children born abroad. That was based on\nbiological differences between men and women. It\nprovided proof of parentage and proof of an opportunity\nto make a relationship with the child that adhered in\nbirth as to the mother.\nBut here, the residential requirements that\nare at issue here have no biological basis. They set up\nbarriers to the transmission of citizenship by younger\nfathers, but not younger mothers, and they are based\nupon gender stereotypes that women, not men, would\ncare -- would care for non-marital children.\nThat scheme has been -- the Solicitor\nGeneral has attempted to justify that scheme by claiming\nthat Congress was concerned about statelessness, but the\nrecord doesn't support that claim. Both the 1935 Law\nReview article -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What separates a stereotype\nfrom a reality? Do you say it is not true that if there\nis a legitimate -- illegitimate child, it is much more\nlikely that the woman will end up caring for it than\nthat the father would?\nMR. HUBACHEK: What I was saying -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not true?\nMR. HUBACHEK: I think it is more likely,\nbut I think that empirical evidence has not carried the\nday in gender discrimination cases.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In all cases, it is true\nin general, but there are people who don't fit the mold.\nSo a stereotype is true for maybe the majority of cases.\nIt just means that you say: This is the way women are,\nthis is the way men are.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Absolutely, and this is\nactually beyond just an empirical stereotype. The -- at\ncongressional hearings, it was said that the woman is\nthe sole legal parent of this child, totally excluding\nthe man, which basically dates back to the notion of\ncoverture where men were completely out of the picture\nand women were the ones who were responsible.\nSo in addition to the fact that -- the\nempirical portion of it, there is also just the notion\nthat the legal parent was the woman. And that was\nspecifically -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Wasn't that said in relation\nto the principle that only -- that where paternity was\nnot established, the child would be regarded as having\nthe citizenship of the mother under the law of virtually\nevery country, if not every country, at that time?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, the law of many\ncountries was that citizenship did go through the\nmother. But with respect to legitimation and this\nstatute, Congress drew a distinction between all -- all\nparents of -- excuse me, all fathers of non-marital\nchildren and those who are legitimate. This statute\napplies only to those who are legitimate.\nThe very Law Review article that Congress\nrelied upon, according to the Solicitor General, says\nthat in the case of legitimation, citizenship goes\nthrough the father. So the bottom line is that the\nvery -- the very article they relied upon said that in\none instance it goes through the mother, but in the\ninstance of the people who are actually affected through\nthis statute, those who legitimate, it goes through the\nfather.\nAnd there are also a number of situations\nunder which mothers -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Until there is legitimation,\nit goes through the mother. It went through the mother\nunder the law in virtually every country, right?\nMR. HUBACHEK: I respectfully disagree. At\nthe time, in 1940, when this statute was passed, there\nwere a number of situations where it wouldn't go through\nthe mother. In China and Japan, if the father was\nmerely known it would not go through the mother.\nThere were three dozen countries at this\ntime, including the English countries and those who\nfollowed its law, in which if their female citizen gave\nbirth to a child somewhere other than in their country,\ncitizenship would not travel through that mother because\nof the laws of those particular countries. There are\nalso stateless women.\nSo in all those situations, the citizenship\nwould not go through the mother. It would have to go\nthrough the father, and this statutory scheme doesn't in\nany way provide for that.\nThe scheme also creates severe risks of\nstatelessness, as is set out in the Statelessness\nScholar's brief, for married fathers. If a married\nfather who is married to an alien, the -- in those\nsituations, there are a number of countries that would\nnot allow the woman to transmit citizenship. So if the\nfather was precluded by laws such as they were in the\nUnited States, that child would end up stateless as\nwell. So there is substantial risk of statelessness and\nit continues today.\nThere are numerous countries that have\nbasically reinstituted that rule, that if the father is\nmerely known, citizenship would not transmit through the\nmother. And those are primarily in the Middle East and\nsome of them in Africa, and those are detailed in the\nStatelessness Scholars' brief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hubachek, how do you\ndeal with the argument that, really, this is a\nclassification where the unmarried woman is being\nfavored, because the unmarried father is being bracketed\nwith the married couple? So it's kind of like\nMatthews v. Heckler: The woman is getting a special\nfavor and the unwed father is treated like most people\nwho married -- couples who have children.\nMR. HUBACHEK: This is not a case where\nCongress was seeking to remedy any sort of past\ndiscrimination against women, as was the case, say, in\nSchlesinger v. Ballard. There was no discrimination\nagainst women. Up until very shortly before this\nstatute was passed, it was clear under the State\nDepartment practices that the non-marital children of\nwomen did get women's citizenship, and it was also true\nas to men. So there was no discrimination that was\nbeing remedied in that situation.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that doesn't answer,\nI don't think, Justice Ginsberg's question, which is:\nThis appears to be an exception to a generalized\nnon-gender based requirement. Couples, male or female,\nand fathers, unmarried fathers, are subject to five\nyears. Only unmarried mothers get the largesse of one\nyear. Why isn't -- why shouldn't everybody just be put\nto the broader category rather than extending a largesse\nto a greater number of people?\nMR. HUBACHEK: The reason is, Justice\nSotomayor, is that we are not talking about an exception\nhere, the treatment that the non-marital mothers were\ngetting. That was the standard prior to the 1940\nlitigation -- 1940 legislation. There was no\nsignificance residence requirement.\nThen Congress imposed new residence\nrequirements because it was concerned about the foreign\ninfluence in mixed marriages, meaning someone who was\nmarried to an alien. In those situations, Congress\nspecifically said in the record that they were concerned\nthat when those children were born abroad, that they\nwould have foreign influence, that they would be more\nforeign then they were American. That's not -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So doesn't the 5-year\nresidency requirement address that? If we apply it\ngenerally, wouldn't the 5-year residency requirement\nhonor Congress's concern about there being a substantial\ntie to the States?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Absolutely, it would. And\nthat -- for -- that concern is not applicable when you\nare talking about two U.S. citizen parents to whom the\nextended residence requirement didn't apply.\nNon-marital mothers were assumed to be the ones who were\ngoing to be raising the children without the influence\nof an alien father.\nThe non-marital fathers are in the same\ncategory as those, too. Those non-marital fathers who\nraise their children on their own, as Petitioner's\nfather did in this case, are not subject to that type of\nforeign influence, so they should be grouped together\nwith the women and with the two-citizen families,\nbecause they have the lack of foreign influence.\nSo it's only as to the mixed-marriage\ncouples who are married where there is a foreign\ninfluence problem, and they're the ones to whom the\nexpanded residence required -- was applied.\nNow, with respect to the -- the Solicitor\nGeneral has raised concerns about the plenary power\ndoctrine. And I would argue that that doesn't apply\nhere for a couple of reasons.\nFirst is, we are not talking about the\nadmission of aliens.\nSecond is that the Court in Chadha Zadvydas\nsaid -- made clear that even when exercising that power,\nthat congressional -- excuse me -- Congress's power is\nlimited by constitutional limitations.\nNow, with respect to the entry of aliens,\nCongress made it very clear in passing this very statute\nthat they considered those people who gained citizenship\nas of birth to be differently situated than aliens.\nThat was a tradition that dated back to 1350. In 1790,\nCongress passed a statute saying that children born\nabroad to citizens -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is this your -- are\nyou taking this in the direction of an argument that\nCongress gets less deference in determining nationality\nthan it does with admission to aliens?\nMR. HUBACHEK: What I'm saying, Your Honor,\nis that we are talking about the ability of a United\nStates citizen, Petitioner's father, to transmit\ncitizenship, and that that is a traditional interest.\nCitizenship is extremely important and it's a tradition\nthat citizens have been able to do for years.\nSo yes, constitutional limitations should\napply when the -- when Congress is drawing distinctions\nbetween men and women -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you -- you want us to\nwrite an opinion that says Congress has less deference\nwhen it considering -- when it determines who should be\na national of this country than it -- than when it\ndetermines who should be admitted as an alien?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, there is no tradition\ndating back to 1350 for the admission of aliens.\nIt's -- it's -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you asking us to write\nthat formulation in an opinion?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Your Honor, what I'm saying\nis that the -- that the due process guarantee of equal\nprotection is applicable in this context because the\ncitizens of the United States -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If I -- if I take that as\na \"yes\" answer, what is your authority for that answer?\nIt seems to me that it ought to be just the other way\naround.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, Your Honor, my\nauthority for that answer is the tradition that I have\nbeen discussing. Congress itself, in 1940, considered\npeople who gained citizenship by birth abroad as being\ndifferently situated from aliens, aliens who naturalize.\nIn fact, they said that that was universally -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, but it was\nCongress that made the distinction. But you are asking\nus to say that Congress has less authority over this\nessential issue as to who should be nationals in the\nUnited States.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think -- that's -\nthat's a -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Maybe there is some\nauthority for that. Do you have any authority? Is\nthere something I can read that tells me that?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Chadha Zadvydas says that\neven though Congress has plenary power over the\nimmigration power. When it exercises that power, it has\nto apply with constitutional limitations. This is the\nfirst one of the Court's cases where -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That was an alien\nadmissions case. You are talking about nationality.\nMR. HUBACHEK: I'm talking about citizenship\nbeing transmitted by a United States citizen. What we\nare saying is that Petitioner's father, as a United\nStates citizen, has equal protection -- Equal Protection\nClause, protection against the discrimination, here\nbecause a similarly-situated woman would be able to\ntransmit citizenship.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well -- I'm sorry. Go\nahead. Finish.\nAre you finished?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't quite follow this.\nAs I understand it, on what -- say: On what remedy will\nthere be if you're right? This is what I don't\nunderstand.\nA child is born abroad. One parent is\nAmerican; the other is foreign. If the two are married,\nthat child is American only if the father or the\nmother -- one or the other -- has lived in the United\nStates for now at least 2 years. It used to be more.\nOkay? Now it's 5 years after the age of 16.\nNow suppose they are not married, and\nsuppose the American is the father. Same rule.\nNow suppose they are not married and the\nAmerican is the mother. Now it's not 5 years or 2\nyears; you only have to have lived here for one year.\nSuppose I agree with you. I just don't see any sense to\nthat whatsoever. I can't figure it out. They made a\nmistake about the immigration laws. Suppose I agree\nwith you.\nThen why isn't the remedy, say: Okay,\nwhether it is the father or the mother, the general rule\napplies. They have to have lived in the United States\nfor 5 years or for 2 years? Now 2 years.\nMR. HUBACHEK: There are a couple of reasons\nat least for that, Your Honor. First is that there is a\nstructural limitation here to imposing a levelling-down\ntype remedy, because citizenship cannot be taken away\nonce it's granted. So the Court can't remedy the\nproblem here -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Some people were lucky, and\nthey are already citizens under this, and there we are,\nbecause their mother lived in the United States for one\nyear. Those already are citizens. Nobody is going to\ntake that away. We are just looking at a statute.\nAnd in the first part of the statute, they\nhave in section (g) of 1401, the first rule I told you\nabout. In 1409(a), the second rule, and in 1409(c), the\nthird rule.\nOkay. If you are right about this, and it's\ntotally unfair and there is no good reason whatsoever\nfor distinguishing on the basis of gender, we strike\n(g). Okay?\nNow, that would seem to be normal, but that\nisn't going to help your client. So how do you get to\nsome other thing that instead of striking (g)? What we\ndo is strike all of (a) and strike the whole thing\nbefore, and shove them all into (g), which isn't so easy\nto do with this language. How do you get there?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, the first thing is, is\nthat this statute contains a severability clause. Very\nsimilar to -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. So we strike (g).\nWhat I'm worried about is, you want me to strike (a) -\nsorry, we strike (c). And you want me to strike 1409(a)\nand 1401(g), and shove the people who are there into\n(g), which is a little tough to do in the English\nlanguage. But I want to know how you get there.\nMR. HUBACHEK: By -- by extension, Your\nHonor. And -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: First, can we be clear\nabout what you're saying? I thought your argument was,\nyou are not touching married couples.\nMR. HUBACHEK: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that you are talking\nabout equating the unmarried father to the unmarried\nmother. Do you have -- is there any notion of how many\npeople we're talking about?\nI mean, in these extensions versus the\nnormalization, where the Court generally extends when\nthere is a small class to be covered, a small class was\nleft out, and in a large class is already covered. And\nthe reasoning has been: Well, my goodness, Congress\nwanted to take care of that larger class; it would be\nmost destructive of the legislative will if we said you\ncan't cover that larger class.\nSo as a group of unmarried mothers as\nagainst unmarried fathers, do -- do you have any notion\nof what the numbers would be?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Justice Ginsberg, I don't\nhave any statistics to provide the Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe this is -\nmaybe you would like to answer Justice Breyer's\nquestion.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Yes, Justice Breyer. Anyway,\nthe remedy we are requesting is extension. In Westcott\nand in Heckler, the Court looked at language in the\nseverability clause that was similar to this, and also\nin Justice Harlan's concurring opinion in Welsh, and\nsaid that type of language in a severability clause\ngives courts power to grant an extension remedy.\nSo that's what we are requesting. We're\nrequesting -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, there's another slight\nproblem with that, I would think. Reading this\ncarefully, which I hope I have done, it seems to me it\nmay also discriminate against fathers. And that's\nbecause (c) says that the woman has to have been\nphysically present for a continuous period of one year.\nI read at least one article that says that word,\n\"continuous,\" doesn't appear with the fathers, and that\nthey really mean it. That is, if somebody is living\ndown in Texas and they happen to go visit on Christmas\ntheir father, who is -- or their grandmother or cousin\nor something who is across the border for 5 minutes,\nthat they cannot take advantage of this clause (c).\nIs that true?\nMR. HUBACHEK: I don't know the answer to\nthat, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I will ask the (g) that,\nbut if it is true -- if it is true, then -- then I would\nthink that the fathers are really worse off. I don't\nknow if that helps you. And maybe it could turn out\nthat that's really a problem.\nIf it is really a problem, then the fathers\nare worse off. Does that help you with the remedy?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Traditionally in immigration\nlaw when you have continuous requirements, if it's a\nshort trip, casual trip, you know, then those -- that\nrequirement is not considered to have been violated.\nIf the -- if -- I have to admit I'm having a\nhard time following the question.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The question is: I'm\nlooking for a way -- I'm trying to be helpful in my\nquestion. I'm looking for a way that you can get to\nyour result. Now I'm not saying I would do it, but I\njust want to know what the best way is of getting to\nthat result, where you shove everyone into (c) instead\nof just cutting (c).\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, the -- the best way is\nto follow the Court's tradition in the benefits cases\nsuch as Wengler and Wiesenfeld, where the Court granted\nan extension remedy and basically treated -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That would help you. Is\nthere a reason for doing that?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, the reason for doing\nthat is, is that the language that's contained in the\nseverability clause is similar to what the Court has\nalready said allows an extension remedy. And the other\nproblem is, is that if the Court doesn't grant an\nextension remedy, it leaves Petitioner basically without\na remedy, that there will be individuals who have been\nable to have a -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, he would have a\nremedy. The remedy for an equal protection violation is\nto treat everybody the same. You can do that either by\nlowering the people who are given a benefit or by\nincreasing the people who aren't. So he has a remedy.\nHis objection is, we're not being -- my\nfather and my mother are not being treated the same.\nThat's all of the relief he is entitled to.\nMR. HUBACHEK: You are absolutely right,\nthat that is -- that is the state of the law. And my\npoint is that structurally, that remedy is unavailable\nhere, because you can't take away the citizenship from\nthe people who have already gotten it.\nAnd the notion that you can grant us\nprospective relief as discussed in the Solicitor\nGeneral's brief doesn't make any sense, either, because\nnumber one, this statute, the one we are talking about\ntoday, doesn't apply past people who were born before\n1986.\nBut the thing is that if somebody were to\ncome into court after an opinion that said just that\nwere issued -- someone were to come into court and say,\nI want to claim citizenship through my mother, that\nperson would still be entitled to citizenship because\nit's as of the day of birth. So this is a retroactive\nprovision.\nSo the prospective relief notion really\ndoesn't makes any sense in this context, because the\nequal protection violations have basically all already\noccurred at the time that the person who would make a\ncitizenship claim was born, and we would still be left\nin a situation where Petitioner's father would say that\nI was unable to transmit citizenship to my son and a\nwoman who was similarly situated was able to. So that\ntype of remedy is unavailable.\nIn the Court's decision in Iowa v. Bennett,\nthe bank case, they actually ordered a refund of the\ntaxes that were collected in a discriminatory manner\ndating back in time. So if you could factor out -- if\nyou could make a relief that would take away the benefit\nthat others had received, then I would agree that that\nis available, but that's not possible in this situation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hubachek, I think the\nChief asked you: If it's an equal protection violation,\nthen the Court just says it violates equal protection,\nbut whether it goes up or down, the Court has to give a\ntemporary solution, because the legislature can't be\nconvened on the spot. And the Court actually did go\nthrough that exercise, extension versus invalidation,\nmost conspicuously in Califano -- Westcott, in the\nWestcott case. It says, yes, that's what we have been\ndoing in all these cases.\nIn Sarah Frontiero's case, we didn't say:\nYou've been discriminated against; Congress, you fix it.\nWe said: You get the quarters' allowance that up until\nnow has been available only in male officers. And in\nWiesenthal, the father got the same child and care\nbenefits as the mother. So the Court was making a\ndecision for extension; it recognized it had to do that.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Absolutely. And in many of\nthe benefits cases, the same -- the same analysis was\navailable and that's the analysis that we are asking\nthat the Court apply here. But we're also making -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hubacheck, you are\nasking, I think, that the Court pronounce your client to\nbe a United States citizen. Isn't that the only\npronouncement from -- form the Court that is going to do\nyour client any good?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, Justice Scalia -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unless he's a United States\ncitizen.\nMR. HUBACHEK: This is a criminal case, so\ntechnically what we are asking is for a reversal of the\njudgment and opportunity to present this -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A reversal of the judgment\non the grounds that your client is a United States\ncitizen, right?\nMR. HUBACHEK: That it would be possible for\nhim, on these facts, to become a United States citizen,\nyes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That he is a United\nStates citizen.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That he is, not that -\nthat he is. That he is. Do you have any other case\nwhere a Court has conferred citizenship on someone who,\nunder the statutes as written, does not have it?\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, that was one of the\nissues that was debated, of course, in the Nguyen and\nMiller cases, and the Court has not said that yet but it\ncan in this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Never done.\nMR. HUBACHEK: That's correct. That's\ncorrect, but it can in this case, for a number of\nreasons. Number one is the fact that this severability\nclause is applicable to this claim. Congress actually\npassed a statute, 1421(d), in this same statutory\nscheme, that said when we are talking about\nnaturalization -- the naturalization of aliens, then you\ncannot get naturalization under those circumstances any\nother way then what's set out in this statute. They\ndidn't say that as to claims of citizenship as of birth.\nSo there is a negative implication,\nbasically, that they -- that they were not precluding\nthis type of remedy as to a citizenship claim where we\nare claiming an equal protection violation.\nThe second point is that if the Court is\nunable to grant that remedy, that would leave an equal\nprotection violation in place, and as Justice Harlan\nmade clear in Welsh -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unless -- unless we -- we\nsolve the violation the other way, by saying that the\nfather gets the shorter period that the -- than the\nmother has.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Well, again -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry, that the mother\ngets the longer period than the father has.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Right. And I think if the\nCourt -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say we can't apply that\nretroactively. Well, okay; we don't apply it\nretroactively. The people that have citizenship cannot\nconstitutionally be deprived of it, but for everybody\nelse, it's okay.\nMR. HUBACHEK: Even -- even prospectively,\nYour Honor, because this statute says you have\ncitizenship as of birth. So even if the Court were to\nrender that decision and someone were to make a claim,\nthey could still say: I had citizenship of as of birth;\ni.e., whenever I was born, which is before the Court's\ndecision. So there really -- that would be no remedy at\nall. It's a remedy -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But any of -- of the\nremedies that you are discussing with Justice Scalia\ninvolves this Court in a highly intrusive exercise of\nthe congressional power.\nLet me just ask you this as an analytic\nmatter, or as matter of logical priorities. We usually\ntalk about substance first, remedy second. Do you think\nit's permissible, logically, for us to say that because\nthe remedies here are so intrusive, that bears on our\nchoice of whether we or not we use intermediate or\nrational basis scrutiny, and because the remedies are so\ndifficult, we are going to use rational basis scrutiny?\nIs that a logical way to proceed?\nMR. HUBACHEK: I don't think so. I think\nthe Court has traditionally has said that the -- the\nquestions of a right and whether or not there exists an\nopportunity to make a claim and the remedy for it are\nanalytically distinct. So I don't believe -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it also said that the\nremedy can't be complicated, because courts are not set\nup to do that. I mean, that's what Westcott said. The\ncourt can go one way or another way; it can't do any\nfine-tuning, because it's there as a temporary\nlegislature. The ball goes back to Congress to do what\nit will, but it's just, in the interim, we need a\nsolution.\nMR. HUBACHEK: That's correct, and certainly\nCongress could do that. And the Solicitor General's\nbrief makes clear that what was being balanced here was\nconcerns about -- according to them, anyway -- concerns\nabout statelessness on the one hand and connection to\nthe United States on the other.\nIf Congress hadn't assumed based on gender\nstereotypes that men weren't caring for children, then\nit would have -- it would have been able to put them in\nthe same category as women, because they would\nunderstand that both of them would be caring for\nchildren.\nAnd it's not just the -- the situation in\n1940. As time has gone on, I believe in the National\nWomen's Center brief it points out that the number of\nmen who are raising children in single-parent families\nis increasing over time. So the problem, if anything,\nis getting worse.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Congress did make at\nleast some change, right? It -- this is -- it's no\nlonger five years; it's only two years, right?\nMR. HUBACHEK: The current system is five\nyears, two years after the -- the age of 16 -- I'm\nsorry, after the age of 14. And of course, that age\nrequirement here completely precluded\nMr. Flores-Villar's father from being able to transmit\ncitizenship because of his age. That kind of complete\npreclusion would never apply to a woman who is similarly\nsituated.\nIf the Court doesn't have any questions, I\nwill reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress in deciding who among the various\npeople born abroad should be made citizens of the United\nStates has to take into account myriad factors that may\nbear on that question and its judgment. They include\nimportantly Congress's prediction in the case of\nconferring citizenship at birth, what would be that\nperson's likely connection to the United States.\nCongress also has to consider the interaction with the\nlaws of other countries where these people may be born.\nIt may take into account equities, potential\nstatelessness or dual nationality. These are\ncomplicated questions to which the courts should defer.\nNow, in the particular -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Intermediate scrutiny\nand -- is not without some deference.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Excuse me.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Unless we apply strict\nscrutiny, which no one is arguing for, the question is,\nis it rational basis deference or is it some\nintermediate scrutiny, correct?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. And we believe that\nunder this Court's decisions, particularly in Fiallo v.\nBell and the cases discussed in that case, that it\nshould be rational basis for -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but you can't\nreally mean that because we can put up a hypothetical\nthat is very simple and then you'll explain to me why a\nU.S. citizen should be burdened in this way and the\nhypothetical is, let's assume Congress determines that\nthere are too many foreign-born children of U.S.\ncitizens coming into the United States, and that those\nforeign-born children, those born of women are placing a\ngreater burden on our economic system. They need more\ncare for reasons that Congress determines analytically\nor statistically. They are spending more money -- more\ngovernment money. And Congress passes a rule that says,\nonly the foreign-born children of men can come into the\ncountry, not of women. Wouldn't that be a rational\nbasis?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think the answer to that\nquestion lies in the Court's formulation of the test\nthat is applied in this particular context, and that is\nthe formulation drawn from Kleindienst v. Mandel that\nwas articulated in Fiallo v. Bell, and that is that\nthere has to be a facially legitimate and bona fide\nreason.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There is a facially\nlegitimate bona fide reason.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think the Court could have\nno trouble concluding that an arbitrary choice between\nmen and women -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's arbitrary about a\ngovernment saying, I want to spend less money on a new\ncitizen?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The -- the ultimate reason\nmay be legitimate, but I think the facial legitimate\ntest also encompasses means not just end, and if\nCongress is just arbitrarily choosing between men and\nwomen or people of a different race, I think given this\nCourt's tradition it could conclude that those would be\nimpermissible bases under the well-established test, but\nfor the reasons we say in our brief we don't -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What well established\ntest?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Fiallo v. Bell for -- and the\ncases underlying it and we also think -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that the rational\nbasis plus test you are talking about?\nMR. KNEEDLER: You could call it that or you\ncould call it a facially legitimate -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So now we're going to\njust continue sort of tweaking the definitions and\ncreating more variations on our review standard?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think it is -- it is a test\nthat this Court has articulated in Fiallo v. Bell and\nKleindienst v. Mandel to address this very situation,\nincluding a situation where asserted constitutional\nrights of U.S. citizens in this country are being\nclaimed. And we agree with Justice Kennedy that the\nstandard should not be more demanding, but rather if\nanything it should be less demanding where the question\nis whether someone should be made a citizen.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's hard here because\nboth the father -- this father, but many fathers and\nmothers are actually U.S. citizens who want to bring\ntheir children over as U.S. citizens. So, if the father\nwas making the claim here, you would still argue it was\na rational basis test even though he's a U.S. citizen\nand entitled to all the protections of the Constitution?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We would argue for the\nfacially legitimate -- and that was the case in Fiallo,\nin which the plaintiffs included U.S. citizens, children\nand fathers, claiming that, in a very parallel situation\nclaiming that that special privileges for illegitimate\nchildren to reunite with the mother worked an\nunconstitutional discrimination against the fathers of\nsuch children. And it was U.S. citizen fathers and\nchildren who were among the plaintiffs and the Court\nnonetheless said that this is -- there is no\nconstitutional right to pass citizenship, this is a\nquestion of Congress's judgment about who it believes\nshould be made citizens. And one of the important\nfactors Congress has looked at is connection to a U.S.\ncitizen that is in turn a proxy for what the likely\nconnection to the United States will be.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I understand that, but what\nyou are doing is applying a lesser standard to gender\ndiscrimination than is ordinarily applied to gender\ndiscrimination. Now, is there any reason to do that? I\nthink that was the thrust of the question.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, that was the issue.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now fine.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In Fiallo v. Bell.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If it's the government's\nposition you do, does the same thing apply to racial\ndiscrimination? Do you also apply a lesser standard to\nracial discrimination?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think the facially\nlegitimate standard in Fiallo v. Bell would render a\nreliance on race.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is suddenly is cutting\na big hole in the Fourteenth Amendment.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I don't think so because\nI think that same principle would be given effect in the\nway -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: First, in Fiallo we were\ndealing not with citizens, this is someone, a\nresident -- could be a resident alien wanting to bring\nin a parent or a child. So it wasn't -- that case\nwasn't about who was the citizen at birth.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It wasn't, but in the eyes of\nthe Constitution, anyone born abroad is an alien unless\nand until Congress has passed a statute making them a\ncitizen. So analytically, doctrinally it is the same\nquestion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Congress has passed -\nhas passed a statute making certain people citizens and\nthe question is, has it done so in a way that is\ncompatible with equal protection. But remind me too,\nbecause it's not in the front of my head, I thought that\nclassification that was dealt with in Fiallo, wasn't it\nunwed parentage rather than gender?\nMR. KNEEDLER: But there were claims based\non both illegitimacy and gender and there were equal\nprotection claims based on both. But if I could move on\nto the way that the statute operates because we think it\nsatisfies either standard of review in this case. And\nif I could just step back for a moment. As I mentioned,\nthere are a number of factors that Congress takes into\naccount in crafting a statute like this. 1401 deals\nwith married couples and where both parents are\ncitizens, all that is required is that one of the\nparents have resided in the United States prior to the\nbirth.\nWhere you have mixed parentage, the\nbackground of the enactment of this in 1940 and\nreenactment in 1952 and continued up to this present day\nis Congress was concerned that such a child may not have\nthe requisite connection to the United States. They\nhave a connection to the parent, but may not have a\nconnection to the United States such that Congress\nwanted to grant citizenship to that person. So what\nCongress did in the mixed citizenship situation was to\nrequire prior residency of the parent as a talisman, as\nthe Court said in Rogers v. Bellei, for a connection to\nthe United States of ten years, five years after the age\nof 14. Congress has liberalized that, but that was the\nbasic thought. Where you have unwed parents, in 1409(a)\nwhat Congress did was to follow general principles of\nthe law of illegitimacy or children born out of wedlock,\nif a father legitimates a child then it's as if the\nchild was born in a marriage, and the rule in 1401 with\nrespect to marriage applies. That is true whether both\nparents are citizens or in a mixed marriage situation.\nIf a father legitimates a child and both parents are\ncitizens, then not the one, then the child benefits from\nthe rule that if either parent was present in the United\nStates before birth he's a citizen, doesn't have to\nsatisfy the one year unbroken residency requirement\nunder 1409(c). If it's mixed parentage, and the father\nlegitimates, then the rule applicable to married mixed\ncitizen and parents applies as if the child had been\nmarried at the outset. It's a perfectly sensible and\nprovision or approach and consistent with the way this\nhas been done. What Congress did with respect to the\nmother of the child born out of wedlock where there has\nnot have been legitimation is to confer citizenship on\nthe basis of a one year residency. Now, as counsel for\nthe Petitioner explains, a mother in that situation who\nat the moment of birth, as this Court understood in\nNguyen, that mother may be the only either legal parent\nor the only parent at the moment of birth with the\nrequisite connection to the child to have an opportunity\nfor this sort of connection at birth. So the mother in\nthat circumstance is very much like the two citizen\nparent family, the only parents are parents with a\nconnection to the United States.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, if -- if\nthe classification then were that we want to encourage,\nbecause it's good for society, father/child\nrelationships, so we are going to give that advantage,\nthat is 1 year for fathers, and we're going to put the\nmothers together with the married couples, would that be\ncompatible with equal protection?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think that would\nbe -- that would depend upon a -- a -- a different\nrationale. I mean here what Congress -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I told you what the\nrationale was. The rationale was that we have lots of\nstatutes like the Family Medical and Leave Act that\nattempt to encourage fathers to have a relationship with\ntheir children, to be a legal parent, so that's the\nrationale of this classification. They want to\nencourage the father/child relationship, therefore, they\ngave this 1 year is enough for the -- for the father.\nAnd everything else is the same, except it's the father\nwho gets the 1 year, and the mother who gets the -- what\nis it, 10 years -\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think that would be a more\ndifficult question, because Congress would be -- would\nbe responding based on the -- on the expected behaviors\nand talents maybe of men and women. What's different\nhere is that's not what it's -- that's not the basis for\nthis classification. This -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it would you, in\nfact, acting on the basis of what hasn't been the\ngeneral pattern but what is becoming the new pattern.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. And in that\nsituation, Congress I think could be expected and maybe\nshould be required to do that in a gender-neutral basis\nbecause it is premising it on the behavior, but -- but\nwhat -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So there is, even though\nwe are still dealing with citizenship, you recognize\nthat there are categorizations that would run afoul of\nequal protection?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, that -- and -- and the\nquestion would be whether that's a facially legitimate\nrationale. And -- and I would want to know -- I think I\nwould want to know more about what the record for such a\njustification would be, et cetera. But I -- but I would\nlike to -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The same as in the Family\nMedical Leave Act, we are making it a parental leave\ninstead as if it had been historically a maternity.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. And in -- in that\nsituation, I think it would be expanding on a\ngender-neutral basis rather than singling out one parent\nor the other. But I -- but I would like to finish the\ndescription, I have because it's incomplete and there is\na critical piece left out, and that is that counsel for\nPetitioner says that if -- if a father legitimates an\nout-of-wedlock child, he is in the same position or that\nchild is in the same position as a child in an\nout-of-wedlock mother, and that is not likely to be so,\nand it's not likely to be so at birth. And this is the\nreason why, is when a child is legitimated, there are\ntwo parents who have the strong connection that was\ndescribed in this Court's decision in Nguyen to that\nchild, the U.S. citizen father, but also the mother, the\nalien mother in that country. So you have two parents\nwhose interests have to be taken into account.\nWhereas in the situation Congress was\naddressing in 1409(c), the situation of a child born out\nof wedlock where there was no -- at the moment of birth,\nlikely to be no recognized father, have you only the\nmother. If we -- if we think of this in -- in parallel\nto the illegitimacy -- the cases involving illegitimates\nthat this Court has had in a domestic context, I think\nthat is instructive. In a case like Lehr, where the\nquestion was whether the father of a child born out of\nwedlock should have received notice of a prospective\nadoption, the Court explained in that case that the\nfather had not taken the steps necessary to form the\nrelationship with the child, and therefore, be -- be a\nfather in the eyes of the law, then the mother alone -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You have -- we have the\nbriefs that are filled with, you know, pros and cons\nabout the statelessness business and whether it was\nreal, and I've read those and I would like your comment\non those, but I want to comment, too, on this very -\nwhat may be a very minor thing, but I did notice,\nprodded by an article, I have to say, that -- that for\nthe women there is a sense in which its tougher -\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and that's because of\nthe continuous period.\nNow, I guess it depends on how that is\nenforced, but there could be a class of people, say,\nliving in the border, near Canada or near Mexico where\nthey step across the border on Christmas day to say\nhello to my cousin, and -- and does that stop them from\ntaking advantage of that? Is it -- in other words, how\nis this enforced? Is it enforced with that rigidity?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It does have to be continuous\nresidency, you're correct -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which means that you can't\nstop with across the border? You can't -\nMR. KNEEDLER: There might be minor\nexceptions where you go across the border in Christmas\nEve. That I can't be -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there -- is there -\nwell, is there or isn't there, to your knowledge? Is\nthis enforced with total rigidity or is it enforced that\nmaybe you could go once a month or you could go on your\nbirthday, or what is the answer?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think in that situation,\nno. And the example that I was -\nJUSTICE BREYER: In that situation you\ncannot go across the border?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The example I was given when\nI asked this question was, if you have somebody who's\non -- who lives in Mexico and commutes to the United\nStates, you know, 5 days a week, you can under -- under\n-- under 1401, you can add up each day, and get to a\ntotal of 5 or 10 years of continuous -- excuse me -- of\nactual physical presence, that would not satisfy the\ncontinuous -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, if it's\ntough then and really is meant to be tough, then there\nis a -- what is the rationale for treating women in this\nrespect worse than treating men?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Congress -- the 1-year\nprovision.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The 1 year, I grant you,\nthe time 1 year is treating them better than the time 5\nyears. But the word \"continuous,\" it's really tough is\nwhat your answer leads me to believe, and they really\nmean it. I mean, then that's treating them worse than\ntreating the men. And I would like to know what is the\nrationale for treating them worse?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Congress -- Congress\nselected, because while I said the mothers are like the\ntwo-citizen family or two-citizen parents in the sense\nthat only U.S. citizens are the parent and you have some\nconnection, Congress was balancing the duration of that\nconnection or taking into account the duration of that\nconnection and it chose to make it a little bit tougher.\nAnd I -- I think that is perfectly legitimate, because\nCongress -- because you only have one parent and\nCongress was deciding, well if somebody has been here\nfor a continuous period of 1 year, then there -- then\nthere is probably a greater likelihood that that person\nwill -- will have roots here then, for example, the\nother situation where if you had a child born abroad and\ncame home in the summers, that child may not think of\nhimself or may not be regarded as an American in the\nsame way.\nSo, what Congress was focusing on a -- on a\nperiod of longer duration, which in its judgment\ncould -- could give rise to, Congress believed, a\ngreater connection to the United States.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what if -\nif the Court were to determine that this does violate\nthe Equal Protection Clause, and the court were also to\ndetermine that this is not a case that should be the\nfirst one in history in which it grants naturalization,\nwhat do you think the Court ought to do?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I think the Court ought\nto strike the eligibility of -- of anyone to get\ncitizenship on the basis of 1 year. I think it could -\nshould constrict the -- the class to those specifically\ngoverned by 1401 -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On the ground that\nit violates equal protection.\nMR. KNEEDLER: And it is a solution -- it's\na remedy -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about your\nfriend's point that that retroactively deprives people\nof citizenship that we would be saying they should have\ngotten if the Equal Protection Clause had been enforced.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I -- I think this Court\ncould legitimately take into account the -- the\nconferral of citizenship and the reliance on that. I\nthink it's parallel to -- to Heckler v. Matthews, where\nthe Court upheld a statute in which Congress took\naccount of reliance interest that had built up on\nyour -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. But here, of\ncourse, under my scenario we don't have a situation\nwhere Congress has addressed -- addressed the problem.\nSo what do we do? If somebody under the theory that we\nsay this person should not have been denied citizenship\nbecause of the unequal protection in the law, and he\ncomes in and it's the same situation, he's going to be\ndeported for not being an American citizen and he says\nI'm an American citizen.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think -- I think.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does he get the\nbenefit of that or not?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I think he does not. I\nthink -- I think the answer is that the -- and -- and\npartly for the reasons that you alluded to and\nJustice Scalia mentioned, we do not think that a court\ncan properly grant U.S. citizenship, and that that\nshould enforce -- excuse me -- inform the remedy, and\nit -- but for the people who have been granted\ncitizenship, I think the solution would be to invalidate\nthe 1-year residency requirement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But why -- why would we\ngrant that remedy when it doesn't do this Petitioner any\ngood whatever. It's -- it's a remedy that doesn't\nremedy.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I suppose -- I\nsuppose -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We are -- we aren't\ngranting relief that doesn't provide relief.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I suppose -- I suppose the\nCourt could -- could decide that at the outset, that it\nwould not be appropriate to grant that relief and not\ngo -- and not go any further.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The reason it\ndoesn't grant that relief is somewhat unusual in this\ncase. It only doesn't grant him relief because of the\nthird-party standing. He doesn't care whether he's\ntreated equally or not; he just wants to be -- claim the\nbenefit of citizenship.\nThe person where he would get relief is if\nit were the father, because the relief that he is\nentitled to is to be treated equally. That's it.\nThe relief this person is asking for is not\nto be deported. And so the problem of the relief being\ngranted is really complicated by the fact that it's a\ncase of third-party standing.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. I -- I agree with\nthat as well, which I think is all the more reason for\nthe Court to be cautious about -- about entering into\nthis. I think that -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, in\nanswering the question that way, I know you are familiar\nwith the Wiesenfeld, case, and the question was, this\nwas a father who was denied benefits to take care of a\n-- a child whose mother died at childbirth. And the\nCourt came out a unanimous judgment but split three ways\non why. And one of the members of the Court said, this\nis discrimination against the child, even though the\nclassification was -- it's called a mother's benefit -\nit's discrimination against the child because it should\nmake no difference at all whether the missing parent is\nfemale or male, that that was utterly irrational.\nThat was the Chief -- that was then Justice\nRehnquist's concurring opinion in Wiesenfeld. So he\nseemed to think that the discrimination was against the\nchild and that that counted for equal protection\npurposes.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, here the only claim\nthat has been raised is an equal protection violation of\nthe parent's asserted rights.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's what --\nSteven Wiesenfeld, the father was the plaintiff, but the\nCourt -- at least one justice's rationale was that the\ndiscrimination is really against the child, but the\nfather can raise him -\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, insofar as any claim of\ndiscrimination by the child, I think, since it's not\nbased on the child's gender, I think that would clearly\nbe a rational basis or facially legitimate standard; and\nJustice O'Connor's opinion in Miller v. Albright\naddressed the rational basis there.\nAnd here, this is not just based on the\ngender of the parent, it's based on the -- on the\ncomplexities in the legal history with respect to\nillegitimacy, and -- and how children born out of\nwedlock are dealt with, which again turns not on -- on\nstereotypes of behavior or talents, but on longstanding\nlegal regimes not just in this country but in -- in\nother countries, that until the father does something to\nhave a meaningful relationship, the mother is the -- is\nthe only legal parent, or in the terminology of this\nCourt's decision in Nguyen, the parent who is likely to\nhave the meaningful relationship.\nOnce the father comes forward in a case like\nLehr, the result is not that the father gets a veto\npower or that that only the father's interests are taken\ninto account; the answer is that you have two parents\nwhose interests are taken into -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a case where\nmother versus father. But here it's a single parent.\nThis is not a case where the father is doing something\nthat the mother regards as disadvantageous. That was in\nthe Lehr case.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you said something\nabout -- this has nothing to do with stereotypes, this\nis the way the law was? But wasn't the law shaped\nbecause of the vision of the world of being divided into\nmarried couples, where the father is what counted, and\nunwed mothers, where she was -- they say both father and\nmother, because the law didn't regard him as having any\nkind of obligation?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, again, I think this is\nthe issue the Court addressed in Nguyen, in which the\nCourt -- the Court said that there is -- there is a\ndifference at the moment of birth in the potential and\ntherefore the likelihood of a -- of a connection of\nchild to parent at the moment of birth that justified\nthe requirement that -- that the father take a step to\nlegitimate the child, in order to be able to -- to be on\nan equal footing with the mother with respect to -- to\nthe rights.\nAnd here the residency requirement is what\nmeasures the connection of the parent to the United\nStates, not the child to the parent; but we think the\nsame point obtains, that at the moment of birth in\nanother country, for example, another country might take\na view that this Court did in Nguyen and Lehr and cases\nlike that, that the father doesn't have a meaningful\nconnection to the child in the sense that one would\npredict citizenship on the basis of, until there had\nbeen some formal steps which would happen after birth to\nestablish the relationship with the child. If it was\nconstitutional for Congress to do that in Nguyen, it is\nconstitutional for Congress to take into account that\nother countries might do the very same thing.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In Nguyen, I thought that\nthis Court relied on the biological factor, which is not\nso here. I mean, here there is no question that this is\nthe -- the natural parent of the child.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, yes, but in Nguyen the\nCourt did not look at the circumstances of the\nparticular case. It looked -- it looked generally to\nwhat would have justified Congress's acting\ncategorically as we think Congress has to have the\nflexibility to do. And -- and I think the questions in\nthese statutory provisions show that there are numerous\ncompeting equities and considerations that have to be\ntaken into -- into account.\nAnd that -- that is what -- that is what\nCongress did here with respect to establishing a -- to\nrequiring a close nexus to the United States. And if -\nif in another country a father has -- has legitimated or\ndone those steps, then you have a U.S. citizen mother\nand a father in another country that is directly\nparallel to the married mixed -- mixed parent marriage;\nand Congress was concerned about whether that child was\ngoing to be sufficiently affiliated with the United\nStates to justify a conferral of citizenship.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if we\ndetermine that the only remedy we can impose is to\nequalize up -- in other words, add to the burden on the\nmother rather than relieving the father of it, do you\nhave authority for the proposition that we can address\nthat issue hypothetically? In other words, without\nmaking a decision on the equal protection question on\nthe merits?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Um -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, look\nahead and if you say, look, the only remedy that we are\ngoing to be able to give this person is a remedy that\nisn't going to benefit him regardless of how the merits\nare decided, therefore we don't reach the merits.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't have -- I don't have\nauthority from -- from a decision of this Court. I may\n-- I may be not recalling something, I don't.\nBut I do believe in the special context -\ncontext of citizenship, that there might a justification\nfor the -- for Court's doing that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that would be in\neffect saying that we have no jurisdiction, because\nthere is no standing. Because there -- there is no\nremediation that the Court can make.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I suppose that would be\none way of looking at it. I mean the Court\ntraditionally has looked at -- at questions of\nseverability as -- as a question of remedy, and not -\nand not at the outset. But this is to be sure a very\npeculiar situation. And I should also point out -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, in answer\nto the Chief's question, you know -- I mean, there have\nbeen a number of cases raising this extension versus\nnullification, and in every one of them the Court did\nmake a choice. It didn't say well, we can't make any\nchoice. Even in the one, which is\nMatthews v. Heckler -\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the Court did make a\nchoice then. It was the rare case where the Court\nequalized down. But I don't know any one of them -\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I think that is\nordinarily the case. But I -- but this is -- this is a\ndifficult context, and just to go back with a\ncomplication from the remedial approach that the Chief\nJustice suggested. If the Court declared an expansion\nof citizenship, and if that was held to apply to\neverybody similarly situated, rather than just the\nPetitioner in this case, it would raise questions about\nwhether Congress would have the freedom after such a\ndeclaration of a perhaps dramatic expansion of\ncitizenship under the prior law, to remedy that with\nrespect to people who for the -- following this Court's\ndecision, at least the logic of the Court's decision\nwould suggest that they were citizens, too.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there -- is there\nanything that rings a bell in this in your mind, of -- I\nmean, the thing that goes the other way is the right of\nan American citizen to pass his American citizenship on\nto his children. And when we talk about -- when we talk\nabout Congress's power over naturalization, is there\nanything that's drawn a distinction between the general\npower, which are people who are not citizens to become\ncitizens, but what it seems to me intuitively is a\ndifferent situation, of the right to pass your\ncitizenship on? Does that ring any bell at all?\nMR. KNEEDLER: There is no such right.\nAnd Wong Kim Ark -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not saying there is\nsuch a right. I just wonder if it rings any bell at all\nthat this has ever been discussed in anything you've\ncome across.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the Court's\ndecision in -- in -- the dissenters in -- in Nguyen\ndiscussed this. But we think it's clear that under\nthis -- under Wong Kim Ark and Rogers v. Bellei that -\nthat that is equally an exercise of Congress's\nnaturalization power which is subject to the same\nplenary standards -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Just looking -\nin trying to get your memory -- well, does something\ncome to mind the opposite way that -- where the Court\ndid go into a long exegesis about the law, including\nconstitutional law, and then says at the end, well, but\nyou are not entitled to memory -- to a remedy because of\nsome other -\nMR. KNEEDLER: If this is going back to\nremedy, I don't specifically.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Hubachek, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN F. HUBACHEK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HUBACHEK: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe rationale that the Solicitor General's\noffice offers today is that further assumptions can be\nmade that even after men do the things that the Court\nsaid were legitimately required of them, that they\nlegitimate, that they have an opportunity to form a\nrelationship with their child, that further gender-based\nassumptions should be put into place and say that, well,\nbut you are not going to be the real father or you're\nnot going to be the real parent. Whereas in the case of\nwomen we are going to assume that when they had have the\nnonmarital child they are going to be in charge and that\nwhen a father legitimates and does whatever is required\nwherever the child is born, we are going to assume that\nthe mother is involved still. But the very facts of\nthis case demonstrate that that's not the case. That in\nthis case Petitioner's father raised him and\nPetitioner's mother was not involved in his growing up\nand he brought him to the United States -- I'm sorry, if\nI was getting a question. So it's basically piling\nfurther gender-related inferences on top of the ones\nthat are already in place in order to serve to justify\nthis distinction.\nNow, with respect to the Fiallo case, there\nis a tradition of allowing citizens to transmit\ncitizenship. Fiallo involved getting aliens into the\nUnited States. There is no tradition that dates back to\n1350 where citizens enjoyed rights to bring aliens into\nthe United States, but it does date back to 1350 that\nyou've been able to confer citizenship on your\nforeign-born children. So it is differently situated\nand it is differently situated in the very structure of\nthe statute that we are talking about today. Congress\nvery specifically eliminated the ability of courts to\nchange the rules of naturalization of aliens. It\nbasically used language very similar to the courts\ndecision in Ginsberg and said that you can be\nnaturalized under this provision and no other way. It\ndidn't say that as to citizens as of birth. Citizens as\nof birth are treated differently. There is a\nseverability clause in the statute, so that would apply\nto them and that brings into play all the various\nremedies that the Court has granted with the respect to\nextension over the years.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You referred -- I'm\nsorry, you refer to the tradition of passing -- do you\nagree with Mr. Kneedler that there is no such right?\nMR. HUBACHEK: I agree that the Constitution\ndoesn't guarantee that right. Our point is that it's a\ntraditional right and that Congress has always provided\nfor it even in the period between 1802 and 1855 where\nthe statute was strangely drafted and didn't provide for\nit. This Court made clear in Montana v. Kennedy that\nwhen Congress remedied that situation it made that\nremedy retroactive. So basically we have an unbroken\ntradition dating back to 1350, that's why I think that\nthis right should be treated differently than the\nquestions of admissions of aliens in Fiallo. And,\nagain, there is also Chadha Zadvydas that made clear\nthat the Constitution limits the Congress's power even\nin the context of naturalization. And then with respect\nto the third-party standing issue, the Court has granted\nthird-party standing to criminal defendants whose are\nraising third-party constitutional issues in their\ncriminal cases, and the same analysis should apply here.\nWe can still look at the right from the perspective of\nthe Petitioner's father and if the Court grants a\nlevelling down remedy, that would not remedy the\nsituation the Petitioner's father would be in because\nboth before and after the Court's decision the children\nof women, similarly situated women, would be citizens\nand Petitioner's father's son would not.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What were the criminal\ncases where there was -- where the defendant was\npermitted to raise -\nMR. HUBACHEK: Campbell & Powers. Those are\nboth cases where the criminal defendant asserted rights\nof -- in one case it's a petit juror and another in the\nother case it was a grand juror, and there were\ndiscriminatory preemptory challenges in those cases, and\nthe court allowed those criminal defendants to assert\nthose constitutional rights.\nSeveral members of the court also found\nthere was standing in Miller. Kowalski pointed out in\nCraig v. Boren that there is a very forgiving standard\nwhen third-party rights are at issue in the case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nCounsel, the case submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m.,
