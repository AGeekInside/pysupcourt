        "content": "(10:12 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument first today in Case 07-9712, Puckett v. United\nStates.\nMr. Isaacson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LARS R. ISAACSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ISAACSON: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case is framed by two major facts:\nJimmy Puckett pled guilty and waived his fundamental\nright to trial in exchange for a promise by the\ngovernment that they agreed he was qualified for a\nthree-level reduction in his offense level; and the\ngovernment of the United States breached this promise.\nThe teachings of this Court in this\nsituation are instructive. For a plea to be valid, it\nmust be voluntary and intelligent.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Isaacson, you said\nthere were two facts. Aren't there three? Isn't it a\nfact that after the plea bargain the defendant in\nessence broke his side of the bargain by committing a\ncrime while he was in jail?\nMR. ISAACSON: No, Your Honor. He did not\nbreach the plea agreement by doing that. He --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I used to teach\ncontract law and I'll tell you that would have been a\nbreach of contract. That would have been a breach on\nhis part.\nNow, the government has conceded the breach\nof the plea agreement. I don't -- I can't understand\nwhy they did that, but they apparently have conceded it.\nDoes that mean that we have to ignore it for purposes of\ndeciding what the -- what the remedy is? Ignore the\nreality that there was a breach? I mean, you know,\nif the government said, we will ask the court to\nsentence at the lower end because of the -- the remorse\nthat the defendant has shown, and the defendant then\ndemonstrates that he has no remorse by -- you know,\nsuppose he comes and stabs the judge -- is the\ngovernment really supposed to have to go before the\njudge and say, \"Your Honor, this man is really\nremorseful and you should sentence him at the lower\nend\"?\nIt seems to me it's a basic principle of\ncontract law that a party to a contract cannot take\naction which makes it impracticable for the other side\nto carry out his part of the bargain, and that's what\nyour client did. The government couldn't practicably go\nin and make that argument when he had demonstrated\nhimself to be an unremorseful criminal.\nMR. ISAACSON: The government in this case\ndrafted a plea agreement, and most plea agreements --\nI've practiced in the Northern District of Texas quite\noften, and virtually every plea agreement has a\nprovision in it that says if the defendant does some\ntype of criminal activity, thus it will render it void.\nThis plea agreement did not have that in it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.\nMR. ISAACSON: So it's different than most\nplea agreements.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you want to us make the\ninference that the impermissible or criminal activity\nwas permitted by the absence of this specific clause.\nYou say there is no implied condition, no implied\ncovenant?\nMR. ISAACSON: Well, I'm not -- what we are\nsaying is the government needs to obey the promise in\nthe plea agreement. The promise in the plea agreement\nis --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the questions so far\nindicate that one of the promises was an implied promise\nthat you will keep the terms of the agreement by lawful\nbehavior. So that just -- what you say just begs the\nquestion.\nNow, I recognize the government has conceded\na breach, and we will probably move on from that point.\nBut, as Justice Scalia indicates, it puts the case in a\nvery artificial posture, it seems to me.\nMR. ISAACSON: It is -- well, it is up to\nthe judge to determine whether or not the defendant gets\nthe acceptance points or not. The bargain here was not\nthat Mr. Puckett would get the points, but that the\ngovernment would agree that he was qualified to receive\nthose points.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And there is nothing\ntheoretically inconsistent with the government -- you\ncan feel remorse. I mean, you're not going to do it\nagain. You going to feel remorse every time you do it,\nbut that doesn't mean he didn't feel remorse from the\ncrime he was pleading to.\nMR. ISAACSON: Yes, 3E1.1. There is a\nnumber of different factors that go into whether or not\nsomeone gets the acceptance points. It is the judge's\ndiscretion to give those points and there are a number\nof different factors that go into it. Certainly the\ntermination of criminal activity is one 1 of those\nfactors the court looks at, but it's not the only one.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But this judge said --\nand he was open in his thinking. He said: \"Unheard to\nme that I would give acceptance of responsibility credit\nto someone that as soon as he gets sent to jail is out\nthere committing another crime.\"\nMR. ISAACSON: That is what Judge --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The judge did say that.\nHe said it was unknown to him that judges give\nacceptance of responsibility credit to someone who in\nthe interval between the plea and when he shows up in\ncourt for sentencing commits another crime.\nMR. ISAACSON: That is what Judge Sanders\ndid say.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Your point is not that he\nshould have gotten the reduction. Your point is that\nthe government should have made the recommendation.\nMR. ISAACSON: Well, the position --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't it? Isn't that your\npoint?\nMR. ISAACSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The agreement called for\nthem to make a recommendation and they didn't make it.\nIn fact, they recommended the contrary. And that's your\ngripe, right?\nMR. ISAACSON: The plea agreement did not\nsay the government had to get up there and make a\nstatement at sentencing that he was supposed to get his\npoints. They just agreed he was entitled to his\nacceptance points.\nThere was two parts of the plea agreement.\nThe first part that they agreed to was, you know, that\nhe was entitled to those points; and the second part was\nthat they would recommend at sentencing that he get the\nlower in the guideline range. The first part was not --\ndid not say they had to get up there and say that. They\nchose on their own to get up there and breach the plea\nagreement by saying, he's not entitled to those points.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that in the\nrecord, do you know offhand? Where the plea agreement\nis?\nMR. ISAACSON: It's page 54a of the Joint\nAppendix volume 1, paragraphs 8 and 9.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose Justice\nGinsburg's point is relevant, though, on the question of\nprejudice. If the judge gets up there and says, I don't\ncare what the government says, I am not going to give\nanybody a departure when they have committed another\ncrime, then you haven't been prejudiced by the\ngovernment's breach.\nMR. ISAACSON: Well -- I believe he has been\nprejudiced by the government's breach, because once the\ngovernment violates the plea agreement on the first\nlevel, as we know under the prior precedents of this\ncase, it makes the actual plea agreement void. And\nsecondly, the Santobello case clearly talks about it is\nnot important the effect on the sentencing judge\nwhat the -- in Santobello the government breached a plea\nagreement and the judge said: It doesn't matter the\ngovernment breached the plea agreement; I would have\ndone the same thing anyway; it makes no different. This\nCourt said specifically that's not relevant.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, the judge would have\nknown about what happened anyway from -- from the\npresentence investigation, wouldn't he?\nMR. ISAACSON: Correct.\nI guess the point I am trying to make is the\nagreement here was not that Judge Sanders would give him\nacceptance points. The fact is the government made the\nposition -- and I should point out that Mr. Puckett, he\ngave up all his rights just for this slim reed of hope.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he could have, if he\nfelt that way -- I mean, there they were in the\ncourtroom; all of them knew about the plea agreement\nbecause there had been the Rule 11 colloquy when it was\ntaken, right?\nMR. ISAACSON: I'm sorry, ma'am. I didn't\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When the plea was\ntaken --\nMR. ISAACSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- it was the same judge,\nwasn't it?\nMR. ISAACSON: Yes, Judge Sanders.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And so they were all\nthere and the defendant was asked all these questions,\nand the government-- and the judge knew about the\ngovernment's side of the plea bargain.\nMR. ISAACSON: Right, yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it was not a secret to\nanyone that the government said it would ask for the\nextra acceptance of responsibility credit. And yet the\ndefendant and his lawyer stand there and they don't say\na word: Wait a minute, judge. They didn't object at --\nthere was no motion to withdraw the plea, was there?\nMR. ISAACSON: Mr. Puckett had made a motion\nprior to the sentencing to withdraw his plea on his own.\nHe basically pro se had done that. But not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But --\nMR. ISAACSON: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Before the judge there\nwas no plea to withdraw the plea.\nMR. ISAACSON: During the sentencing, no,\nthere was not.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And so that's why we are\n-- if he had asked to withdraw the plea, then we'd have\na different case. But he didn't, so we are here on\nplain-error review.\nMR. ISAACSON: Our point is that we suggest\nplain error shouldn't be applied to this case. This\ncourt in Santobello said 35 years ago when the\ngovernment breaches a plea agreement it can never stand.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Santobello was a case\nwhere there was a timely objection.\nMR. ISAACSON: That is correct, but the\nprinciples of whether or not when the government\nbreaches a plea agreement that renders the underlying\nconviction void raises it to a different level.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why should that be the case?\nI know plea agreements are not strictly governed by\ncontract law, but there is an analogy and your whole\nargument seems to be that the government's breach\nrendered the plea agreement void. But why would that\nso? There was a plea agreement, voluntarily entered\ninto, and then there was a breach. So, why shouldn't\nthe issue be what is the remedy for the breach? And why\nshouldn't it be governed by the plain-error rule like\nmost errors that occur at trial?\nMR. ISAACSON: I would suggest it goes to\nthe very heart of whether or not he actually pled.\nJustice Ginsburg's raised a great point about what Judge\nSanders did in this case. He was long involved. The\npromises in the plea agreement were talked about. Mr.\nPuckett had every right to rely upon those promises when\nhe foreclosed his right to jury trial, his right to\npresent witnesses on his own behalf. This is a\nsolemn --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you can say that in\nevery case in which parties enter into a contract and\nlater there is a breach. The fact that one of the\nparties later breaches doesn't mean that there never was\na contract. There was an agreement that he voluntarily\nentered into at that time. And then there was a --\nsubsequently there was a breach, but that doesn't mean\nthat he involuntarily -- he did not voluntarily enter\ninto the agreement, does it?\nMR. ISAACSON: I would suggest this Court's\nprecedent is that it has to be a knowing waiver of his\nrights, that promises that are unfulfilled or\nunfulfillable render the plea itself void. The\nconstitutional due process overtones or overpinnings of\na plea agreement as opposed to a normal contract makes\nthis different.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What relief are you\nseeking now? You didn't -- you didn't ask to withdraw\nthe plea when you were before the sentencing judge.\nMR. ISAACSON: We request -- what relief do\nI want?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.\nMR. ISAACSON: Mr. Puckett would like the\nplea agreement to be set aside and be allowed to take\nthis case to trial.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which would expose him to\na considerably greater penalty.\nMR. ISAACSON: Potentially, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't it suffice to\ngive your client everything that he was entitled to if\nthe case were remanded to a different judge and the\ngovernment were required to go before that judge and\nmake the commitment that it undertook in the plea\nagreement?\nMR. ISAACSON: We believe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't that be a\nperfectly satisfactory remedy?\nMR. ISAACSON: We believe that the action of\nthe government, again, rendered the plea agreement\nitself void, without value, and he would -- Mr.\nPuckett --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you have to say that.\nBut let's assume I don't agree with that. Let's assume\nI agree with Justice Alito that his entry into it was\nvoluntary and all that's happened is that one of the\ncommitments on the part of one of the parties has not\nbeen complied with. Why isn't it an adequate remedy for\nthat problem to send it back to a new judge and have the\ngovernment come before that judge and make the same\ncommitment it was supposed to under the agreement?\nMR. ISAACSON: Certainly that is a remedy\nsome circuits have used. Why that is not effective, we\nbelieve the defendant should have the right to be able\nto choose. When it reaches this level, the plea\nagreement is void.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask essentially two\nquestions. You mentioned the fact that this is not --\nthis is an unusual agreement, and that some of the\nprovisions were negotiated and the record shows they\nwere -- they were deliberately undertaken. It seems to\nme that this was probably a scrivener's error. The\nnormal -- most plea agreements would include a provision\nthat if the defendant engaged in unlawful conduct, all\nbets are off. And my hunch was that somebody just\nforgot to put the boilerplate language in the agreement.\nIs that fair to say? I can't imagine the government\nnegotiating an agreement that doesn't include that\nclause.\nMR. ISAACSON: I certainly can't put myself\non the sides back then. I think it's fair to say it's\nunusual. The government in its breach -- sorry -- in\nits brief indicated it could have included it in there.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It did include it in the\nmotion, didn't they?\nMR. ISAACSON: It was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't there a motion --\nMR. ISAACSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- for credit for\nacceptance of responsibility, and had as a condition\nthat the defendant be law-abiding?\nMR. ISAACSON: Yes, that was included in the\nmotion filed the next day for the additional point, that\nis correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So isn't it odd that the\n-- that these documents both meant to serve the same\npurpose, one has the provision for law-abiding conduct\nin the future and the other doesn't?\nMR. ISAACSON: Well, one is a plea agreement\nthat is entered in open court with the defendant present\nwith his attorney and the second is a motion filed by\nthe United States attorney the day after. So they are\ndifferent. Certainly they have different, I would\nsuggest, importance.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But going back to my\nquestion, isn't it a likely explanation for the\ndefendant's lawyer's failure to object that he just\ndidn't realize this agreement didn't have this normal\nprovision in it?\nMR. ISAACSON: I -- I can't. As to\nwhether -- I would suggest that it is -- this is a --\nnormally, these are normally included in these\nagreements, I would suggest to you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. ISAACSON: But I would suggest to you\nalso that it was not included in this agreement, and\nsince the government drafted it I don't think we can\njust assume it should be there.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, I understand that.\nBut the other thing I wanted to ask you: You keep using\nthe term \"void.\" Do our cases say that any breach of a\nplea agreement renders it void rather than subject to\nsome kind of other remedy?\nMR. ISAACSON: Well, if it is -- I think the\nlanguage of -- of Brady -- certainly a plea must stand\nunless it is induced by misrepresentation, unfulfilled\nor unfulfillable promises. Recently in the Bousley,\ncase: Statements in there can't go; not good if it's\ninduced by misrepresentation; Machibroda --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But those are cases that\nsay that the remedy is setting aside the -- the guilty\nplea, but they don't characterize the -- the agreement\nas having become void, if I -- if I remember correctly.\nMR. ISAACSON: Well, again, I am -- citing\nfrom Machibroda: A guilty plea, if induced by promises\nor threats which would deprive it of a private or\nvoluntary act are void.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but those -- that\ngoes to the integrity of the guilty plea, not to whether\nor not the underlying contract became void, I think.\nMaybe I'm missing something.\nMR. ISAACSON: Well, I -- I think what we\nare saying is once the government takes its action, it\ndeprives the plea of its voluntary character.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't -- it doesn't\nretroactively render the government's promise a\nmisrepresentation. Every time a -- a party to a\ncontract fails to comply with a contract, he hasn't been\nguilty of fraud. \"Misrepresentation\" would mean the\ngovernment had no intention of complying with it when --\nwhen it entered into it, and you -- you don't assert\nthat was the case, do you?\nMR. ISAACSON: No, but I would suggest that\nSantobello again talks about the intent, whether or not\n-- in that case there were two prosecutors who didn't\nknow what one -- the other one was doing, and this Court\nsaid that's not important; it is the integrity of the\nplea that's important and the government's breach\nthereof.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under the law of contracts\nI assume -- I haven't looked it up yet -- that you can't\nrescind for a nonmaterial breach. A trivial breach\ndoesn't always allow recision. And isn't it trivial if\nthe district court said: You know, I don't care if the\nAttorney General of the United States and the Solicitor\nGeneral himself both came into the court on their hands\nand knees begging me to do this. I wouldn't do this. I\nwouldn't give you an increase.\nMR. ISAACSON: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So it seems to me an\nimmaterial breach, other than as to one level -- and\ncorrect me if I am wrong. I take it as to level one --\nor as to the third level, they need the recommendation\nbefore they have the authority to reduce. Am I right\nabout that?\nMR. ISAACSON: I'm sorry -- I am missing --\nwhat are you talking about?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There are some instances\nin which the -- the prosecution must make the\nrecommendation before the district judge has the\nauthority to depart downward, am I correct?\nMR. ISAACSON: I -- I -- I am sorry. For\nthe downward departure and acceptance of responsibility,\nthey are different. For the first two points, it can be\ndone in the plea agreement. The third has to be done by\nthe prosecution.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's right. So -- so\nthis -- this district judge, I take it, did not have the\nauthority to go down by -- by a third without the\nrecommendation?\nMR. ISAACSON: Well, the government filed a\nmotion. I don't know if they officially had withdrawn\nit or not. I know at sentencing they argued against it,\nso -- I am not sure if the judge had the power to or\nnot. The motion was already on file. The government\nhad already asked for that. Now, they changed their\nmind.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Even as to the third\nlevel, the district judge said, you know, I will assume\nthat they have made the argument. I will assume they\nhave made the argument. I wouldn't hear the -- I -- I\nwouldn't grant -- I wouldn't follow the recommendation.\nI am not going to depart downward even assuming the\ngovernment -- it seems to me that there is -- the\ngovernment's breach is immaterial.\nMR. ISAACSON: Well, in terms of materiality\nof the breach, in Santobello there are those exact\nwords: The government is in a very poor position to\ntalk materiality after they've breached the agreement.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My reading of Santobello\nis the same as yours on that point, and it's difficult\nfor me to understand.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was part of this\nagreement that was honored. In fact, the judge after\nhaving said that, I never heard of giving credit for\nresponsibility to somebody who commits a crime in the\ninterim, but he said: I understand there was an\nagreement to sentence at the low end, and that's what\nI'm going to do.\nMR. ISAACSON: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So if you say what you\nwant is a trial, the defendant would be exposed to not\njust the upper level; plus weren't there add-ones in\nthis case that the judge ordered to be served\nconcurrently rather than consecutively?\nMR. ISAACSON: Yes, there were three\nunderlying Federal charges that he was on supervisory\nrelease for that the judge ran concurrently with the\nsentence in this case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What would counsel say about\na case in which it's unclear whether there is a breach?\nThere is a factual dispute as to whether there was a\nbreach. Let's say the government agrees that it will\nreserve the right to call all relevant facts to the\nattention of the sentencing judge, but won't take a\nposition on sentencing. And the prosecutor in\nsentencing makes certain remarks that might be\ninterpreted as taking a position or might be interpreted\nas simply calling facts to the judge's attention.\nWould it be your position that when a\ndefendant hears that, the defendant can sit back and\nwait and see whether he or she is satisfied with the\nsentence and then after this sentence is imposed raise\nthe issue of breach on appeal and not be subject to\nplain error, rather than calling it to the attention of\nthe sentencing judge at the time when the -- the\npotential breach could be adjudicated?\nMR. ISAACSON: I think there are two parts\nto your question, Your Honor, if I could address them.\nIn regard to a de minimus breach of the plea agreement,\nwe recognize that technical defects in a plea agreement\nmay not always require automatic reversal. However, the\ngovernment must always fulfill completely the promises\nthey have made in the agreement. And that goes to the\ndifference between a -- a plea agreement is being\ndifferent than a normal contract.\nIn a normal contract, you think of a -- an\nExxon merging with Mobil, things of that nature. This\nis a situation where the government's -- the obligations\nin the plea agreement for the vast majority are on the\ndefendant, what he has to do. He gives up his rights.\nHe must cooperate, things of that nature. As on page\n51a shows, the government's agreements are extremely\nsmall. There's only two paragraphs. And that's\nnormally how it is. Our position is if the government\nbreaches its promises, that's when it must be reversed.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I'm not sure that really\nanswers my question.\nMR. ISAACSON: Well --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are you saying as to some\nerrors there is a plain-error rule, in some breaches\nthere is a plain-error rule, but not as to all breaches?\nMR. ISAACSON: No. I'm -- what I'm saying\nis the threshold of whether there is a breach or not --\nthe question has been posed of whether or not every\nsingle breach is automatic reversal.\nWe -- we recognize that there may be some\nthat have absolutely no basis or do not really imply or\ngo into what the government promised to do. Because the\ngovernment's promises as a part of the plea agreement,\nagain, are just two paragraphs of this case. Our\nsuggestion is when the government breaches what they\npromised to do, that's when the automatic reversal --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you are saying, if -- if\nI understand you correctly, that even if at the trial\nyour client's lawyer had objected and had -- and had\nsaid, Your Honor, the government promised to recommend,\nyou know, a lower thing, what the trial judge would have\nto have said was, the plea agreement is invalid. And\nthe trial judge could not say, oh, yes, the government\nhas to make that recommendation.\nYou are -- you are saying it is invalidated\nby the mere fact of the government's not having done it,\nright?\nMR. ISAACSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So no objection need to be\nmade or can be made, right?\nMR. ISAACSON: Well, certainly, we -- we'd\nnever suggest --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wow.\nMR. ISAACSON: Well, Your Honor, it -- it\nseems harsh and perhaps it is harsh, but the government\nhas to abide by the contracts they make.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I take it -- you\nnever really answered Justice Alito's question. I take\nit that the defendant and his counsel can knowingly\nrecognize that an error is being committed, say nothing,\nlisten to the sentence, and then object later. That's\nyour position, yes or no?\nMR. ISAACSON: For it to be reversible, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's inconsistent\nwith the answer you gave me.\nMR. ISAACSON: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The answer you gave me is\nthat automatically the guilty plea is washed out --\nautomatically.\nMR. ISAACSON: We -- if the government\nbreaches the plea agreement, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is automatically washed\nout?\nMR. ISAACSON: Well, I would suggest --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And, therefore, he\ncannot -- he cannot sit around and wait to see what\nhappens. What happens is -- whatever happens, it's\ninvalid. The plea agreement is no good. You have to\nhave a new trial.\nMR. ISAACSON: I would suggest that the word\n\"void\" may also be \"voidable.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Voidable -- then your\nanswer to me would be different. It's -- it's not void.\nIt's voidable, so that he can play dog in the manger and\nwait and see what happens, and then if it's in interest\nthat -- in his interest to void it, he does. If it's in\nhis interest not to void it, he doesn't.\nMR. ISAACSON: Your Honor, these are not\neasy issues. Certainly, defense attorneys should not\never sit on his hands and let these things go. To take\na chance and to just say, oh, we are going to do nothing\nand just sandbag, like is suggested by the government,\nI'm suggesting that is never going to occur.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would not be\ncost-free for you, because if you just sit there and\nsay, you know, the agreement is void, the government is\ngoing to say, well, fine, I will see you in court; and\nwe will have a trial; and you are going to get twice as\nmuch as you would have gotten anyway.\nYou have some interest, since you entered\nthe guilty plea, in going forward with the plea.\nMR. ISAACSON: It's absolutely -- Mr.\nPuckett --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but let's put\nit this way. Maybe this is the same question anyway.\nLet's say it is the same facts as we have here but\ninstead of saying, I can't do this, the judge says, I'm\ngoing to do this. And, look, I think you are\nremorseful. I'm going to give you three points. And\nthat's all you agreed with the government. The\ngovernment says we'll recommend it, and the judge says,\nwell, you're going to get it anyway. I think you should\nget it. The agreement has still been breached, right?\nThe government didn't recommend.\nMR. ISAACSON: It has been breached.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So in that\nsituation, you think you can withdraw the agreement?\nMR. ISAACSON: I would suggest that it would\nbe at the defendant's option to do so. The point that\nI'm trying to make --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But why -- why should the\ndefendant have the option to withdraw from an agreement\nwhen he got everything under the best possible\ncircumstances that he could have expected?\nMR. ISAACSON: Because the government --\nwell, we don't know that, what the sentence would have\nbeen by the sentencing judge.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but we are talking\nabout the Chief Justice's hypothetical at this point.\nAnd they -- in his hypothetical, the sentencing judge\nsays, I'm going to give you the three points; you are\ngoing to get everything that on the rosiest scenario you\ncould have hoped for.\nWhy should he be able to withdraw his plea\nat that point?\nMR. ISAACSON: Because the jurisprudence\nteaches that the result of the effect on the sentencing\njudge is simply irrelevant. If the government breach --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, your\nposition is -- is kind of a theoretical formalistic\nposition, that -- I'm not sure if this is the wrong\nwords here -- there is a metaphysical quality to the\nplea, and even though things turn out as well to him as\nhe could possibly have expected had the agreement been\nkept punctiliously, if the government simply omits the\nwords he can walk away from the plea? I mean, that's\nyour position?\nMR. ISAACSON: I believe so, yes. But there\nis a reason for it. This Court has stated the\ngovernment cannot breach the plea agreement. That's all\nwe're saying. The power the government has in reducing\nthe plea, the rights the defendants are giving up, it\nshould be at the option of the defendant to decide.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but usually -- I mean,\nthe theory of relief in contract law depends upon relief\nfrom something. And if, in fact, there is -- there is\nno discernible damage that has been suffered, if on the\nother hand -- again, taking the Chief's hypothetical --\nthere is an affirmative demonstration that no damage\noccurred, normal principles of contract would say there\nis nothing to give him relief from. The law of contract\nis -- is not a metaphysical construct. Why should the\nlaw of plea agreements be?\nMR. ISAACSON: I -- I'm not suggesting it\nwould be metaphysical. I'm simply suggesting --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I think you are. I\nmean, you are saying even though he has come out with,\nyou know, a rose in his mouth, he can still, if he is\ncrazy enough, throw away the whole plea agreement.\nMR. ISAACSON: I think that suggests that\nthe result on the judge has to do with the breach, what\nthe government does. The concept is, if the government\nbreaches the plea agreement, the defendants should have\nthe right to withdraw from the plea even if there is no\neffect on the sentence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What I'm getting at -- I\nthink what we are all trying to get at -- is in order to\nhave a rule, an absolute rule like yours, we usually\nlook for a good reason to have that rule. And since we\nare talking about an agreement, the place to look for\nthe good reason is in the consequences to the defendant.\nAnd when the consequences are terrific, when they are\nthe best that he could possibly have hoped for, there\ndoesn't seem to be a good reason to adopt your very\ntheoretical construct of agreement.\nIs there some reason that we are just not\nseeing?\nMR. ISAACSON: Because it doesn't occur. I\nmean, the government could not cite a single case in\nwhich this --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Never mind what the\ngovernment can cite. I'm asking you if there is a good\nreason to adopt this absolute rule of yours.\nMR. ISAACSON: There is an absolute -- the\ngood reason is the defendant should get the promises the\ngovernment has elicited for his giving up of his\nfundamental constitutional rights. 99.9 percent of the\ntime that's going to be adverse to the defendant, as it\nwas in this case.\nA possibly hypothetical situation where the\njudge would forego or ignore what the United States\nattorney says and give him acceptance points is so rare,\nas I suggest, to not really be --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this kind of\nconceptual question? Is it your view that a breach of a\nplea agreement can never be concluded to be harmless\nerror?\nMR. ISAACSON: Harmless error? Yes, I -- if\nit -- well, harmless error if you are talking about\nstructural error, I mean it's a little different\nanalysis.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm trying to get rid of\nthe labels like \"plain error\" and \"structural.\" But if\nin fact it's totally harmless and everybody agrees it's\nharmless, would the government still have to -- or would\nthere be an adverse consequence nevertheless?\nMR. ISAACSON: Yes, I believe so.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So, there could never be\nharmless error, harmless breach of a plea agreement?\nMR. ISAACSON: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why wouldn't someone read\nwhat happened here as the defendant saying, well, I\ndidn't get the acceptance credit, but the judge is still\nsentencing me at the low end, and he's still making the\nsentences run concurrently, so I think -- why, if he\ndoesn't try to withdraw the plea, why isn't it the\nlogical assumption that he says I didn't get the whole\npromise but I got part of it, and I'll take it?\nMR. ISAACSON: Well, I think sometimes the\ndefendant might well do that. I mean, it's not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do we know this one\ndidn't?\nMR. ISAACSON: Well, by certainly the appeal\nthat we raised. Certainly he stated on the record some\nquestions or concerns about what overall had happened to\nhim, and certainly he pursued this appeal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nWe will give you a couple minutes for rebuttal.\nMR. ISAACSON: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Schertler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA H. SCHERTLER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. SCHERTLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nWhen the government breaches a plea\nagreement, an objection made in the district court\nserves important purposes that relate to the functioning\nof Federal courts. It permits the district court and\nthe parties to determine whether a breach has occurred,\nand it also, in many cases, may permit an immediate cure\nof that breach to be administered, obviating the need\nfor appellate review of the issue altogether.\nA central purpose of the contemporaneous\nobjection rule is to ensure that the district court\nproceedings are as free of error as possible. And that\npurpose is served in this context, the plea breach\ncontext, as it is in others.\nRule 52(b) reinforces the contemporaneous\nobjection rule by placing a heavier burden on the party\nwho does not object in the district court to win relief\non appeal.\nThe government's submission to the court\ntoday is that the plain-error standard does apply to\nforfeited claims that a plea agreement has been\nbreached, that the Olano framework should be followed,\nand that one component of the plain-error showing in\nthis context should require a defendant who did not\nobject to a breach in the district court to show a\nreasonable probability that the outcome of the\nproceeding was affected by the breach.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just to explore the issue\nof breach for a moment, suppose hypothetically, same\nfacts here, but it is all vented and discussed and aired\nand objected to in the district court.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The defense attorney says,\nwell, now, if you look at paragraph 8 and so forth, and\nthe government says, well, Your Honor, well, he\ncommitted another crime. And then the judge says -- and\nwe are not going to move for the recommendation. And\nthe judge says: I will assume that you made the\nrecommendation, and I will just tell you right now I\nwouldn't take the recommendation anyway. I'm not\ngoing -- I wouldn't give a lowered sentence even if you\nmade the objection. What result?\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well, I think the result\nthere is controlled by Santobello.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it? Because in\nSantobello there was no reason given for the prosecutor\nto violate the plea agreement. Here there's a good\nreason. Can you distinguish Santobello on that basis?\nMS. SCHERTLER: I would -- I would -- I\nwould seek to distinguish Santobello. As we say in our\nbrief, there seemed to have been multiple problems going\non in Santobello. And in -- and it was unclear that the\ndistrict court in Santobello even knew what the terms of\nthe agreement were.\nThis court -- a court in that situation\nwould have been aware -- would have sorted through what\nthe terms of the agreement were. Now -- and -- and, we\ndon't believe that there is a reason not to apply\nharmless error review in this context as there is in any\nother context.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Excuse me, were you --\nJustice Kennedy, were you through? I'm sorry, I thought\nyou started a question again.\nThe problem I have with the harmless error\nsuggestion that you've made is this. If the government\ndoes engage in some breach of the agreement, it seems to\nme the consequence is that an individual has given up a\ntrial and as a consequence of that has given up liberty,\nwithout either the trial that he is entitled to or\nfulfillment of the conditions for giving up the liberty.\nAnd isn't there -- isn't there a very high\nvalue to be placed on the fact that nobody in the United\nStates under the constitutional guarantees should be --\nshould be sitting behind bars without either a\nconviction following full trial, invocation of whatever\nrights he wants to invoke, or a voluntary agreement to\nbe behind bars? And -- and when neither of those\nconditions is fulfilled, don't we have an error that as\na matter of constitutional law cannot be regarded as\nharmless.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well, there -- certainly I\nagree, Justice Souter, that -- and although there is\ndistinguishable facts in Santobello, that that theme is\npresent in Santobello as well. And the Court there said\nthat it was not -- at the very least, the Court said\nwhen the government has not fulfilled its promise and an\nobjection is raised and the defendant has suffered an\nadverse consequence that was somehow related to the\ngovernment's broken promise, that the Court is not going\nto find harmlessness simply based on the district\ncourt's statement itself that it didn't rely on what the\ngovernment had said.\nNow, we would submit, however, that there\ncould be cases -- and the Chief Justice's hypothetical\nwould have one of those -- where even in a setting where\nan objection is raised, if the defendant receives the\nbenefit that was the aim of the promise he secured from\nthe government -- for instance, if in Santobello the\ndefendant there received the lowest possible sentence\nthat he might have gotten -- that in that circumstance,\nSantobello should not preclude harmless error review,\nand the defendant cannot be said to have -- to be in\njail having not received the benefit.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I think I would agree\nwith you there because, by whatever means, the defendant\nhas gotten everything the defendant bargained for.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Yes, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It may have come by a more\ncircuitous route, but he got it all.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But in the case when,\nunlike the Chief Justice's hypothetical, when we don't\nknow that, when we -- the judge sort of keeps his\nthoughts to himself or herself, then don't we have the\n-- the problem of the -- the individual behind bars,\nneither as a result of trial nor as a result of the deal\nthat he made?\nMS. SCHERTLER: I agree that is -- that is\nthe strong suggestion of Santobello when there has been\nan objection made. We would -- we would submit to the\nCourt that the analysis must differ when no objection is\nmade in the district court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't -- whether we\naccept that proposition or not that the analysis must\ndiffer, doesn't that really depend on -- on what value\nwe place on the importance of the proposition that I\nstarted with? If somebody's behind bars, it's either as\na result of a valid conviction after trial or a\nvoluntary agreement that says, yeah, I will stay there.\nAnd if -- if we place a very high value on the liberty\ninterest -- in -- in retaining liberty except under\nthose two conditions, then isn't it fair to us -- isn't\nit sensible for us to say even in a plain-error\nsituation, we are going to recognize this -- this kind\nof prejudice, despite the fact that he didn't object?\nIf we place a high value on the liberty interest, we\nwouldn't accept your position; isn't that fair?\nMS. SCHERTLER: The high value that the\nCourt placed on the liberty interest in that situation\nwould also have to be to the exclusion of other very\nimportant interests that are served by making sure that\nobjections are raised in the district court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You are right, there is no\nquestion about it. If -- we are saying we will take\na -- a less efficient process, a process less efficient\nperhaps even for getting at the truth, because we think\nthe liberty interest is that important. You are\nentirely right.\nMS. SCHERTLER: I -- and -- but I also would\nadd on to that that I don't think it is only efficiency,\nthat that is the sole interest that would be sacrificed\nby an -- by an absolutist approach, really, that Your\nHonor has suggested. There also would be interests,\nfairness interests, that would be compromised by that\nrule, because just a rule that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Will you give me an\nexample?\nMS. SCHERTLER: Yes, yes. The rule that\nPetitioner proposes, for example, is that when a\ngovernment breach occurs, one need not object in the\ndistrict court, one may raise it on direct appeal and\none automatically gets to elect to withdraw the plea.\nThat would create incentives on the part of defendants\nto -- to withhold objections.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No -- no question, but it\nseems to me that the answer to that is, it's an\nincentive that would never come into play if the\ngovernment kept its word.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So why -- why should -- why\nis the government really in a position to object to\nthat?\nMS. SCHERTLER: Because this Court has\nthe -- what it permits is manipulation of the system by\n-- by counsel, really.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're talking about\nmanipulation of the system. I just wonder if the\ngovernment wasn't manipulating the system when they said\nwe should grant cert in this case. You did -- you did\nagree that the cert should be granted.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Oh, we did acquiesce, yes.\nYes, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And are you taking the\nposition that -- that every case, that the absence of\nobjection would always be controlling?\nMS. SCHERTLER: The --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: For example, in this\nparticular case, it seems to me that if the -- if you\nhad an objection and if the judge had agreed with the\nobjection and said I will set aside the plea because of\nadopting the arguments of your opponent, I think the\ngovernment would have appealed, and said that that\ndecision is so wrong and it's because it's really\nharmless error. I think here the real question is\nwhether there's harmless error available, rather than\nturning anything on whether or not an objection was made\nin the district court.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well, but this -- this is\nthe question on which the circuits had divided, and\nwhich is why we acquiesced in this case to sort through\nthat question.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But in talking about the\ndivision of the circuits, do you think all breaches of\n-- of plea agreements should be governed by precisely\nthe same standard? Or do you think there are varying\nfacts in different cases?\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well, I think that the\nanalysis of a breach in each case will differ and it\nfirst and it will in the -- first and foremost depend\nupon what the standard of appellate review is and\nwhether an objection has preserved, in which case it\nwould be the government's burden to show that a breach\nis harmless, or in the plain-error sentencings the --\nthe burdens are reversed; and we think the -- the\nordinary rules codified in rule 52(a) and (b) apply in\nthis context equally.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's clear, isn't\nit, that the defendant in this case was in fact\nprejudiced? The judge -- Judge Sanders said it's very\nrare, he said, that you would depart -- or I\nforget whether it's depart or --\nMS. SCHERTLER: So rare as to be unknown.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So rare -- I thought\nhe said \"rare to unknown,\" \"to be unknown\" -- you are\nright.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I suspect it's\nprobably rarer still for the government to recommend\nthat. So you can't really say that he wouldn't have\ndone this or he certainly wouldn't have considered it.\nIt's one thing to say I've never heard of that. It's\nanother thing when one of your colleagues is there\nsaying, this is what you should do.\nMS. SCHERTLER: The -- let me respond to\nthat immediate point. Which is -- my response would be,\nyes, if the government were to recommend that he\nreceived acceptance of responsibility in this situation,\nthat may be considered significant; but the district\ncourt judge would also know that it was in fulfillment\nof a promise that was made before renewed criminal\nactivity occurred from jail. And so, given that\ncircumstance --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but none of us\ncan know what the judge would have done. I mean, we\nhave had cases here where the government's\nrecommendation of downward departures has been pretty\nsurprising to me as well, and it's because they were\ninformants or whatever and they have engaged in some\npretty bad conduct; and I don't know what Judge Sanders\nwould have done.\nMS. SCHERTLER: And here under the plain\nerror standard it was the defendant's burden to show a\nreasonable probability that something different would\nhave happened. The court of appeals made findings on\nthis record that the record showed that nothing\ndifferent would have happened, even had the government\ncomplied with its promise.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Looking at this, why can't\nwe say the following? Some circuits have said that they\nwill never recognize plain error, when it's a breach of\na plea agreement. That's wrong. It could be plain\nerror like any other kind of a case, every other kind of\nissue. Sure. But the error here isn't plain. On the\none hand, all they did, the promise was the government\nagreed to request that his sentence be placed at the\nlowest end, and they followed it. In the other part\nthey made no promise. They simply agreed that he had\ndemonstrated acceptance of responsibility. And then\nwhat they did at the trial, they said, \"we don't want\nhim to get acceptance of responsibility at this point.\"\nNow, some people could argue that here is an\nimplicit promise in paragraph 1, not to say something at\nthe trial that is contrary to their recognition in\nparagraph 8. That's where it is. On the other hand,\nyou could argue that there is implicit, also, a promise\nnot to implicitly do the first implicit, if what he has\ndone in the meantime is commit another serious crime.\nSo we have two arguments, one of which says\nthey committed error, and one of which says they didn't\ncommit error; and the argument turns on two implicit\nreadings of paragraph 8. Therefore, it is not plain.\nEnd of case. What's wrong with that?\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well, the -- the government\nhas conceded, and I don't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, the\ngovernment would like a whole lot of questions answered.\nSo what I don't see is how the government can come here\nbecause they want a lot of questions answered, and get\nus to take the case, which I'm not sure was a wonderful\nidea; maybe it was. But then we take the case, and now\nthey want us to say, no, no, don't take the obvious\nresponse to it because we would like you to answer five\nother questions.\nSo what I want to know is, what's wrong with\nwhat I said? Is that a possible outcome?\nMS. SCHERTLER: That is a possible outcome,\nJustice Breyer, and clarification for -- from this Court\nthat the plain-error standard does apply to this type of\nerror as it does to others would certainly help to\nresolve the conflict that does exist out there in the\ncourts of appeal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I may have gotten\nlost in the dialogue. As you understand it,\nJustice Breyer's suggestion was that you win, right?\nYou get plain error, and then sometimes you apply it and\nit comes out one way, and sometimes you apply it the\nother.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Yes. Yes, Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are happy to\ngo along that.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Yes. The -- it does not\ngive the courts all of the guidance that would be\nhelpful as to how to apply other components of the\nplain-error standard in this context.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's a big\ndifference, right? As you said earlier, harmless error,\nthe government has the burden; plain error, the\ndefendant has the burden. That's certainly going to\nchange how you approach however many different factual\ncontexts.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well, yes, Mr. Chief\nJustice. I mean, what -- the reason that this case\nseemed to us a good vehicle to address these questions\nis that they was agreement throughout the appellate\nprocess that there was an error that was plain and,\ntherefore, it provides an opportunity to address -- if\nthe Court chooses, which it need not, but if the Court\nchooses -- to address how the substantial rights aspect\nof the plain-error standard and discretionary aspect --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that the\ngovernment has tried to pick a case in which it has the\nstrongest opportunity to win on the merits in order to\nhave us decide a rule that really isn't important in a\nlot of other cases, but it is totally unimportant in\nthis case.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well, Justice Stevens, what\none finds when one looks through a lot of these -- when\nthese cases are brought, there often is a dispute and a\nreal -- and a genuine dispute as to whether a breach has\noccurred or not. And those cases, of course, do not\nallow exposition -- explanation about the other\ncomponents.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But don't you think it\nwould have been open to the government to make the\nargument that Justice Breyer has made and said there\nreally wasn't a breach here, at least an insignificant\nbreach that should be ignored?\nMS. SCHERTLER: As we acknowledge in our\nbrief, there might be arguments out there that there\nwere implicit terms to this plea agreement that were\nbreached by the defendant. Those arguments were never\nmade in the court of appeals in this case, and so we are\naccepting that record as a way --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They can only get -- they\ncan only get your breach if they find an implicit\nagreement. The implicit agreement is that you will not\ntell the court that, in light of changes, paragraph 8 no\nlonger describes the situation. You didn't breach\nparagraph 8, as taken literally. You agree he had shown\nthat acceptance of responsibility. What you told the\ncourt was, now we don't think he should have this\nacceptance of responsibility, which previously he had\nshown, because he's committed another crime. Those are\nthe exact words you said to the court.\nNow, he may have made an implicit not to do\nthat. On the other hand, that implicit promise may be\nnegative by, you know, the other implicit acceptance of\nthe fact that this applies only where we don't commit\nanother crime.\nSo I'm just saying this -- I'm not saying\nyou are even right. I'm just saying, having those two\narguments, it seems that you aren't plainly wrong. You\naren't plainly wrong. So how do I get to the other\nquestions if I believe that? Do I say, \"Hypothetically\nif the error here were plain, which I think it isn't,\nthen I'd like to tell you where the burden of proof\nlies.\"? By the way, if I happened to think that that's\nwhatever it is, then I will go into a few other things.\nThat's really what I feel you are asking me to do\nbecause I don't think it's plain. Maybe the other\npeople think it's plain.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well, I mean -- as I've --\nas I've already indicated, having the Court state that\nthe -- Rule 52(b) applies here is a -- is a -- I think,\na helpful --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's plain. What\nabout paragraph 9? Are you ignoring paragraph 9?\nJUSTICE BREYER: You fulfilled paragraph 9,\ndidn't you?\nMS. SCHERTLER: The -- paragraph 9 indicates\nthat the government agrees to request that Puckett's\nsentence placed at the lowest end of the guideline\nlevels deemed applicable by the court. And there has\nbeen no claim, at any point in this proceeding, that\nthat provision has been breached. What happened at the\nsentencing was that the district court stated on the\nrecord: I know that there is an agreement in here that\nthat the lowest end of the guideline is appropriate, and\nI intend to follow that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think it's very\nclear that there has been a breach here. And it's not\nfanciful to say he felt remorse and then he went and did\nit again. That happens all the time.\nYou know, when I have a rich dessert I\nshouldn't have, I feel bad about it afterwards. It\ndoesn't mean I will not do it again. I mean, why isn't\nthat the case here?\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well, I -- I guess that it's\na matter of some disagreement, but -- I mean, we have --\nwe have taken the position that this was a breach of the\ngovernment's agreement that he qualified for a\nthree-level reduction in his offense level. That was\nthe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you can put that\nbefore the judge. You are supposed to go there and say,\n\"Look, we agreed to recommend it and we do recommend\nit.\" You could say, \"And by the way, you should know\nthat he's gone out and done this again.\" But you most\n-- you certainly prejudiced him by not doing what you\nsaid you would do.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well, we breached the\nagreement by not doing what we said we would do, and the\nquestion we would submit to the Court is whether, given\nthe absence of an objection, Petitioner carried his\nburden of showing that we did prejudice him. And the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but isn't it the\nfact that we can never know what Judge Sanders would\nhave done if the government had what it said it would\ndo. And because -- why shouldn't you bear the burden of\nshowing there is no prejudice when you can't tell\nbecause you're the one that breached the agreement?\nMS. SCHERTLER: Because in the plain-error\nsetting, this Court has made clear that the burdens\nshift and that, under the third component of that\nstandard, it is the defendant's burden, if he did not\nobject, to show an effect on the outcome of the\nproceeding, that his substantial rights were violated.\nAnd here -- and I would note that the court\nof appeals made findings that the result would have been\nthe same, and Petitioner in this Court has never\nchallenged those findings on this record.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you say just for me,\nbecause I am changing a little bit here in light of that\nquestion, but what is it precisely that the government\nsaid it would do that it did not do?\nMS. SCHERTLER: The -- paragraph 8 of the\nplea agreement indicates that the government --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What does it say? What are\nthe words that it says the government did not do?\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well, we indicated to the\ndistrict court that Petitioner did not qualify for\nacceptance of responsibility. And paragraph 8 was a\ngovernment agreement that he did qualify for acceptance\nof responsibility.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So he did agree. \"We\nagreed that he does qualify.\" And then when you got to\nthe court, you said, now we don't agree that he\nqualifies at this point.\nMS. SCHERTLER: That's correct. And there\nwas -- and there an intervening event, obviously, that\naffected the judgment, but because the explicit\nprovision of this particular plea agreement, which I\nagree is atypical, as the government's motion for the\nthird point made clear, did not have a qualification in\nthere. And that -- that is the base -- I mean, I don't\nmean to be arguing strenuously that the government did\nsomething wrong here, because there were -- but the fact\nis, given the terms of this plea agreement, there --\nthat is the basis for our concession that there was a\nbreach.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As a matter of practice\namong U.S. attorneys, we do have six and a half years at\nstake here, right? That's the difference between the\ntwo levels? Why wouldn't it be the appropriate thing\nfor the U.S. attorney, the assistant U.S. attorney, to\nsay, \"Judge, I want to call your attention to paragraph\n8 of the plea agreement. At the time we entered into\nit, we made that undertaking.\" And so then everybody is\nsure that the judge's mind is focused on that. Wouldn't\nthat be the better practice?\nMS. SCHERTLER: Absolutely,\nJustice Ginsburg, and if there had been an objection\nbased on that provision of the plea agreement, that may\nhave been very well what would have happened. The\nbreach could have been cured. And the fact is that, in\nthe absence of that objection, the breach was not cured\nwhen it could have been, and that is one reason -- that\nis why it makes sense to apply the plain-error standard\nin this context.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, could the breach have\nbeen cured? I mean, the point -- it seems to me, the\npoint at which the defendant would have known that the\ngovernment had breached the agreement was when the\ngovernment stood there before the court and said, \"In\nfact, he hasn't accepted responsibility. He went out\nand committed another crime while he was behind bars.\"\nIt seems to me that that's the point -- and\nmaybe this phrase occurred somewhere in the record --\nthat that's a bell that you can't unring. For the\ndefendant to get up and object and said, \"Wait a minute,\nwere you supposed to represent to the court that you\nagreed that I did accept responsibility\" -- to require\nthe government to fulfill that undertaking at that point\nwould have been ridiculous. I suppose the U.S. attorney\ncould have said, \"Oh, yes, he's right, Judge. We agreed\nthat he accepted responsibility.\" But the U.S. attorney\nhas already just said a moment before, \"He hasn't. We\nreally don't mean that at all.\"\nThere's no way, it seems to me, that there\ncould have been a better outcome in a case like this,\neven if the objection had been contemporary.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well, there would be more\nthan one way to cure a breach such as this, if an\nobjection had been raised in the district court. One\nway would have been by the correction on the record that\nwe have just discussed, but another way --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Which would have been\nsilly.\nMS. SCHERTLER: But if the defendant -- and\nif the defendant said that, that would be a silly way to\ncorrect it. It also could have been sent to another\njudge for resentencing, just as the Court in Santobello\nsaid, that a remedy could be accomplished.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was sent to another\njudge, that judge would still have the presentence\nreport. After all, it wasn't the government that\ninitiated reneging on the -- if it was the -- it was the\npresentence report. And before the government said a\nword, the judge had read and was discussing the\npresentence report, which said, judge, earlier, we said\nyou should give credit for acceptance of\nresponsibilities, now we must tell you, you should not.\nMS. SCHERTLER: The probation officer said\nthat.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Yes. And I don't think\nPetitioner -- Petitioner even contends that he is\nentitled now -- or he contends he is entitled to get out\nof this plea. But taking the more typical remedies that\nthis Court proposed as one possibility in Santobello, I\ndon't think Petitioner would say that a judge should not\nknow that he did -- that he engaged in subsequent\ncriminal conduct. That is information that any judge\nsentencing him must know about in order to fairly assess\nwhat sentence he should receive.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe Judge Sanders\nwould look at this kind of the way that we have been\ndiscussing it, and he would look and say, boy, it's --\nit's -- he committed subsequent conduct, how can you\nrecommend that I depart? He says, but on the other\nhand, every plea agreement I have seen you always say if\nhe commits subsequent conduct that is illegal, that all\nbets are the off. You didn't say that here, so I'm\ngoing to take the recommendation seriously.\nI don't think it's -- maybe I am repeating\nmyself, but I don't think it is at all clear that the\nresult wouldn't be different here.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Well -- and again, I guess I\nwould give the same response, that it -- it is\nPetitioner's burden to show a likelihood, a reasonable\nlikelihood that it would have been different.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: With respect, that is not\nwhat Olano says, is it? The -- the -- the basic Olano\nstandard is a -- is a violation of substantial rights\nstandard.\nMS. SCHERTLER: Yes, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And one way that you could\nshow a violation of substantial rights would be a -- a\ndemonstration that the outcome would have been\ndifferent. But another possibility of showing that\nviolation is -- is whether -- and I know you don't\naccept it, but it's the one that I proposed earlier,\nthere is a violation of substantial rights if somebody\nis sitting behind bars without having gotten there by\nthe performance of an agreement that he made, or as a\nresult of a trial. And that, too, could satisfy the\nOlano formulation, could it not?\nMS. SCHERTLER: It could, Justice Souter.\nAnd if the Court were to take that position, we would\nargue that there is still, under the plain-error\nstandard, the fourth component, the discretionary\ncomponent --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know you want to -- as I\npoint out one other thing to you. I think it's a hard\nquestion, burden of proof and these other things, that I\njust turned the page, after the person, Ms. Simms, she's\nthe prosecutor, and she's absolutely clear to me, others\ncan disagree, that this judge knew just what the\ngovernment had agreed to, and the prosecutor was saying\nthat now things have changed.\nAnd then the judge turns to the probation\nofficer, and the probation officer says, just to\nreiterate what Ms. Simms said, the new offense,\naccording to the guidelines of the guideline manual,\nprohibits any acceptance of responsibility. Now, if\nthat turns out to be right, of course, it couldn't\nmatter less whose burden of proof it is.\nMS. SCHERTLER: It was not correct, as a\nmatter of fact, and the defense attorney made that\ncorrection, and the -- and the judge accepted that. And\nif I could go back --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He wasn't -- was he\nconvicted of this new crime?\nMS. SCHERTLER: He -- not at the time of\nthese proceedings.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It was just an\nallegation, right?\nMS. SCHERTLER: That's right. Another --\nanother defendant had pled guilty to this crime, and the\nfactual statement supporting his plea had implicated\nPetitioner as having instigated the crime, suggested\nto --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did we assume\nanything anyway? I assume he denies the allegations.\nMS. SCHERTLER: He admitted the allegations\nto the probation officer, and that is what was reflected\nin the presentence report.\nAnd if I could return to Justice Souter's\nquestion about if the Court were to take the position\nthat a form of substantial rights is affected in every\ncase of a government breach of plea agreement, we would\nrespectfully submit that as this Court analyzed a\nsimilar type of difficult question in Johnson and\nCotton, that the fourth discretionary component of the\nstandard should preclude relief or should at least give\nthe district court, the court of appeals discretion to\nnot grant relief where, as in this case, there has been\nno showing that there was an effect on the outcome, and,\nas the Court of Appeals found, an affirmative record\nthat the outcome would have been exactly the same.\nThank you, Your Honors. We would ask that\nthe judgment be affirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Isaacson, why don't you take two\nminutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LARS R. ISAACSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ISAACSON: Thank you, Your Honor.\nThe problem that the Puckett panel had in\nthe third prong of 52(b) they focused on whether or not\nthere is prejudice at sentencing. That was the focus of\nthe Puckett panel. That is why they said 52(b) plain\nerror applied and was found in that case.\nThe problem with that is that Santobello\nclearly points out that prejudice to the trial judge,\nthat the trial judge -- what the trial judge would have\ndone is simply not relevant. That is why 52(b) cannot\nbe applied in this case.\nSecondly, when the government argues that\nthere is no prejudice -- you have to show prejudice at\nsentencing, the judge would have done something\ndifferent, that is virtually an impossible standard.\nUnder 18 U.S.C. 355 -- there are a number of factors a\nsentencing judge has to take into. The idea -- and\nthere is many different factors they must look at, all\nof these different things.\nThe idea that a defendant can somehow show a\njudge would have come to a different result but for the\ngovernment breach is an impossibility.\nThe final point I would make is, the\nargument the government is making now about prejudice,\nit would make no difference at all if the defendant had\nobjected at the time. If there is no effect on\nsentencing, it would not pass muster under plain-error\nor the harmless error standards. So the next case that\nis going to come before this Court is when you have an\nobjection, and then they're going to say the exact same\nargument here.\nWe would ask you to reverse the decision of\nthe Fifth Circuit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
