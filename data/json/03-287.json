        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We'll now hear argument in\nWilkinson against Dotson.\nSolicitor Cole.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. COLE: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nPrisoners typically want two things: first, to\nimprove their conditions while in prison; and second, to\nget out of prison as quickly as possible. Respondents'\nclaims here are not conditions claims. They do not seek a\nlarger cell or better food while in prison. Rather, their\nclaims are about getting out of prison.\nTraditional understandings of habeas would\nsuggest that these release-driven claims lie there, not in\nsection 1983, and this Court's decision in Heck confirms\nthat this common sense answer is also the correct answer.\nIn fact, Heck establishes two bars, each of which\nindependently prevent respondents from using section 1983\nto pursue their claims here.\nFirst, Heck establishes that civil actions under\nsection 1983 cannot be used to collaterally attack State\ncriminal judgments. Before a prisoner can advance a claim\nunder section 1983 that would necessarily imply the\ninvalidity of such a judgment, he must first show that it\nhas been favorably terminated. And Edwards v. Balisok\nconfirms that quasi-judicial administrative decisions\nregarding the duration of confinement count as criminal\njudgments for this purpose.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it isn't just duration of\n-- of confinement. I mean, in -- in Balisok, what you had\nwas a determination that the confinement would be\ndefinitely less as a result of the -- the good time\nscheme. The -- the gut notion behind Balisok was that\nwhat you were attacking would imply that the sentence\nitself was invalid because the conviction was and so on.\nWe don't have that here. What we have here is a\nscheme that makes a -- a sentence that is imposed a more\ndefinite sentence. We know where in the range it's going\nto be reconsidered. And however that may be classified,\nit's not simply a Balisok situation.\nMR. COLE: It's arguably different than the\ngood-time credits at issue in Balisok, as -- as Your Honor\nnotes. However, I -- I would suggest that even with\nrespect to good-time credits, often under many State\nsystems, good-time credits have the dual effect of moving\nup the parole eligibility date, as well as potentially --\nand in some States, it doesn't even have an effect on\nthe --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right, but that had --\nMR. COLE: -- of the sentence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- that had nothing to do with\nthe rationale in Balisok, as I recall it. Isn't that\ncorrect?\nMR. COLE: Your Honor, the -- the Court --\nthat's -- that's correct, yes. And I guess what I'd --\nI'd say is that what seemed to be driving the Court,\nthough, was still the durational aspect of the sentence;\nthat is, as the Court said in Muhammad, if a claim\nthreatens no consequence for the duration of confinement,\nthen that isn't a -- or that isn't a claim that should be\nbrought in 1983.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No -- no question. But the\ndurational consequence in those cases was a definite\nconsequence of longer duration, i.e., a sentence in the\nfirst place, a sentence not reduced by good time in -- in\nthe second example. Here, there -- there is no such clear\nconsequence. Here, the consequence is that there will\nsimply be a period of time before a sentence already\nimposed will be reviewed to determine whether, in fact, it\nwill be shortened or allowed to run. And that's\ndifferent.\nMR. COLE: I'm not sure it is, Your Honor. Both\nof them are going to have definite durational consequences\nfor confinement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No -- no question about that.\nAt -- at the level of whether there is a durational\nconsequence, they -- they both have it. I -- I grant you\nthat.\nMR. COLE: And, Your Honor, as far back as\nPreiser, this Court has noted that challenges to duration\ngo to the very heart of habeas corpus. That's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The duration of -- of the\nsentence. And here, there's no implication at all that\nthis sentence is in any way invalid, that the sentence\nitself or any portion of it is invalid because the parole\nwould be a matter of administrative grace, but it doesn't\n-- the determination of parole eligibility or parole\nsuitability does not go to the validity of the sentence in\nany way, shape, or manner. Does it?\nMR. COLE: Well, a decision from a Federal court\n-- and I guess -- I think the answer to Your -- Your\nHonor's question is yes, it does. And the reason I say\nthat is I think we need to look to the consequences of the\nFederal court decision that would follow from the claims\nthat -- that the plaintiffs -- or I'm sorry -- the\nprisoners here are advancing.\nThe State of Ohio has made individualized\ndecisions with respect to each of these respondents that\nthey should not again be considered for release from\nprison until 2005. The request -- the relief that they're\nrequesting and the claims that they're bringing, if\nsuccessful, would result in the Federal court undermining\nthat State decision with regard to the length that they\nshould be incarcerated. It goes directly to the -- the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't -- it doesn't\nshorten the length that they're going to be incarcerated.\nThere -- there is no certainty that -- that if they win\nthis action, they will be incarcerated for a lesser\nperiod, is there?\nMR. COLE: Absolutely no certainty of that, Your\nHonor. But there is certainty --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and there was in the\nother cases, wasn't there? In Balisok.\nMR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, I don't think so.\nI mean, prisoners could be released in the State of\nWashington before the terminus of their sentence. They\nmight not -- it isn't as though they had to serve all the\nway till the end, less whatever good-time credits they\nhad. They could easily be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but --\nMR. COLE: -- released prior to that time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, indeed, but the -- but --\nbut getting the good-time credits entitled them to be --\nbe released earlier. They might have been released even\nearlier still, but their entitlement to be released\nearlier was a consequence, wasn't it?\nMR. COLE: It was, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And there is no entitlement to\nbe released earlier as a consequence of this.\nMR. COLE: We --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You just get another hearing\nand maybe you will, maybe you won't.\nMR. COLE: That's correct. You'll -- you'll\njust get another hearing. But an important note on that:\nyou'll get another hearing, and you'll get another hearing\nsooner than the State has decided that you should get a\nhearing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's true. So it makes\nit possible that you'll get released earlier, but -- but\nthere's no assurance you'll -- really, the crucial\nquestion for me, I think, is whether -- whether this could\nhave been brought as a habeas action. Could this have\nbeen brought as a habeas action?\nMR. COLE: Yes, Your Honor, it could have been\nbrought as a habeas action. If you look at the nature of\ntheir complaints, they're -- they're clearly in custody.\nHabeas would require custody and violation of the\nConstitution of the United States.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they're just asking for a\nnew hearing. They're not asking for an earlier release.\nWhat's your closest case that -- that would allow a habeas\naction which does not seek an earlier release but just --\njust a hearing?\nMR. COLE: I think probably the Garlotte case,\nYour Honor, in which the Court allowed a habeas challenge\nwhere the only result was going to be to advance the date\nof eligibility for release from prison incarceration.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. But it -- No, go on.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it -- it doesn't advance the\ndate of eligibility. It advances the date at which the\nparole board will take another look. The only eligibility\nis an eligibility to take -- to have another look taken and\nnot an eligibility for release.\nMR. COLE: That's true, Your Honor, but these --\nunder that understanding of eligibility, where eligibility\nmeans the first possible release date. But these\nprisoners are not eligible for release in the sense of\nit's not going to happen for them unless and until the\nnext release hearing.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if they are subject to\nanother look, they are not necessarily then eligible for\nrelease. And I think that's the point that we're getting\n-- let me -- let me ask a -- a sort of complementary\nquestion.\nIs there any reason that these --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is this with an I or an E?\nMR. COLE: I was hoping for an I, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: With an I or an E?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: With an E. With an E. But if\n-- if you take my questioning as a compliment with an I,\nthat's perfectly okay too.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. COLE: I'll -- I'll wait and see what the\nquestion is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let's see what it is.\nThe -- the question is, could these claims not\nhave been brought in advance of any application to these\nparticular prisoners of the revised -- whatever they were\n-- the 1998 guidelines? And if the answer is yes, then\nthey could be brought at a time when, I suppose, habeas\nwould -- would not have been a possible remedy. Is -- is\n-- am I correct on those two points?\nMR. COLE: The State concedes that if they had\nbrought this case before a parole hearing at which the\nguidelines were applied, that it would be a different\ncase, and that 1983 would be a remedy in that -- in that\nsituation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Here's -- here's the difficulty\nthat I -- that I have. When I read your brief, I thought,\nwell, he must be right because this is really about\ncustody. It's really about custody. They want to get out\neventually.\nBut then when I -- I -- when I went back to\nBalisok, I thought, oh, here's the problem. The problem\nis that it's a damage remedy in Balisok. And normally you\nwant the person to go into 1983 to get damages. But he's\ngoing to get mixed up. When do you send him to habeas?\nWell, we don't want to send him to habeas unless it's\nclear that habeas should have been brought. And so if\nhe's just challenging, for example, introduction of Fourth\nAmendment violation evidence or something like that, don't\ngot to habeas. Don't go to habeas. You didn't have to go\nto habeas unless you had to, unless you had -- unless it\nwas necessary to upset the conviction. You see? That's\nwhy that language is there. Now, I got that far.\nThen I said, oh, I see what you do. We should\nhave one rule for damages. Well, that makes sense. But\nthere's no reason not to have a different rule when you\nhave the injunctive action, and there maybe we could\nfollow your rule.\nBut the next thing I come across is a statement\nthat says, no, no, the rule is the same whether you bring\na damage action or whether you bring an injunctive or\ndeclaratory relief action. And I said, well, why did we\nwrite that? You know, we're the ones who caused all this\ntrouble. But the -- the -- well, because we didn't want\nto make it too complicated and -- and not have all the\nquestions coming, well, what kind of an action is it\nreally, et cetera.\nOkay. So once I got that far, I said, oh, well,\nI'm going to have to change something for you to win.\nEither I have to change the thing that says the damages\nshould be the same as the injunctive, or I have to change\nsomething else somewhere along the line, the word\nnecessary. I don't want to change the word necessary.\nMaybe I could change the other, but why bother really?\nBecause all that's important here is people know which way\nthey should go.\nNow, that's where I am at the moment, thinking\ngive him his 1983 action. It's simpler. It follows from\nBalisok. Why not?\nMR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, there would be some\nreal consequences that would follow from that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what I thought.\nMR. COLE: The reason that it's important that\nthese cases go to habeas rather than 1983 is because of\nthe State court exhaustion requirement that's attendant\nwith habeas. Parole claims like those advanced here are\noften, if not always, intricately bound up with State law\nissues, and the State law is often going to provide much\nmore meaningful relief than the Federal law claims that\nthe prisoners advance.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't the Prison Litigation\nReform Act require exhaustion even in a 1983 action?\nMR. COLE: Yes, but as Your Honor is aware,\nthat's an administrative exhaustion requirement which this\nCourt referred to in Nelson, I believe, as a substantially\nlower gate than the exhaustion requirement imposed by\nhabeas.\nMoreover, it's telling --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is -- may -- may I just follow\nup on that question? At the administrative level, cannot\nthese State law policies perfectly well be taken into\nconsideration? In other words, your argument was these\nthings are bound up with State law issues and the best\nplace to have them resolved is -- is in a State forum.\nThey can be resolved in a State administrative forum,\ncan't they?\nMR. COLE: They could, Your Honor, but I -- I\nthink the types of legal determinations with respect to\nlegal entitlements and also the court -- we would assume a\nState court would also consider Federal claims that might\nbe made by the prisoners when they bring their State court\nclaim. Those types of legal claims are better resolved by\nState courts. They have the expertise to make the -- the\ndetermination. And in fact, in Ohio --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, couldn't one say the\nsame thing of prison conditions that you can bring in as a\n1983 action? The States know better about how their\nprisons are operating and what changes would have to be\nmade. So I -- I think that you -- you may be right that\nthe State knows more about how its parole system operates,\nbut so does it know more about how its prison system\noperates. And that doesn't -- that's not what determines\nwhether you have 1983 or habeas.\nMR. COLE: Well, but Congress, with respect to\nconditions claims -- and if you look at the language of\nthe administrative exhaustion requirement in the PLRA at\n42 U.S.C. 1997(e)(a), it says no action shall be brought\nwith respect to prison conditions under 1983 without\nadministrative exhaustion. So even Congress, in thinking\nabout the PLRA and in thinking about requiring\nadministrative exhaustion, understood that 1983 is really\nabout conditions of confinement. 1983 isn't about -- it\nnever has been about -- release.\nHabeas has traditionally been the relief that\npeople -- or the cause of action that people bring when\nwhat they're interested in is relief -- or release from\nprison. And these claims, no one can dispute, are\nrelease-driven claims. They may not ultimately be\nsuccessful in securing release, but the prisoners here --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, no, I've got that part.\nBut the -- and -- and you're right about that part. But\nthat -- you know, that doesn't get over the -- the hump\nhere I think because of the -- what we've written.\nThe -- I mean, where I'm coming out now, what\nyou've just said, is well, you know, there's going to be\nexhaustion in both cases. And prison conditions, if we\nsay that habeas doesn't -- that 1983 applies here I think\nprobably -- I can't guarantee it -- but those where prison\nconditions would then cover it, and then there would be\nexhaustion, and there -- where it doesn't seem to make\ndifference there.\nAnd now I'm back to asking the other half of\nthis, which is, well, all right, suppose I say I see your\npoint, I think you're right. Now, what -- what is your\nrecommendation? What do we change? Do we change the word\nnecessary in Balisok, which I'd be pretty reluctant to do?\nOr do we drive a wedge between the damage cases and the\ninjunctive/declaratory relief cases?\nMR. COLE: I don't think you need to do either,\nYour Honor. I think if we go back to Heck and look at the\nlanguage there that talks about necessarily implying the\ninvalidity of a criminal judgment, which is something --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well.\nMR. COLE: -- respondents concede in their\nbrief, the only question then is does a parole decision\ncount as a, quote, criminal --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. No, but then what\nyou're doing is taking the first half because what you're\nreading is you're reading that word necessary, whatever\nthose words were in Balisok that we were just talking\nabout, as your case satisfying that condition. And if\nyour case satisfies that condition, then so does the case\nwhere a person wants to bring a damage action because of\nillegally seized evidence at his trial. Doesn't it? I\nmean, because all -- I mean -- and then we've swept --\nthen we've done -- we've really moved Balisok from what it\nwas trying to do.\nMR. COLE: I don't think that's necessarily\nright, Your Honor, because the illegally seized evidence\nat the trial -- I don't know that that would necessarily\nimply the invalidity of the conviction that resulted from\nthat trial.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why is he bringing his damage\naction? He thinks he's bringing it because what they did\nat that trial hurt me. Now, how did it hurt me? It hurt\nme because I went right to prison.\nMR. COLE: Right, Your Honor, and that -- that's\nabsolutely correct, but I'm not arguing for, and I want to\nmake it very clear that I'm not arguing for any rule that\nwould turn on the subjective intent of the prisoner in\nbringing their claim. It turns on the necessary\nimplication of success on that claim, and that's a -- a\ndistinction that the Court made both in Heck and in\nBalisok. They looked to what's the necessary implication.\nSo we look to the claims here, not why they\nbrought them, but what are the claims. And the claims\nhere, and the particular ones that I would focus on, are\nthe ex post facto claims. If the -- if they have success\non their ex post facto claims -- and we don't believe\ntheir claims are meritorious, but if they're successful on\nthose claims, there's no way the State's decision can\nstand. They are entitled to a new hearing at which they\nwould again be considered for parole --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but does that mean the --\nthe judgment -- the order denying release on parole is\ninvalid? There are really two parts to it. One, you --\nwe're not going to release you. Secondly, your next\nhearing will be at a later date than you want. Insofar as\nyou challenge the date of the hearing -- the date of the\nnext hearing, does that necessarily imply the invalidity\nof the entire order denying parole?\nMR. COLE: We -- we concede that if there's an\nex post facto violation here, these prisoners are entitled\nto a new parole hearing. And I guess the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But they're not entitled to\nparole.\nMR. COLE: Absolutely, Your Honor. Absolutely.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So that it doesn't totally\ninvalidate the order that is at issue.\nMR. COLE: Well, the way that -- that I've been\nthinking about it is if you put the State parole decision\nup on the wall and you put the Federal decision up on the\nwall, one of them has to come down. The Federal decision\ntrumps the State decision. It can --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it doesn't entirely come\ndown. It just -- half of it comes down.\nMR. COLE: No. The whole thing comes down, Your\nHonor. They're entitled both to an immediate new release\nhearing and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But not for release.\nMR. COLE: -- if they're successful on their\nclaims, they're entitled to more frequent release hearings\nin the future. So the decision, the State's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but isn't it true that\none aspect of your order that's under attack is they had\nrefused to grant them parole?\nMR. COLE: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And that remains.\nMR. COLE: It doesn't, Your Honor. They have to\ndecide that again. That -- that order is void ab initio.\nIt's as though it were never entered. They have to make a\nnew decision about whether or not this person should --\nshould have parole and that they cannot in any way -- the\nState cannot rely on the prior decision that they reached\non that issue.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I thought the only relief they\nwere seeking was a more prompt next hearing.\nMR. COLE: No, they -- Dotson's complaint, I\nbelieve at page 20 of the joint appendix -- he wants to,\nquote, proceed toward a prompt and immediate parole\nhearing in accordance with the statutory laws and\nadministrative rules in place when the plaintiff committed\nhis crimes. They want an --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But aren't -- aren't those\nclaims moot or academic now? Because, as I understand it,\nhe has had another parole hearing. So he's -- with the\nhearing that he was seeking, he's already had another. So\nhe's not complaining about the absence of a hearing or --\nor flaws in the procedure at the hearing. I thought that\nthis case now reduces to a clean question about the\nretroactive application of the new guidelines.\nMR. COLE: Well, it isn't a clean question, Your\nHonor, because exactly the same error that he alleges\ninfected his first hearing was present at his second\nhearing. If -- if you look at the materials that they\nadded to their brief at lines 3, 7, and 8 where they have\nthe new parole decision, it's clear that Dotson's 2002\nparole decision was predicated on exactly the same\nguidelines, exactly the same 1998 guidelines that he says\nviolated his rights under the Ex Post Facto Clause.\nSo, in fact, if anything, it's made his\nsituation worse because a Federal decision on his claims\nnow would both necessarily imply the invalidity of his\nprevious hearing and the 2002 hearing, and the 2002\nhearing was a release hearing. Unlike the halfway review\nthat occurred earlier, it was a full-fledged release\nhearing in 2002, at which the parole board decided both\nthat he should not get parole then and that he should not\nagain be considered for parole until 2005.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there -- maybe I'm wrong\nabout this, but I thought there no challenge being made to\nthe 2002 hearing.\nMR. COLE: But what Heck makes clear is it\ndoesn't matter what you say you're challenging. What we\nneed to look to is what's the necessary implication of\nsecuring success on your claims in Federal court for a\nState decision. Here, the necessary implication, if\nthey're successful on their ex post facto claims, is going\nto be that the 2002 decision can't stand, the 1999\ndecision --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why can't it simply be that\nprospectively for this class of prisoner, the old\nguidelines will apply, prospectively without undoing\nanything that's happened in the past?\nMR. COLE: I think for the same reason that in\nBalisok I don't think there could have been a prospective\norder that said -- said something like the method you have\nfor choosing decision-makers creates fraud, bias, and\ndeceit, on a going-forward basis you must change that\nmethod for selecting decision-makers. Saying that you\nhave to change it on a going-forward basis would mean,\nnecessarily imply, that there had been fraud, bias, and\ndeceit by the decision-maker that would mean that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think twice you started\nsomething and our questions impeded you. But I think you\nwere equating the parole board's decision to a criminal\nsentence, and so you -- you were saying just as the -- the\nFederal authority can't come in and nullify the State\ncriminal sentence, neither can it nullify the parole board\ndetermination. And -- and I thought that the comparison\nbetween a -- a sentence -- a criminal conviction and\nsentence and a parole board's discretionary determination\n-- you seemed to be putting those on the same plane.\nMR. COLE: Not exactly on the same plane, Your\nHonor, but recognizing that this Court in Balisok said\nthat post-judgment administrative decisions regarding the\nduration of confinement also count as criminal judgments\nthat are protected for purposes of -- of the Heck\ndoctrine. And in Greenholtz, this Court --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but the -- the\ngenerality at which you keep referring to it, with respect\nto conditions of confinement, is a -- is a higher level of\ngenerality than anything that Balisok decided. In\nBalisok, the particular decision was a decision to revoke\nan entitlement to be released at whatever the date the\ngood time would give, and -- and that is a much more\nspecific -- I mean, that literally affects an entitlement\nto be released. It is not merely a decision with respect\nto length of confinement.\nMR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, if this turns on\nwhether or not it's an entitlement, I would agree with you\nthat it seems good-time credits might be different from an\nentitlement sense than parole.\nBut -- but all the way back, in tracing the\ncases from Preiser forward, the Court has talked about\nduration of confinement, and certainly no one can argue\nthat the decision here is going to have dramatic\nconsequences for the duration of these prisoners'\nconfinement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We -- we don't know what\nconsequence it will have for the duration of his\nconfinement. All we know is that it will have a\nconsequence in determining the date at which the next look\nwill be taken by the parole board to see whether he then\nis in a condition to be released. That's all we can tell.\nMR. COLE: That's correct, Your Honor, but\nthey're -- they're pressing ex post facto claims. And as\nthis point -- Court pointed out in Garner in 2000, they\ncan maybe bring those claims based on changes in frequency\nof parole hearings, but they're going to have to show a\ndefinite impact on the quantum of punishment that they\nreceive as a result of that change. So if they're going\nto be successful on their ex post facto claims, they're\ngoing to have to show an impact on the duration of their\nconfinement. Either they have no ex post facto claim\nbecause there's no durational impact on their --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But you're -- you're\nassuming -- your argument now is assuming that they are\ngoing to be successful on this element, that you say\nthey've got to satisfy later.\nMR. COLE: Right, but that's the Heck --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and whether they are or\nnot has nothing to do with -- with Balisok and Heck.\nMR. COLE: I -- I disagree, Your Honor, because\nin Heck and Balisok, the Court said look to what happens\nif they're successful on their claims. So I'm -- we're --\nthe State is supposed to hypothesize that somehow they're\ngoing to be successful on these claims. We don't agree\nit's going to happen, but once we hypothesize that they're\ngoing to be successful on an ex post facto claim, it means\nthey're going to have to show, have to demonstrate a\ndurational impact on their sentence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. It also -- it also means\nthat if -- if -- assuming your argument is sound, if you\nlose this case, you win the war.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. COLE: At -- at some level, I think there's\nan -- an inherent and fundamental tension in their\nposition, and -- and the coin could flipped and conversely\nthere's that same tension in ours.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are -- are you sure that that's\nwhat they have to prove, that -- a durational impact?\nWouldn't it be enough to show that they were deprived of\nan opportunity to have the sentence shorter? Wouldn't --\nwouldn't it -- assuming there was an ex post facto\nviolation, wouldn't that be enough of an injury, that they\nlost an opportunity to have their sentence shortened?\nMR. COLE: But, Your Honor, I believe what makes\nout the ex post facto claim is an increase in the quantum\nof punishment after they've committed their crimes. So\nthey need to show that as an element.\nI -- I see -- I'd like to reserve the remainder\nof my time for rebuttal, if I could.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You may do so.\nMr. Lewis.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN Q. LEWIS\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT JOHNSON\nMR. LEWIS: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThis case presents a straightforward opportunity\nto apply the Heck rule. Respondent Johnson's section --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell us why -- why is\nit still live when they -- when they already received a\nsecond hearing? Or why is not moot?\nMR. LEWIS: Johnson still has remaining claims\nfor prospective injunctive relief in this case and, as\nwell, declaratory relief. What may be mooted is his claim\nfor retroactive injunctive relief, in other words, a new\nparole hearing. I think in order for him to pursue that\ntype of a claim, he'd have to go back down to the district\ncourt.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what is --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, put in plain language\nwhat it is Johnson is claiming he's entitled to. I don't\nunderstand.\nMR. LEWIS: Well, he -- really three different\nthings. He's requesting prospective injunctive relief,\nfix the due process violations that are going on in Ohio\nparole proceedings.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is a new -- a new parole\nhearing. Isn't -- I mean, it -- I --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: How could that be fixed?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. How -- how can it be\nfixed except by giving him a new parole hearing?\nMR. LEWIS: Well, he does have a class action.\nHe filed a class action and he's trying to fix the\nproceeding prospectively. It doesn't necessarily require\nhim to have a new parole hearing. He's still in\nconfinement and will very likely have a new parole\nhearing, a new parole hearing that he wants the\nproceedings to be different in. He's not necessarily\nasking for a new parole hearing. He's saying --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't he? If -- if -- what\nhe's saying is the past proceedings were invalid, I want\nyou to do it right in the future.\nMR. LEWIS: Sure. I think that was part of his\nclaim, which might be mooted, but he's also saying in any\nfuture --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. It -- it isn't mooted\nbecause he still got it done wrong. The second hearing\nwas still wrong.\nMR. LEWIS: Well, we don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: His claims here -- if his claims\nhere are correct.\nMR. LEWIS: We don't know that for sure, but\npart of his claim as well is to say in future parole\nhearings that I'm going to be subjected to, even if you\ndon't give me a new one, in future parole hearings that\nI'm going to be subjected to, I want these processes fixed\nto -- to come into compliance with due process. And I\nthink that's separate and apart from --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you say we don't know\nwhether the -- the new parole hearing he got was still\ninvalid?\nMR. LEWIS: I don't think there's enough in the\nrecord to determine that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, so we can assume that that\nwas valid. You're -- you're willing to assume that for\npurposes of this case?\nMR. LEWIS: I am not willing to assume that. I\n-- I don't think we can say one way or the other.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well,\nMR. LEWIS: We can't yet.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, fine.\nMR. LEWIS: We may intend to.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then we take it as valid. Then\nwe take it as valid. That's not a claim you're\nchallenging.\nBut I take it your claim is in the year 2009 he\nwill have another hearing.\nMR. LEWIS: Actually 2005.\nJUSTICE BREYER: 2005? Okay, 2005 he'll have\nanother hearing.\nMR. LEWIS: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And in the year 2005, I want\nnot to have the -- what are they called? The 1998\nguidelines. I don't want my 1998 guidelines applied in\nthe 2005 hearing because you have some theory, maybe good,\nmaybe bad, but it's a theory that that would violate the\nConstitution of the United States.\nMR. LEWIS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you're saying he's going to\nhave this. I want an injunction or declaratory relief\nthey can't do it.\nMR. LEWIS: That's right, and as well, he says I\nwant to be heard at this next parole hearing. Now, that\nwas -- part of his due process allegations in this case\nwere that he -- he wasn't even allowed to meaningfully\nparticipate in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And he's saying it violates the\nConstitution in two respects: one, they won't listen to\nme; and two, they apply the 1998 guidelines.\nMR. LEWIS: That's essentially it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's it. Okay. We're\ntalking now about this 2005 hearing and he wants new\nprocedures, and the question is, is this 1983 or is it\nhabeas?\nMR. LEWIS: That's -- that's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. LEWIS: And -- and it is section 1983\nbecause it doesn't violate the Heck rule. This --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And what -- what is your --\nwhat is Johnson's mootness argument?\nMR. LEWIS: Well, to the extent in his complaint\nhe was seeking a new parole hearing as a result of the\nchallenge to the '99 decision, that's probably mooted\nbecause he has received this 2001 hearing and we just\ndon't know enough about it to know whether he's going to\nchallenge it or not. He'd have to amend his complaint in\nthe district court.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Could -- is it possible that\nboth Dotson and Johnson could get new hearings by -- filing\nhabeas --\nMR. LEWIS: I don't think so.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- petition?\nMR. LEWIS: I don't think so. I don't think\nthat Johnson has a Federal habeas remedy here because the\nFederal habeas statute is a challenge to the legality of\ncustody, the legality of confinement, and that's not\nanything that he's challenging in this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What would you do if there was\nan allegation of a serious procedural flaw in a past\nhearing? The parole commission was -- was drunk or they\nread the wrong file or something, and it was just a\nchallenge to the invalidity of the past hearing. Would\nthat be 1983 or habeas?\nMR. LEWIS: I think that's a closer call, but I\nthink it --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's why asked you. Why\nisn't it --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LEWIS: Right. And -- and I -- I think it\nis still section 1983 if certain things are present. That\nis, is he going to necessarily imply the invalidity of the\nduration of his sentence by winning his case? And if\nthat's meets the Heck rule and if he isn't, then I think\nhe can proceed in section 1983.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have any case in which\nwhat was being -- what was sought to be challenged in a\nhabeas action was not the duration of the sentence, but\nthe procedure by which the duration of the sentence was\ndetermined?\nMR. LEWIS: I don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any -- why -- why\nshouldn't that be a habeas action? Why shouldn't 1983 be\nlimited to prison conditions, which is what we've always\n-- and referred to it as -- as that in the past?\nMR. LEWIS: Well, I think in the hypothetical\nthat you've presented, Justice Scalia, if the prisoner\nwins the case in that particular case, then his sentence\nis invalidated, and I think that's the important critical\nfactor here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, not necessarily.\nHe -- he's just saying the parole hearing I got lacked due\nprocess safeguards. Had I had those safeguards, I might\n-- I might -- have been given a shorter sentence. I can't\nprove I would have. I'm not challenging the sentence\nreally, but I want a new hearing. I didn't get due\nprocess. Give me a proper hearing because I might get out\nearlier. Why shouldn't that come under habeas?\nMR. LEWIS: Because it's not a challenge to the\nlegality of the confinement.\nJUSTICE BREYER: My law clerk found two cases\nwhich we've just looked at briefly. One is called\nWilwerding v. Swenson and the other Johnson v. Avery where\nshe says that in those two cases people were using habeas\nto challenge prison conditions even. Now, so there are --\nthere are two cases that, if she's right -- and she's\nusually right -- that -- that -- where habeas was used to\nchallenge prison conditions. So I've thought, well, if\nthey can use it, they certainly could use it here.\nMR. LEWIS: Well, and I -- I think point with --\nwith both of those decisions is that the Heck rule did not\ncome into play because the prisoners must have gone\nthrough and exhausted their State court remedies, and so\nthere wasn't an issue as to whether they must bring their\nclaim in habeas.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. It was a different issue,\nbut it said habeas could be brought.\nMR. LEWIS: Sure. I think the Court in -- in\nthat particular case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So habeas could be brought\nhere?\nMR. LEWIS: I don't think so.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not?\nMR. LEWIS: I don't think there's a remedy in\nhabeas for the respondent Johnson in this case because the\nfirst thing that's going to be asked when he goes to the\nFederal district court to seek habeas relief is, well, are\nyou challenging the legality of your custody?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and they say sure -- sure\nI am. I'm saying I had terms. You know, I was going to\nbe here under conditions A, B, C, and A, B, C in my\nopinion mean I will be released sooner, and instead, they\ngave me D, E, F, and D, E, F means I'm likely to be\nreleased later. I can't guarantee it. That's what he'll\nsay. He says I can't guarantee it, but I wouldn't be\nbringing this case if I didn't think at least it was a\nshot.\nMR. LEWIS: Right. And -- and -- but he's not\nnecessarily challenging the legality of his custody.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but that's part\nof the conclusion that we're going to have to reach to --\nto resolve the case. Why isn't he? How is that that much\ndifferent than if a judge -- let's assume, under a proper\nsentencing guideline scheme, the judge just uses the wrong\nguideline. The man is going to go to jail for either 5 or\n10 years. We don't know which. But that's -- that's a\nclassic habeas case. Here, he's going to stay in a prison\nfor 5 or 10 years. We don't know which. Why isn't this a\nclassic habeas case?\nMR. LEWIS: Because I think in -- in the first\nhypothetical, Your Honor, that -- that you gave, the\nchallenge, if successful, would -- would completely\ninvalidate the sentence that he received. They'd have to\nredo the -- the sentence.\nAnd -- and I think that's the critical\ndistinction in this case, is that when Johnson files his\ncomplaint, he has a 10- to 30-year sentence by the -- by\nthe State court. If he wins, he still has a 10- to 30-\nyear sentence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it wouldn't completely\ninvalidate the sentence. We know that he's still going to\nbe held and he's going to be held in custody. It's a\nquestion of how long, which is exactly what this case is.\nMR. LEWIS: But in the hypothetical you propose,\nJustice Kennedy, the -- the prisoner was actually -- would\nbe actually challenging the sentence he received, and by\nwinning the case, he's going to undo the State court\nsentence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, those cases happen\nto involve -- happen to involve sentences. This case\ndoesn't involve a sentence. It involves an opportunity to\nhave his sentence shortened. And if habeas can be brought\nfor that, we would phrase it differently. We wouldn't say\nit would have to invalidate the sentence. We would say it\nwould have to invalidate the proceeding that could have\nshortened his sentence. I grant you we can't use the same\nlanguage we did in the earlier cases, but if this is\nproperly a habeas action, then we -- we can get some\nlanguage to make it fit.\nMR. LEWIS: Well, I don't -- I don't think it is\nproperly a habeas action. I think even in the decisions\nwhere courts may have heard similar claims in habeas, I\nthink it was a matter of just saying, well, the prisoner\nis already here. He's already exhausted all of his State\ncourt remedies. It doesn't really matter whether it's\nsection 1983 or habeas.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose we wrote an opinion\nthat said, whatever the reasoning -- I don't know what it\nwould be right now -- that said in the future your client\nshould go ahead in 1983. I'm putting you in a slightly\nawkward position, so don't answer if you don't want to.\nBut I mean, for the future all these cases will be brought\nin habeas. Now, suppose that's what the opinion said.\nWe're absolutely making it clear just what the -- would\nthere be any harm done?\nMR. LEWIS: I -- I think there would be.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, what would that harm be?\nMR. LEWIS: I think that by -- by having a rule\nof that sort, that it would be expanding the jurisdiction\nof habeas and it would start to swallow up otherwise\ncognizable section 1983 claims.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And why would that be bad?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And why --\nMR. LEWIS: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why would that be bad?\nMR. LEWIS: Well, because the Congress has\nenacted a statute --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. But I mean, is -- I'm\nasking you a practical question as a practicing lawyer.\nWould it be bad?\nMR. LEWIS: Absolutely it would.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. LEWIS: Because there's a statute that\nallows --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, leaving aside --\nCongress changed the statute. It says absolutely it's\ngoing to be habeas. Is there any bad consequence in the\nlaw?\nMR. LEWIS: It's going to give States a license\nto violate civil rights that will otherwise not be\nprotected under the statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We'll catch them in habeas.\nMR. LEWIS: Yes, but the -- the State exhaustion\nrequirements in habeas are much tougher. Of course, the\nState wants them to have to go through State exhaustion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah, so it comes down to that.\nMR. LEWIS: That's really the critical --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You said -- you said a moment\nago that it would be expanding habeas, and I'd like you to\nexpand on that. It would be expanding habeas, I am\nassuming, because in every successful habeas case, the\nultimate remedy that the court can order, if the State\ndoes not snap to it, is the immediate release of the\nprisoner. And I take it when you said it would expand\nhabeas, it would expand it because this would not be an\nimmediate release case no matter what. Is that correct?\nMR. LEWIS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. LEWIS: You would basically end up going to\na Federal district court seeking habeas relief asking for\nprocesses to be changed prospectively.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that's why they could not\nbring habeas in this case because if they won, they still\nwould not have shown anything that entitled to them to get\nout now or get out now unless the State within 30 days\ndoes something. Is -- is that the nub of it?\nMR. LEWIS: That's -- that's really it, Justice\nSouter.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm not sure. It\ndepends how you formulate the order. The -- the judge\nsays, I'm going to order this prisoner released unless,\nwithin 6 months, he has a parole hearing under the\nguidelines I set. That's the way the habeas statute\nworks.\nMR. LEWIS: Well, if that's the relief that the\n-- the prisoner was seeking, I think that is clearly a\nhabeas claim. But that's not what Johnson is claiming in\nthis case. He's not asking for entitlement to release at\nall. He's asking for the processes to be changed\nprospectively for future parole hearings, and he's asking\nfor declaratory relief.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Regardless of what he's asking\nfor, if he got what he wanted, he still would not be\nentitled to any immediate release.\nMR. LEWIS: That's absolutely correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He would still have a sentence\nof X years, and the question is, how often are we going to\nlook at him to decide when, within X years, we may let him\nout. Is that --\nMR. LEWIS: That's -- that's absolutely it. He\ncannot -- by winning his case, he's not going to shorten\nhis sentence in any way. And that's -- that's a big\ndistinction from the Balisok case where there was an\nautomatic entitlement to a shorter sentence --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, he might --\nMR. LEWIS: -- for Balisok in that case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- he might shorten the term\nof his confinement.\nMR. LEWIS: Might but not necessarily. And this\nCourt made very clear most recently in the Nelson\ndecision --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you could say the same\nthing when you're challenging the sentence. He might but\nhe might not. We're just -- we're just hearing the case.\nMR. LEWIS: I think a challenge to the sentence\nnecessarily invalidates that sentence if you win. But a\nchallenge to parole is much different because you're not\naffecting the sentence if you win your case. And the term\nnecessary is completely necessary to the Heck analysis, as\nthis Court made clear most recently in the Nelson case\nfrom last term.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's the nub of it I guess.\nThe fact that he may be granted parole has no implication\nfor the validity of the sentence.\nMR. LEWIS: That's absolutely right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In fact, it assumes the\nsentence is valid, but that he will probably stay clean if\nhe gets out. That's all it means, isn't it?\nMR. LEWIS: That's really all it means. And\nthis Court last term in Muhammad in -- in footnote 1 made\nclear that the incarceration that matters for this\nanalysis is the -- in the incarceration of the sentence\nfrom the State court. And I think that's -- that's what\nthe Court needs to look at, is what is Johnson's effect on\nthe State court judgment or sentence. What's the\nnecessary implications? Not in this case at all.\nAnd really, this case I think has already been\ndecided by Wolff. It's something that the petitioners\nsort of don't mention too much in their briefs. In Wolff,\nthe prisoners in -- in that case were trying to get their\ngood-time credits back. I think this is an easier case\nthan the Wolff decision. And what the Court did was parse\nout, okay, you can't get your good-time credits back, but\nyou can seek prospective injunctive relief to fix the\nprocesses that are used in connection with depriving\nprisoners of good-time credits. And that's precisely what\nJohnson is seeking here.\nYour Honor, the other thing I wanted to mention\nwas the notion -- Your Honors, the other thing I want to\nmention was the notion that there's no State review of\nthese decisions. The Prison Litigation Reform Act clearly\nprovides for State administrative review of even\nchallenges to the process. So the -- the State of Ohio\ncould easily set up an appeal process administratively to\n-- to correct that problem.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Lewis.\nMR. LEWIS: Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Untereiner, is it?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN E. UNTEREINER\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT DOTSON\nMR. UNTEREINER: Yes, Justice Stevens.\nJustice Stevens, and may it please the Court:\nI'd like to, first of all, go to the point that\nJustice Ginsburg raised about the allegations in Mr.\nDotson's complaint. This case has -- has become much\nsimpler with respect to Dotson because any claim that he\nmight have had about this 2000 scheduling decision has\nbeen mooted.\nWhat's really left are claims for future\ninjunctive relief, for prospective relief. These are\nclassic 1983 type cases. Prisoners have been bringing\nlawsuits since Wolff against McDonnell alleging that\nparole procedures and other kinds of procedures,\ndisciplinary procedures ought to be reformed and seeking\nfuture injunctive relief with respect to those kinds of --\nof procedures.\nIn Edwards against Balisok, this Court indicated\nthat ordinarily claims for prospective injunctive relief\nwill not be barred by the Heck doctrine because ordinarily\nthey will not call into question or necessarily imply the\ninvalidity of any previous decision. So to Justice\nBreyer's question, this would require a change in the law,\nand it would, I think, fairly substantially cut back on\nthe kinds of suits that have been brought for 30 years\nunder Wolff because in all kinds of suits like this, the\nState would argue, as the petitioners are arguing today,\nthat there's some prior administrative decision that's\ncalled into question by a future claim for injunctive\nrelief with respect to some aspect of the procedures\nrelating to good-time credit revocation or parole or the\nrevocation of probation. So I think this would be a\nfairly substantial change in the law. A lot of these\nclaims would be barred by Heck.\nThe -- Justice Scalia, you asked a question\nabout the habeas, the scope of habeas relief. And I think\nit's important to understand that the lower courts have\ngenerally held that habeas is not available for these\nkinds of claims that are prospective only, seeking changes\nin future procedures. There are some lower court cases\nthat say that where a prisoner seeks release on parole and\ndemands a right or claims a right to release on parole,\nthat might be cognizable in habeas, but the vast weight of\nauthority in the lower courts is that claims that only\nseek an -- the right to a new parole hearing, the outcome\nof which is completely discretionary --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You want a 1983 hearing in\nwhich a United States district judge tells the parole\ncommission, now, here are your marching orders for future\ncases. You have to comply with this rule, that rule, this\nrule. What is an analog that you can give us where United\nStates courts have done this under 1983? Using an\nadministrative case, if the -- if the agency does it the\nwrong way, we reverse that decision. It would be like a\nreview of a conviction that's not final. Have we had\ncases where under 1983 litigants come in and say, now,\nthese agencies are doing it the wrong way? You have to --\ncan you give me an analog?\nMR. UNTEREINER: I think there -- there are a\nfair number of cases in the lower court where -- lower\ncourts where these types of claims for injunctive relief\nhave been brought and the Federal courts have ordered, on\na prospective basis, that the States conform to all kinds\nof -- I mean, Wolff is a case like that I think where the\n-- the State was required to do certain things in the\nfuture. So I think these are ordinary 1983 claims for\ninjunctive relief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any significant\ndifference between this case and Wolff? I mean, Wolff was\na case of procedural fault supposedly, and if those faults\nwere cured, someone would have a better chance at getting\ngood-time credit. Wasn't that what --\nMR. UNTEREINER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it seems to me it's very\n-- very close to your situation.\nMR. UNTEREINER: It is very close, Justice\nGinsburg. Dotson is essentially making two claims for\nprospective relief. He is saying that these 1998 parole\nguidelines effectively rescind his eligibility for parole.\nAt the time of his conviction, he was entitled to parole\nafter serving 15 years. Under these guidelines, he'll\nhave to wait till -- until 32 and a half years have passed\nbefore he's eligible for parole. And he's claiming that\nin -- in his next parole release hearing, which is in June\n2005 and beyond, the State is required to apply the old\nrules to him so that he'll be eligible. So this is very\nmuch like what was at issue in Wolff.\nThe second claim he has is that he's entitled to\nannual parole release hearings in the future. Again, it's\na future -- it's a prospective claim only. In the future,\nhe will be entitled to annual parole release hearings, and\nthe new rules say that the State can postpone those\nhearings for up until 10 years.\nSo on both of those claims, he is seeking\nchanges in the future, and these are classic 1983 type\ncases that have been brought, as I say, for the last 30\nyears in the lower courts.\nNow, the Heck test requires a showing that if he\nprevails on his section 1983 claims, he would -- that\nwould necessarily imply the invalidity of his underlying\nconviction or sentence. And I think this case is very\ndifferent from the Balisok case. There -- there was a\ncolloquy about that earlier. I think that Balisok is\nclearly distinguishable because the administrative\ndecision there would have had an immediate and direct\nimpact on the duration of the prisoner's sentence by -- by\nrevoking the good-time credits. Whereas, here, the impact\nis very, very speculative.\nJustice Souter, you referred earlier to a\ndurational consequence. The durational consequence here\nis really quite hypothetical and remote. If he prevails\non his 1983 claims, all he will be entitled to are future\nhearings, and since parole is entirely discretionary in\nOhio, we can't predict the outcome of those proceedings.\nHe'll also be entitled to -- merely to be considered\neligible for parole in the future. So I think that the --\nthe consequences -- any impact on -- on the duration of\nhis confinement is -- is really quite hypothetical here\nand it would require an expansion not only of the Heck\nrule but also of habeas jurisdiction to resolve this case\nin the State's favor.\nUnless there are any further questions, we would\nask that the Court affirm the Sixth Circuit's unanimous\ndecision in favor of Dotson. All 11 members of that court\nfound that Dotson's claims were not barred by Heck, and\nthis Court should affirm.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Cole, you have about 4 and a half minutes\nleft.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. COLE: Thank you, Your Honor.\nA number of points. I wanted to start by\nresponding to Justice Souter's question, which was again\nasking about this need for entitlement to early release\nas part of habeas, and would ask the Court to consider the\nIn re Braden case where a prisoner in Alabama was seeking\nto challenge a detainer that had been issued by Kentucky.\nAnd the basis for the challenge to the detainer in habeas\nwas the fact that it was having implications for his\nparole eligibility in Alabama. So there, there was not\ngoing to be necessarily an entitlement to earlier release,\nbut simply a difference in the parole considerations.\nSecond, Justice O'Connor, with respect to your\nquestions about mootness, the only point that I would add\nis that if this case is moot now, it was moot when the\nSixth Circuit decided it as well. So if mootness is the\ndirection we're going, I think there need to be a decision\nvacating the judgment below --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what's your position as\nto whether or not it's moot?\nMR. COLE: Your Honor, we don't believe it's\nmoot either, and in -- in fact, for two reasons. First,\nonce again, it's threatening consequences for an existing\ndecision, albeit it not the one that was originally\nthreatened or where invalidity would be implied below, but\nthere is a new one where that would have that consequence.\nIn terms of bad consequences, I think the single\nbiggest bad consequence of directing these prisoners to\n1983 rather than habeas is it's going to deprive them of\nthe opportunity for meaningful relief in Ohio's courts.\nThe Layne decision in the last -- decided just 2 years\nago, three prisoners brought a declaratory judgment action\nabout the way parole works in Ohio. They were successful\nand their case resulted in 3,000 prisoners receiving --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but you raise\ndeprivation of the benefit they would get from the Ohio\ncourts. If they wanted that benefit, they could have\nbrought a 1983 action in State courts. State courts have\njurisdiction. So it's a little odd for you to say, oh,\nthey're being deprived of a benefit when they're telling\nyou by this very lawsuit they don't want it.\nMR. COLE: That's true, Your Honor. At the same\ntime, this -- bringing this -- this case in 1983 in\nFederal court means that they're not going to be able to\nget injunctive relief on State grounds under the Pennhurst\ndoctrine. So they are depriving themselves of a chance to\nget that type of meaningful relief that Ohio courts are\noffering and that courts in other States are offering.\nThe other -- the other point I wanted to make is\nthat with respect to Petitioner Johnson's argument, his\nunderstanding of sentence, that if it doesn't impact the\nsentence, it can't be in habeas, would mean that parole\nrevocations can't be in habeas either. A parole -- parole\n-- when you're on parole, you're still serving part of\nyour sentence, as he understands it, part of the initial\nterm that the court has imposed upon you. Granted, you're\nnot doing it in prison, but a parole revocation wouldn't\nimpact your sentence. It would merely bring you back into\nprison to serve the remainder of your sentence rather than\nhaving you serve it on the street. So I think that\nunderstanding of sentence can't make sense for -- for\nhabeas purposes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think sentence means custody.\nDon't you think it means custody?\nMR. COLE: Well, but to the extent we're\ntalking --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The custody you've been\nsentenced to?\nMR. COLE: But to the extent we're talking about\nduration of custody or duration of confinement, again, the\nclaims here do have a -- success on the claims here would\nhave a meaningful impact on the duration of confinement.\nThis Court in Muhammad said -- I think this is probably\nthe -- the closest quote on point -- challenges to\nparticulars affecting the duration of confinement are the\nprovince of habeas corpus.\nThis is a challenge to a particular, the parole\nprocedures, that's affecting the duration of their\nconfinement. Or at least that's their allegations, and\nthat's what success on their claims is going to mean. And\nbecause of those durational consequences, as well as\nbecause of the consequences of success on the merits for\nprevious State parole decisions, we believe that those\nclaims are better routed to habeas than to 1983.\nIf there are no further questions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I had one further question.\nAre you asking us to change anything in Wolff against\nMcDonnell, or can we follow that case?\nMR. COLE: I think we can follow that case as\nit's been reinterpreted in Heck. Wolff said that -- well,\nHeck said that Wolff was about challenges that would not\n-- and I believe the language is -- necessarily vitiate\nthe underlying decision. So the way Heck understood Wolff\nwas that the procedural challenges there, with regard to\nthe prospective relief they were seeking, were not the\ntype of relief that would necessarily vitiate any decision\nthat had already been made.\nHere, by contrast, the claims that they're\nbringing, the ex post facto claims, if they're successful\non the merits, would necessarily vitiate the decisions\nthat have gone before.\nThank you, Your Honors.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Cole.\n"
