        "content": "(10:58 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We will now hear argument in\nExxon Mobil against Saudi Basic Industries.\nMr. Coleman, I trust you will soon tell us why\nthe case is not moot or whether you think it's moot, and\nif -- if not, why not.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. COLEMAN: Good morning, Justice Stevens.\nMay it please the Court:\nI will begin with that, if you would like.\nThis case is not moot because there is an\nongoing case or controversy between the parties. There is\na judgment, it is true, from the Delaware State court,\nwhich has now been affirmed by the Delaware Supreme Court.\nBut preclusion doctrines not Rooker-Feldman and not\nmootness govern the resolution of the claims that we\nasserted first -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what financial\ninterests do your clients have to keep litigating today in\nanother court?\nMR. COLEMAN: I don't know the -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What's going on? I mean,\nit's very confusing.\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, certainly, Justice O'Connor,\nwe've not yet recovered on our judgment and that judgment\nis still there. It is still in existence. We've not yet\ncollected on it.\nBut I don't believe that mootness turns on\nwhether you have, in fact, collected on a judgment. There\nare very few cases out there in which a party has, in\nfact, obtained two judgments, one from a State court and\none from a Federal court, usually because a party waived\nthe application of preclusion doctrines. And -- and we\nhave conceded previously that that's not our interest.\nWhat is our interest here is that we have\nasserted Federal jurisdiction. This case was brought in\nFederal court by SABIC. During the course of discovery,\nwe found some things out that they had been overcharging\nus and we indicated that we were going to bring claims\nagainst them in Federal court. They ran down to Delaware\ncourt by forum shopping in order to try to obtain a\nshorter statute of limitations, which turned out for them\nto be a strategic blunder of monumental proportions.\nBut the Federal case, when we filed it, those\nclaims had original jurisdiction in Federal court. They\nhave not yet been resolved in a proper way. We -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But do you have a continuing\ncase or controversy? That was -- that -- that's a bedrock\nArticle III requirement, and if you've got all the relief\nthat you were seeking -- let's put it this way. Suppose\nyour opponent SABIC says, here's the check for the $417\nmillion and we undertake that we're not going to pursue\nany further relief. Would you have a case or controversy\nleft?\nMR. COLEMAN: Yes, Your Honor. We might not\nhave an interest in pursuing the case, but we have a legal\ninterest in terms of Article III case or controversy. It\nis well established that the -- the fact of taking a\njudgment does not make a case moot. In fact, if there\nwere a holding that we think that the Federal case were\nmoot -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you've got all the\nrelief to which you are entitled, that does make a case\nmoot.\nMR. COLEMAN: In terms of cases that involve\ninjunctive relief where it is impossible for a court to\ngive you the relief that you have -- that you are seeking,\nthat is true. But when you are seeking money damage, it\nis at least theoretically possible -- we're not saying\nthat we're going to ask for that, but at least\ntheoretically possible that the Federal district court\ncould still give us relief. And therefore, what we are\nasking for is -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What relief could it give you?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But what for?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What relief? If you're paid\nin full, what -- what relief are you entitled to?\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, we think the relief that\nwe're entitled to, in terms of this, is for the case to be\nremanded for the district court to resolve these issues\nunder preclusion doctrines.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But what issues would -- would\nthe district court resolve?\nMR. COLEMAN: Preclusion.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if you win on the\npreclusion --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who cares?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- what do you get then in\nsubstance?\nMR. COLEMAN: We don't necessarily intend to\ntake a -- another judgment in Federal court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then what do you intend to do?\nIf you win on preclusion, what do you do then?\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, hopefully we'll win on\npreclusion with respect not only to this suit, the New\nJersey II suit, but also the New Jersey I suit, which we\nsay the district -- or the Delaware judgment precludes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think we'd like an\nanswer. Justice Ginsburg gives us -- gives you a\nhypothetical case. You've got the money. The judgment\nhas been discharged in the State courts. What is left to\ndo in the Federal court?\nMR. COLEMAN: It is likely -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, the one answer I heard\nyou give, well, we're interested in preclusion to say -\nwell, that's all historical at that point. Who cares?\nMR. COLEMAN: It -- it is likely, Your Honor -\nand we have previously said -- that we may very well\ndismiss the case of our own accord. But that doesn't\nmean -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We're looking for -- we're\nlooking for something that makes the case live.\nMR. COLEMAN: Our claims are alive. There are\nclaims there that seek relief -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we're -- we're questioning\nwhy that is and we're asking you what relief you need to\nget that you wouldn't get in the hypothetical that Justice\nGinsburg posed.\nMR. COLEMAN: We thought we would not seek\nfurther monetary relief.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know how many claims in\nthis case that -- that were not in the Delaware case?\nMR. COLEMAN: We have affirmative defenses to\nthe New Jersey I, but -- but the claims in New Jersey II\nand Delaware are the same, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is your answer that you might\nwant equitable relief, an injunction to continue making\npayments in the future, or something like that?\nMR. COLEMAN: No, Your Honor. We're not seeking\nadditional monetary or equitable relief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you would be stuck\nanyway because you made a counterclaim and -- and it would\nbe -- on which you prevailed. And in that counterclaim\nyou would be precluded if you didn't ask for everything\nthat you could get.\nBut -- but at this stage at least, the -- the\ndoor -- there -- there is still conceivably an avenue of\nfurther litigation because, SABIC hasn't yet said that\nit's not going to do anything more, that it isn't going to\npetition for cert, for example.\nMR. COLEMAN: And, indeed, Your Honor. I mean,\nSABIC has represented to the Court that it likely intends\nto seek certiorari relief from this Court in the Delaware\nsuit.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it has -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if they do, it's not\nfinished.\nMR. COLEMAN: It is not finished -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, all right. I'll ask them\nthat.\nMR. COLEMAN: Getting back to the Rooker-Feldman\nissue, which is the issue on which the Court granted cert,\nRooker-Feldman is a narrow, limited doctrine, but it bars\nonly appellate review not parallel litigation in Federal\ndistrict courts. Rooker-Feldman is not a theory of\nvanishing original jurisdiction, nor is it a\njurisdictional substitute for the preclusion analysis\nmandated by Congress in the Full Faith and Credit Act.\nThe expansive interpretation asserted by SABIC\nmisperceives the fundamental nature of appellate review.\nIt's untethered to any natural negative implication in 28\nU.S.C. 1257. It illegitimately displaces the application\nof section 1738, the Full Faith and Credit Act, in most\ncases to which it is traditionally applied, and it serves\nabsolutely no useful purpose.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the problem that bothers\nme -- and I don't know that there's an answer to it -- is\nyou have plaintiff. Plaintiff goes into State court. He\nbrings a lawsuit, a tort suit, a contract suit. And then\nhe decides he'd also like to go to Federal court. He\nbrings exactly the same suit. And here we have two suits\nand exactly the same thing running along at the same time.\nNow, I know there are principles from this Court's case\nlaw that says, well, that's what's supposed to happen.\nThey've always bothered me.\nBut now let's take a special instance. The\nspecial instance is that in court one in the State, the\nplaintiff loses. Now, what he decides to do is to say to\nthe Federal court, we want you to review what they did in\nthe State court. Can't do that. Right?\nMR. COLEMAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So he brilliantly\nfigures out I will omit the word review from my -- from my\nmotion. I will ask for precisely the same thing just not\nuse that word review. I will ask them to go and make\ntheir decision which happens to be -- in my opinion should\nbe -- 100 percent the opposite of what the State court did\nshowing they're wrong. But I won't use the word review.\nNow, you say because he cut the word review out, he can do\nit.\nMR. COLEMAN: No, Justice Breyer. It's not\nbecause he cut the review out. Rooker-Feldman is an issue\nof appellate -- the exercise of appellate jurisdiction.\nSo what does appellate jurisdiction mean? Well,\nappellate -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Coleman, would you\nclarify, I think, in response to Justice Breyer's inquiry?\nRooker-Feldman both involved State court litigation that\nwas over and done with. Then you come to the Federal\ncourt. You have two parallel cases would be -- brought\nwithin a month of each other?\nMR. COLEMAN: Within 2 months of each other.\nWithin a month of each other, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And isn't the standard\ndefense of the person who has started the other suit\nfirst, well, Your Honor, prior action pending, please hold\nthe case that started second in abeyance till we get done?\nAnd if we win in the first case, then it will be\nprecluded. Then the second case -- the parallel case will\nbe precluded. That's not Rooker-Feldman territory.\nMR. COLEMAN: That's -- that's -- Your Honor,\nthat's our position that -- concurrent jurisdiction is a\nseparate issue from the appellate review issue that\nRooker-Feldman raises.\nJustice Breyer, the answer to your hypothetical\nis that appellate review is something different from\nhaving a parallel action. Appellate review is probably\nbest defined by two characteristics that I'll try to flesh\nout for you.\nThe first is that the proponent alleges some\nsort of injury-causing error by the trial court and not by\nthe adversary and then seeks an order reversing, vacating,\nor otherwise nullifying that lower court order. When a\nparty alleges an injury by his adversary rather than the\ntrial court, the most that can really be said is that you\nare continuing on a parallel litigation but not that you\nare seeking appellate review. You do not have what looks\nlike appellate review. You're not alleging errors by the\nlower court. You're not seeking an order that directly\nnullifies or otherwise undoes the State court judgment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the argument -- it\nseems to me the argument is that in a de facto sense, when\nyou try to litigate the Federal case, after losing the\nState case, you in effect are asking the Federal court in\nsome sense to review what happened in the State court.\nJustice Ginsburg's answer to that is preclusion is the\nanswer. Is that your answer?\nMR. COLEMAN: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Because if that -- if that is\n-- if we accept that as the answer, then there's no\nargument for saying you should expand Rooker-Feldman to\ninclude the de facto review as opposed to the -- the very\nstrict sense of review that you're talking about.\nMR. COLEMAN: That is absolutely our position,\nJustice Souter, that preclusion addresses all of these\nissues.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, but can you -- can you\nexpand on this a little? I'm not taking a view on it.\nI'm trying to clear up what's a confusion in my mind. I\nsee how you could do this on the parallel business with -\nwith delaying it on the docket and using the doctrine of\npreclusion. I understand that.\nBut we've still got this doctrine called Rooker\nFeldman out there, and as long as you have that doctrine,\nit strikes me as odd if -- say, it weren't a plaintiff.\nSay it was the losing party, you know, that was asking the\nFederal judge, Judge, you have this case on your docket.\nLet's move it up. Let's decide it now. He doesn't use\nthe word review, but everything else is the same. He\nwants a decision out of that court that is going to be the\nopposite of what the State court did. And what's\nconcerning me -- maybe I shouldn't be concerned, but\nwhat's concerning me is whether he can get it or not seems\nto turn completely on whether he uses the word review in\nthe petition.\nMR. COLEMAN: I don't -- I don't think that that\nis true. It should not and does not turn on the words\nthat you use in your petition. What it turns on is the\nfundamental nature of the injury that you claim and of the\nrelief that you seek.\nOne reason why you don't need to be necessarily\nconcerned about this is that in all of these cases in\nwhich one case has gone to judgment and there is a -\neither a continuation or a new case, preclusion is going\nto cover these.\nThe only extension of Rooker-Feldman that SABIC\nis asking for is what they call the actually litigated\ntest. That is the heart of the Full Faith and Credit Act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Rooker-Feldman, if I\nunderstand it correctly, is a subject matter jurisdiction\nbar. Is that --\nMR. COLEMAN: Yes, Your Honor. It -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. And -\nMR. COLEMAN: -- it arises from a negative\nimplication taken from section 1257 and a second negative\nimplication from 1331.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, to -- so if the two\nlawsuits, the State court suit and the Federal suit -\nthey're proceeding concurrently or one is held in abeyance\nwaiting the other, there is certainly subject matter\njurisdiction in the Federal court of the Federal action.\nMR. COLEMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: To apply Rooker-Feldman in\nthat context would say you had subject matter jurisdiction\nat the outset, but then you lost it somewhere down the\nline.\nMR. COLEMAN: And -- and -- yes, Justice\nGinsburg. And that's a distinction between your\nhypothetical and Justice Breyer's. Justice Breyer's, as I\n-- if I understand it correctly, is that the Federal suit\nstarts after the State court is done. Yours is where you\nhave parallel actions at the same time. And where the\nFederal claims are parallel or even filed first, as in our\ncase, you can't say that the moment you file those that\nyou're seeking review of some nonexistent State court\njudgment. You're simply asking for relief from something\nthat your adversary did to you.\nAnd the argument that SABIC makes that the court\nrelinquishes jurisdiction has no basis or justification in\nanything this Court has ever said. It is a theory of\nvanishing jurisdiction that I cannot understand.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Coleman, can I interrupt\nwith a question?\nMR. COLEMAN: Of course.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is it your position that what\nshould have been done in this case, not in the\nhypothetical case, is the trial court should have just\nstayed the action pending the outcome of the Delaware\ncase?\nMR. COLEMAN: And, in fact, that's what the\nFederal district court had done, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And that's what -- he did -\nthat was correct.\nMR. COLEMAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And then when the Delaware\ncase was over, then what should he have done?\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, we could either ultimately\ndismiss it or the Federal district court could say, looks\nlike your Delaware case is over. SABIC brings a motion -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And -- and he has given you\nall the relief your entitled to. Therefore, you go ahead\nand dismiss the case.\nMR. COLEMAN: Yes, or SABIC brings a motion -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And therefore, my next\nquestion is why shouldn't we do exactly that now.\nMR. COLEMAN: Because the question before the\nCourt today is a question of jurisdiction, not of\npractical consequences other than the mootness question\nthat SABIC has raised. But practical consequences are\nthat what we may -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, maybe we could vacate\nthe judgment of the court of appeals, say that was wrong,\nbut still, order it dismissed after we vacate the\njudgment.\nMR. COLEMAN: I think, as in Feldman, that's a\nquestion that should be first addressed by the district\ncourt. Certainly we hope that you will vacate or reverse\nthe Third Circuit's judgment and allow the district court\nto address those issues. Perhaps we dismiss it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if you don't tell us what\nissue remains, I don't know why we shouldn't just direct\nthe suit to be dismissed.\nMR. COLEMAN: There -- there is a live -- in -\nin the terms of Article III, there are live claims that\nremain pending before the district court. And while it is\ntrue -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And I take it that's because\nyou don't have the cert period expired yet in the first\naction and you don't have the check.\nMR. COLEMAN: At the very minimum -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. It's -- if the 3 months\nis expired and the check is in your hand and it's\ncertified, what's left?\nMR. COLEMAN: As a practical matter, we have no\nintention. As a jurisdictional matter, there's still -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not asking about your\nintention. Let's assume you do intend to litigate\nfurther. What for?\nMR. COLEMAN: If we did intend to litigate\nfurther, SABIC would be entitled to go to the district\ncourt and say they can't. They are precluded.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I want -- I want an answer to\nmy question. What are you going to litigate for? What's\nleft?\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, again, setting aside our\nintentions and hypothetically, there are cases in which -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm talking about your case.\nWhat's left?\nMR. COLEMAN: We -- we do not seek -- will not\nseek any further review from the district court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Nothing is left.\nMR. COLEMAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, suppose you don't have the\ncheck. What's left?\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, the case is still up in the\nair.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why?\nMR. COLEMAN: Because -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You have a judgment.\nMR. COLEMAN: -- the case -- the case is not\nover. Indeed, because the State -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I never heard of a case that\nisn't over until you get the check. I thought the case is\nover when you have the judgment.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then if they don't give you\nthe check, you have a different matter. We have to get it\nenforced.\nMR. COLEMAN: There is a different matter.\nBut as a matter of Article III jurisdiction,\nYour Honor, the -- the mootness doctrine does not apply to\na situation where you have a judgment and it doesn't\nnecessarily apply the moment you get paid.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that you lost in the\nState court and the judgment is final. You then go to\nFederal court. Are -- is there a context in which Rooker\nFeldman might then be applicable? This is all\nhypothetical.\nMR. COLEMAN: Our argument is that it would be\napplicable only if the injury that we claimed in our\nFederal suit was an injury caused by the State court -\nthe court itself or the judge rather than our adversary\nand we sought relief from that judgment. That would\nobtain the nature of appellate jurisdiction rather than we\nsay, well, SABIC did us wrong, we'd like a judgment. And\nthen SABIC can come in and say, well, they're precluded.\nThey already tried that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, if you had\nsome ongoing relation and, in this hypothetical, the State\ncourt ruled against you and you went in to try to reverse\nthat ruling, that would be -- that would Rooker-Feldman.\nMR. COLEMAN: Yes. If we alleged harm from the\ncourt and sought relief from the court's judgment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There were only the two\ncases, Rooker and Feldman, that established this.\nMR. COLEMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Has this Court ever said\nanything to suggest that Rooker-Feldman, as apart from\npreclusion doctrine, applies to parallel litigation\ninstead of you go into Federal court after the State court\nis over and you're trying to undo what the State court\ndid?\nMR. COLEMAN: I don't think this Court has ever\nheld any such thing, and I think it would be inconsistent\nwith at least Feldman itself. The idea of -- of appellate\njurisdiction over the constitutional claims in Feldman\nthat were held not to be barred comes down in the end -\nSABIC says, well, those claims weren't actually litigated.\nBut the opinion itself on page 467 points out that the Mr.\nFeldman had raised his constitutional claims in front of\nthe D.C. Court of Appeals in terms of asking for his\nwaiver. And when I checked the oral argument transcript\nfrom the Feldman case, it was mentioned specifically in\nterms of Mr. Feldman had raised the constitutional claims\nin front of the D.C. Court. And that's on pages 9, 14,\nand 16 of the LEXIS version of the oral argument\ntranscript.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's no preclusion\nunless they're also decided.\nMR. COLEMAN: Yes. Well, yes. The district\ncourt could then decide whether in fact they were\nprecluded, and -- and it's likely that they were. I\ndidn't follow up on what happened when the case went back\ndown on remand.\nBut the Court said, we're not going to decide\nthat. We will allow the district court to address that in\nthe first instance.\nAnd so we think that the actually litigated\nrevision of Rooker-Feldman is simply inconsistent with\nFeldman itself, that it improperly displaces full faith\nand credit that is not true to the negative implication\nfrom section 1257 which has to be a very narrow\nimplication, indeed, because 1257 gives this Court\njurisdiction, and it's only appellate jurisdiction, to\nsuggest that another court doesn't have that appellate\njurisdiction must be -- must be narrowly limited to the\ncontext, the type of lawsuits that this Court would seek,\nwhich is not simply they did me wrong, please -- please\ngive me money, but rather, that lower court erred. It\nviolated my rights. It is structurally or in some -- in\nviolation of Federal rights or something that the court\ndid and that you have been asked to fix. That, we think,\nis consistent with the proper negative implication from\n1257, but overrunning most of preclusion law simply is\nnot.\nFor these reasons, we would ask the Court to\nreverse.\nAnd, Justice Stevens, I would like to reserve\nthe remainder of my time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You may do so.\nMr. Castanias. I hope you'll tell us also\nwhether you think the case is moot before you're through.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. CASTANIAS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. CASTANIAS: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case is moot. There is nothing for Exxon\nMobil to get at this -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you're still asking for\ncert.\nMR. CASTANIAS: That's right, and that's -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then why is it moot?\nBecause something could happen. We might get this case in\ntheory, take it on cert, and discover a jurisdictional\nproblem that somehow destroys the case without a decision,\nand should that happen, there luckily for them they have\nthis other case going. So as long as -- you're prepared,\nI take it, to say you're going to ask for cert. If that's\nwhat you're going to say, I don't see how the case is\nover. It's up to you.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Okay. Well, I'm -- I'm not\ngoing to take the Hobson's choice, Your Honor, but I am\ngoing to tell you, first of all, that SABIC is going to\napply for cert. At least that's my current understanding.\nAnd second of all, that shows why this case is\nnot justiciable at this point because if the most likely\nevent in the -- in the event of this Court's review of the\nDelaware determination, is a reversal on a statute of\nlimitations problem. That's the reason this suit was\nbrought as the, quote, insurance policy that the Third\nCircuit identified, which was if the Delaware Supreme\nCourt or the Delaware Superior Court had kicked this suit\non the ground of the 3-year statute of limitations -- and\nif you look at page 20a of the supplemental brief, the\ncorrected supplemental brief that we filed with the Court,\nincluding the Delaware Supreme Court's opinion, you'll see\nthat they had a whale of a time getting over the plain\nlanguage of their own statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If for -- somehow\nyou won on that, even though it sounds a little like a\nState law issue, but nonetheless, if you won on that and\nthey reversed it as a statute of limitations, then what\nthey're saying is, well, that's just why we filed in\nFederal court. We didn't want the Federal court to review\nthe State court. We wanted our Federal court suit as an\ninsurance policy in case something goes wrong with the\nState court suit. It has nothing whatsoever to do with\nRooker-Feldman. It is parallel adjudication, just what he\nsaid. Now, what's your response?\nMR. CASTANIAS: My response, Justice Breyer, is\ntwofold. First of all, with regard to the mootness\nquestion, if that eventuality occurs, that's the time when\nthere may be a justiciable issue for a Federal district\ncourt. Not now. We've been talking about ifs and\nhypotheticals and what may happen in the future.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Castanias, was there a\nproper case in the district court when the complaint was\ninitially filed there some 2 months after you filed in\nDelaware?\nMR. CASTANIAS: We've never disputed that,\nJustice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: All right. So you can bring\ntwo cases, identical cases, in two different courts, and\nthat's an everyday thing, and the defense is prior action\npending.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, you are urging that\nRooker-Feldman which this Court never applied when you had\nparallel litigation be extended into a domain which is\nordinarily taken care of by preclusion doctrine. Why\nwould you want to mix those two things up that now seem to\nme rather clear, that if you have Rooker-Feldman, when you\nrush into a Federal court and say, Federal court, undo\nthat State court judgment, I don't like it? Rooker was\njust a paradigm case of that. Why would you want to\nspread that doctrine? What is -- what is there that\npreclusion doctrine doesn't accomplish?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, Justice Ginsburg,\npreclusion doctrine may accomplish this in a certain\nnumber of cases, but I think it's important -- and I think\nI have to correct my colleague on the other side here with\nregard to the state of the record. Yes, there was a stay\nof the New Jersey II trial court litigation, but it wasn't\nbecause of the Colorado River application that we made.\nIn fact, if you'll look in the appendix to the petition -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I'm not talking about\nanything fancy like Colorado River. Prior action pending\nis a familiar defense. You've got two actions. They\ncould even be in different districts of the same State and\none says, Your Honor, this case started second, the other\none is going forward, hold it abeyance because there's a\nprior action pending. That's not Colorado River\nabstention or anything like that.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, I -- I think, Your Honor,\nyou will see that that is a component of Colorado River,\nand that was part of the application that we made to the\ndistrict court in this case under Colorado River. And my\nonly answer -- the only reason that I'm bringing this up,\nJustice Ginsburg, is that if you'll look in the appendix\nto the petition for certiorari, you will see that SABIC,\nmy client, made an application for Colorado River\nabstention, and the district court denied that. The\ndistrict court denied that in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, sometimes district\njudges rule incorrectly, but -- but what happened here is\nthe district court case did not go on because the two of\nyou, both sides, said, okay, the district court -- they're\nall bollixed up with this Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act,\nso we're going to agree. You agreed that the case would\ngo forward in Delaware, the trial in Delaware. Is that\nnot so?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, it was -- it was -- if\nyou'll look at -- I believe this is at page 8a of the\naddendum to the red brief. You'll see that it was Exxon\nMobil that pushed in Delaware, but that actually happened\nbefore the ruling on sovereign immunity, that -- that they\nelected to go forward in Delaware.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, when you say they\npushed in Delaware, you brought them into Delaware and a\n-- in a reverse suit. You wanted a declaration of non\nliability.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They brought their case for\nliability in the Federal forum. They were forced by you\ninto the Delaware forum, and now you're saying you were\npushed, that Exxon pushed. You brought the case in\nDelaware. They didn't.\nMR. CASTANIAS: We -- that is true that we\nbrought the initial case, but the case was eventually\ntried on their counterclaims. The case was inverted to\nmake them the party plaintiff. They went first at trial\nand is it -- at the page I cited to you, that was where\nthey decided to go forward with the Delaware case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was your preferred\nforum, not theirs. When they filed their complaint, they\nfiled it in New Jersey where they had a related case\npending. So you chose the forum.\nMR. CASTANIAS: That -- that is absolutely the\ncase with regard to the Delaware matter.\nBut I think what your question is getting at -\nand I think I have to go back a couple of minutes in our\ncolloquy here to talk about why abstention won't do the\nwork in this case. In the lion's share of cases, it\nprobably will, Your Honor, but in this case it didn't.\nAnd this brings me back to Justice Breyer's\nquestion which said -- in which he said that -- that\nconcurrent jurisdiction has always bothered him because\nwhat you're ending up with is a race to judgment. But\nit's important again, Justice Breyer. It's a race to\njudgment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's -- you see,\nJustice Ginsburg answered that. I -- I mean, she wasn't\nanswering my question, but she did say what was a\nperfectly satisfactory approach, that -- that the second\nperson says, you know, Judge, there's another one pending\nand the judge says, okay, we'll let that go first except\nin some unusual instance.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Which happens thousands of\ntimes in -- in all of the courts. It's very common and I\ndon't know why we're over-designing this vehicle. It's\nsimply other action pending. End of case.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Justice Kennedy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or end of argument, not end of\ncase.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: So why isn't it that the end?\nI mean, here it's not moot. They filed the other action.\nYou point out that you not only think something could\nwreck the State claim, you would love it to wreck the\nState claim. And -- and therefore, they have this\ninsurance policy in Federal court which they'll gear up if\nand when the State claim does get wrecked as you hope.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Justice Breyer, I think this is\nthe point in the argument where I want to turn to the\ndefinition of review as this Court has -- has put it forth\nin cases like ASARCO. This is a case that Exxon Mobil\ndismisses in their reply brief as mere dictum. I don't\nthink that this -- the discussion of Rooker-Feldman and\nthe ASARCO case can be dismissed as dictum in that it was\na specific response to a specific proposal by the United\nStates appearing as amicus to dismiss the case for lack of\nstanding and instead remit plaintiffs to pursuing a second\nsuit.\nIn that case, the Court wrote that to re\nadjudicate -- and I'm quoting here from the opinion, and I\ndon't have the particular page here -- to re-adjudicate\nthe very same issues that were determined in the State\ncourt proceedings would be -- again quoting -- in essence,\nan attempt to obtain direct review of the Arizona Supreme\nCourt's decision in the lower Federal courts.\nIn ASARCO, there was no reference to what the\nintent of the plaintiffs was. There was no reference to\nwhat the timing of the lawsuits was. It was simply that\nidentical issues actually litigated.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So perhaps the Court, if it\nhad been more cautious, would have spoken not in terms of\nRooker-Feldman or review, but in terms of this matter has\nbeen decided. It is claim-precluded. That's what\npreclusion doctrine is supposed to do. So in that\ncontext, maybe this Court used the wrong word. Maybe it\nshould have said, you litigated it, it's over and done\nwith, now it's precluded. Why do you need to interject\nthe word review?\nIsn't that -- unless you're going to say every\ntime court A decides a case and then you're in court B and\nsomeone is raising the same claim, that is a review of\ncourt number one rather than you're precluded in court two\nbecause of what is -- has been litigated and decided in\ncourt one.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, first of all, Justice\nGinsburg, I'm hesitant to say that this Court was\nincautious in its use of words. This was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It is sometimes.\nMR. CASTANIAS: But -- understandably, but -\nbut with regard to -- with regard to Rooker-Feldman, it\nwas not just -- it was not just an accidental -\nincidental invocation of it. It was the reason for the\nrejection of the argument. The reason was not res\njudicata. The reason was respect for the dignity of the\nState court's work in the case, and that's ultimately -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's why one has preclusion\nbecause you are giving respect, full faith and credit, to\na decision elsewhere. That's what preclusion doctrine is\nall about. We respect the judgment of the court that\nrendered it. We, therefore, give it full faith and\ncredit. That's what preclusion doctrine is about, is\nabout respect and credit. Isn't that so?\nMR. CASTANIAS: That's -- that's -- that is -\nthat is generally right, Justice Ginsburg, but at the same\ntime, there -- we all agree -- Exxon Mobil, SABIC, and the\ndecisions of this Court -- that there has to be some\noverlap with regard to Rooker-Feldman and SABIC -- and -\nexcuse me -- and -- and preclusion doctrine. The -- the\nargument made by Exxon Mobil, which is, in essence, the\nsame question you're asking me, would have destroyed any\nreason whatsoever for the Rooker and the Feldman cases, as\nwell as the ASARCO case. There's also a significant body\nof law that's body of law that's been built up over the\nlast 85 years in the lower courts in -- in this regard.\nAnd -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So some of the lower courts\nhave given a broad interpretation to Rooker-Feldman and\nhave turned it into something other than the narrower view\nof it. And I think that's why we granted cert in this\ncase, to decide whether to give it a broad or a narrow\ninterpretation. The Third Circuit applies a rather broad\ninterpretation of it.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, I -- I guess in that\nrespect, Justice O'Connor, I disagree because the Third\nCircuit, admitted by its own words, applies a very narrow\nversion of Rooker-Feldman. And, in fact, using this case\nas the vehicle to decide this, the -- the definition of\nRooker-Feldman in this instance amounts to no more than\nbarring jurisdiction in a second Federal suit over the\nidentical claims. This is not a case where you have to\nworry about claims that might have been brought, the sort\nof things that footnote 16 in Feldman dealt with.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But maybe that isn't a proper\napplication of Rooker-Feldman where the complaint is not\nabout something the State court has improperly done.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It isn't. And so in that\nsense, the Third Circuit has a rather broader view of it\nI'd say.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, to be sure, Justice\nO'Connor, the Third Circuit's view is broader than that\nwhich appears to be adopted by the Ninth Circuit, as well\nas the Seventh Circuit.\nAnd I think this brings me back to the\ndefinition of review. The -- the Ninth and Seventh\nCircuits' views in our estimation are wrong because they\nstrictly look to the subjective intent of the plaintiff\nand as to whether the plaintiff is, in fact, seeking\nreversal. That -- that's the term that's used in these\ncases. Noel says seeking to set aside.\nBut section 1257 -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, that's the language\nthat was used in both Rooker and Feldman too I think.\nMR. CASTANIAS: And that's because, Justice\nStevens, that's -- that was the particular fact pattern of\nthis -- of that case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And that's the only fact\npattern any of our cases have dealt with.\nMR. CASTANIAS: That's -- in the Supreme Court,\nthat's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the -- and the concern is I\nthink -- at least as I understand the -- the concern with\nit, it -- it boils down to something like this. Somebody\ncomes along and says, don't apply claim preclusion. Don't\napply it because, for whatever reason, there's this -\nthere's something wrong here, and -- and Federal court\nshould determine the -- in fact, the -- the claim\npreclusion of the State judgment should not apply. The\nanswer to that is, look, that's an issue to be raised by\nway of appeal of your State judgment. You don't appeal\nState judgments in Federal court. Out.\nThere's no such claim being made here. The only\nclaim that's being made here or the only conceivable\nclaim, I guess, that can be made here is that we might\nwant to do some litigating in the Federal case after the\nState case is over. There's no claim here that claim\npreclusion should not apply in that instance, and because\nthere's no such argument that claim preclusion does not\napply, the answer to the problem that you're worried about\nis simply claim preclusion doctrine. There's no reason to\nadd a perihelion or something onto Rooker-Feldman to deal\nwith what is really a very simple problem and that is, if\nthey try to relitigate anew in Federal court, as Justice\nGinsburg says, you -- you plead claim preclusion. Simple.\nWhy do we need to complicate it beyond that simplicity?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, Justice Souter, I -- I\ndon't have any qualms with the application of claim\npreclusion here. The -- the Third Circuit, though, was\nbeing -- was being sensitive to the interests of the State\ncourts, as well as sensitive to the fact that it had\nanother jurisdictional issue in front of it, which was\nsubject matter jurisdiction under the FSIA. And I'm -\nI'm certain, as certain can be, that that court would have\nreached the same result if res judicata had been before\nit.\nBut the -- the fact is that Rooker-Feldman is\nthere and, again, as -- as with my response to Justice\nGinsburg earlier, your -- your question would effectively\nrub out any need for even Rooker and Feldman themselves.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, no, because the -- it -\nit would not rule out the need to have some answer when\nsomeone in a Federal court comes along and says, don't\napply claim preclusion, whatever the reason may be. Don't\napply the claim preclusion rules. There's something\nunfair about doing it here. The answer to that is, look,\nwhat you're really asking us to do, when you say don't\napply claim preclusion, is to review what happened in the\nState court, and we don't sit as an appellate court on\nState courts. So there's still something for Rooker\nFeldman to do on, as it were, Justice -- Justice\nGinsburg's claim preclusion argument.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, Justice Souter, I think\nagain, with respect to the hypothetical that you've put to\nme, the claim preclusion is appropriately -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It'll get the -- it'll get the\njob done that you say will need to be done if you get to\nthat point.\nMR. CASTANIAS: It -- it should get the job\ndone.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why won't it?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, there -- there are -\nfirst of all, there are no guarantees. The -- the\npreclusion doctrines are -- are riddled with exceptions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- then you -\nMR. CASTANIAS: The preclusion doctrine -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- then you appeal. Don't\nask for a new body of law. Just say, look, you got the\napplication of claim preclusion wrong in this case. We're\ngoing to appeal.\nMR. CASTANIAS: I -- I disagree, Justice Souter,\nthat -- that we're asking for anything like a huge, new\nbody of law or that the Third Circuit was making a huge,\nnew body of law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you're asking us to\nextend Rooker-Feldman beyond where this Court has taken\nit, and if I recall correctly, you really didn't ask for\nthis. The Third Circuit injected Rooker-Feldman into the\ncase. Is that not true?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, that's true, Justice\nGinsburg, but it's true because of the briefing cycle.\nWhen we briefed the case, there was no Delaware judgment.\nAnd it was only on the eve of oral argument -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Castanias -\nMR. CASTANIAS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- could -- could I come back\nto mootness? One -- one could say that not only is claim\npreclusion the answer to Rooker-Feldman, it's also the\nanswer to the asserted mootness here. I mean, you -- you\ndon't have to move to dismiss it as moot. All you have to\ndo is move to dismiss because of a prior adjudication that\nhas resolved this question.\nDo you know of any case in which the existence\nof a prior judgment in another court has been held to\nrender a suit that someone wants to press to get a second\njudgment moot? I mean, you'd think there would be a case\non that, and I suppose the reason there isn't is that\nbecause the other side is always going to plead res\njudicata.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, or the other side is going\nto give up.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or give up.\nBut is there any case in which mootness is\nestablished by the fact that there is a prior judgment of\nanother court giving you what you are asking for from this\nCourt?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, Justice Scalia, in the -\nin the realm that we're talking about here, the Fourth\nCircuit's decision in the Friedman's case came to a\nmootness conclusion. We've also cited in our brief -- and\nI don't recall the names of them off the top of my head -\ntwo cases in which the Court either -- either dismissed or\nremanded for consideration of mootness in light of another\nState court judgment. So I think there is -- there is a\nbody of law, but I also know that it is -- as recently as\nyesterday looking at Wright and Miller on this issue, that\nwhen complete relief has been accorded by another\ntribunal, that is the classic case of mootness.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I don't know why -\nwell, if it's -- if it were so classic, there would be a\nlot of cases, and I don't -- I'm not sure that any of\nyours are right on point. And -- and I think the reason\nis that you don't need it, that claim preclusion is -- is\nthe remedy for the party who wants to get out of it.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, and again, I'm -- I'm\ncertainly not going to fight claim preclusion because this\nis a suit that should not be here. This is -- this has\nhad moving parts since we -- since the petition was\ngranted with the Delaware Supreme Court ruling and now\nwith yesterday's denial of reargument in the Delaware\nSupreme Court. What -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why is it moot? Or even on -\nwhy does claim preclusion apply? I mean, if you win, from\nwhat you've said -- somehow convince us that this refusal\nto apply the State statute of limitations properly\nviolated some Federal law, let's say -- then that would\nshow that the State statute of limitations applied and\nbarred their claim. Would that be sufficient to knock out\nthe Federal suit too?\nMR. CASTANIAS: I'm not sure I understand the\nquestion, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, is -- does the State\nstatute of limitations, if -- if it applied to the State's\ncase, does it also apply in the Federal cases, the\nidentical ground that everybody agrees that the State\nstatute governs?\nMR. CASTANIAS: The -- the -- there could be -\nthere could be issue-preclusive grounds on such a ruling,\nJustice Breyer, but -- but -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, if you -- if you win,\nthen -- then -- if you win your State case, because of the\nargument you made, do you also automatically win the\nFederal case? Is it the same issue?\nMR. CASTANIAS: I -- I don't think I could say\nthat at this point because -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So it may not be the same\nissue. Then -- then they say, okay, it's not going to be\nclaim preclusion, and you'd have to say insofar as it's\nnot the same issue, it's not claim preclusion. And\ntherefore, they could proceed with their Federal case,\nwhich is what they want to do I guess.\nMR. CASTANIAS: And -- and that is a future\nevent.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. So we can't say it's moot\nin any -- and we can't say there's an alternative basis\nwhere they'd win, can we?\nI mean, I'm saying -- I'm thinking if we get\ninto conference, we're discussing this case, and I say,\nwell, I have to think this through, is it the case that if\nyou're right and you end up winning in this Court, that\ntheir case in Federal court is over? I think no, it may\nnot be. The answer is it may not be. Then this is not\nmoot at all. This is not claim-precluded at all. They\nthen might proceed with their Federal claim.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, I -- I guess, Justice\nBreyer -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that right or not?\nMR. CASTANIAS: I don't think it's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. CASTANIAS: And -- and I think the reason\nit's not right is because that just shows that there's no\nlive controversy right now. That's a controversy that\nmight happen in the future.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well, but that -- that\nisn't fair to them because, for all I know, they filed the\nFederal case because there's a different statute of\nlimitations, say, that governs it that will have expired\nif you don't let them file it by the time -- until this\nwhole thing is over. They just wanted it as protection.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, two answers to that,\nJustice Breyer. First of all, that seems to be a -- a\nplace for State doctrines of tolling to apply, not Federal\nlaw.\nSecond of all, this Court in -- in Heck against\nHumphrey, which we cited in our brief, solves this -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's explaining the unclear\nby the incredibly hard to understand.\nMR. CASTANIAS: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Justice\nBreyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's explaining the unclear by\nreference to the incomprehensible. But go ahead.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think I wrote that opinion.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CASTANIAS: And indeed, you did, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I never did like it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CASTANIAS: I -- I've also gotten that\nimpression.\nBut -- but Heck I think teaches an important -\nHeck teaches an important lesson for this case as well,\nwhich is that Heck was just a suit for money damages, just\nlike this suit. And -- and yet, this Court said that\nthere's going to be no cause of action under section 1983\nbecause of the intersection of 1983 and habeas. Well, we\nhave the same result here. There should be no Federal\ncourt case here because of the intersection of section\n1257 -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, no, because it's where\nyou walk in the door. And you started out by saying this\ncase, I think as you must, was a proper Federal case. It\nwas properly filed in -- and it was properly filed in\nDelaware. So you can't talk about a case that says, if\nyou've got this kind of case, you go in this door. If\nthat kind of case, you go in that door. You have a case\nhere that could go in either door, the Federal, the State.\nThe usual rule is, is it not, that if Federal\njurisdiction attaches, it doesn't get lost because of\nsubsequent events. For example, if a defendant moves into\nthe plaintiff's State and the only basis for Federal\njurisdiction is diversity, subject matter jurisdiction\nisn't lost, is it?\nMR. CASTANIAS: No, and in fact, the case that's\ncited against us for that proposition, the Freeport\nMcMoran case, makes clear, in the portion of it not cited\nby Exxon Mobil, that that rule is limited to the diversity\ncontext. And it's not -- it -- it does not have its\ngenesis in statute, but it's in policy. We don't want to\nkeep people from moving across State lines. We don't want\nto -- want to impede their -- their free movement. So\nwe're going to look at it at the time of filing.\nBut what we have here is a case where maybe it\nwas original jurisdiction when the case was filed, but\nit's not original anymore.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe. It's not -- it's not\nmaybe -\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, in this case, yes. In\nthis case, yes. But original jurisdiction when the case\nwas filed but not anymore because there's nothing original\nabout it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: A case can become moot, but\nwe've already expressed considerable doubt whether that is\nthe fate of this case.\nThe notion -- you used it derisively -- the\ninsurance policy. Lawyers bring protective actions all\nthe time, don't they? There's nothing wrong with doing\nthat.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, I guess I come back to -\nto where I started with Justice Breyer on the -- on the\nmerits of the Rooker-Feldman issue this morning, which is\nthat the concurrent jurisdiction is something to be dealt\nwith. This Court has an uneasy body of law in the\nabstention area dealing with the issue of concurrent\njurisdiction, but what it doesn't have is anything that\ndeals with judgments, once you get to a judgment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you? It's perhaps\nan unfair question. The Chief Justice generally likes to\nconfine our attention to cases of this Court rather than\nthe courts of appeals for our primary guidance, and most\nof the Rooker-Feldman law is court of appeals law, as we\n-- we both know. Going back just to Rooker and to\nFeldman, those two cases, and putting aside ASARCO for a\nminute, which of those two cases do you think provides you\nthe stronger support, if indeed any support, between\nRooker and Feldman?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, I -- I would have to say\nthat Feldman, of the two of them, is probably stronger\nsupport.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And that is the case in which\nthe court of appeals was itself a party to the litigation.\nMR. CASTANIAS: That's right. But at the same\ntime, the -- the Rooker case also dealt with relitigation\nof the identical issues.\nAnd if I could just sum up here, seeing that the\nlight is on here, the issue in this case is limited to\nidentical lawsuits, identical claims. The Third Circuit's\ndecision in this case, if it constitutes an extension of\nRooker-Feldman at all, is only a modest extension because\nit recognizes, consistent with ASARCO, consistent with\nHeck, and consistent with the very notion, Justice Souter,\nof de facto appeals, not actual appeals, but de facto\nappeals being prohibited by the doctrine -- it recognizes\nthat claims actually litigated in a State suit to a\njudgment, if they are litigated anew in the Federal court,\nthat is de facto appellate review.\nThe judgment of the Third Circuit should be\naffirmed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Castanias.\nMr. Coleman, you have 8 and a half minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. COLEMAN: And I'll take just a few of them,\nYour Honor.\nI believe the concession that the Federal court\nexercised original jurisdiction at the time our case was\nfiled is an important concession because I simply do not\nsee yet still any rationale for this idea of vanishing\noriginal jurisdiction.\nI also see the concession made in response to -\nto your question, Justice Breyer, about what happens if\nthey win on the statute of limitations issue. Well, one\nof the cases they cite on page 12, footnote 5 of their\nbrief, the Northern Natural Gas case itself makes clear -\nand there are other cases. They went to Delaware to apply\nthe Delaware statute of limitations. They conceded in\nfront of the Delaware Supreme Court that even if they had\nwon that, it wouldn't bar another lawsuit in a different\nforum applying a different statute of limitations. The\nonly way they could even hope to get the shorter statute\nwas in Delaware. The Delaware statute would never apply\nto our Federal claims, so that if somehow it went back on\nthat procedural ground, it would not bar a trial in\nFederal court. We don't think that that's likely to\nhappen, but that is another explanation yet of why it's\nmoot.\nWe also cited to the Court the Male case. It is\nan old case, but it does make clear that when there is the\nquestion of jurisdiction before the court and some other\ncourt rules on the merits, that does not make the case\nmoot. In fact, you really wouldn't have a need for claim\npreclusion if that were the rule in -- in mootness,\nbecause once the case is final over there, they'd all be\nmoot, and you wouldn't need to apply -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that depends on who wins.\nMR. COLEMAN: You're right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if you lost in the\nother suit, your claim here wouldn't be moot. I mean, it\n-- it would be precluded, but it's certainly not moot.\nMR. COLEMAN: I -- I think that's right.\nI'd also like to address, just very briefly, the\nASARCO question. The language that the Court used in\nthere we don't necessarily think was loose or\ninappropriate, Justice Ginsburg, and the reason was the\nCourt cites at that point an amicus brief by the United\nStates and it cites a particular footnote. And what that\nfootnote says is it's a recommendation that the mining\ncompany in that case could file a Federal lawsuit seeking\na judgment that the invalidation of the statute was not\nnecessary. But by challenging the invalidation itself,\nthat -- that looks more like a direct challenge to the\nState court judgment. It's not simply a relitigation. So\nthat behind the Court's language there -- and of course,\nit was really just addressing standing. It was not\ndirectly addressing Rooker-Feldman. But the U.S.'s\nsuggestion in that case was a suit challenging the State\ncourt judgment, and in that situation, it looks more like\nappellate review, more likely to infringe upon Rooker\nFeldman-type interests.\nIn the end, we believe that preclusion doctrines\nadequately cover all of this, that it is not true -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Coleman, I don't mean to\ntake your time, but in the ASARCO case, was the State\ncourt judgment final at the time in dispute?\nMR. COLEMAN: Your Honor, there's a question\nabout that. I mean, the Court kept jurisdiction, but\nthere was a determination that the statute was invalidate\n-- was invalid and then a remand back to the district\ncourt for further proceedings.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because if the judgment were\nfinal, then that would fit right into your -- your\nanalysis, if the judgment of the State court were final.\nMR. COLEMAN: Yes, Your Honor, it would.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. COLEMAN: In the -- at the end of the day,\nwe believe that this Court's preclusion jurisprudence is\nnot riddled with vagaries, that it's not difficult to\nunderstand, and that it's certainly not more vague or\ndifficult than the borrowing that they are attempting to\ndo to bring existing preclusion doctrines into -- in order\nto expand Rooker-Feldman.\nPreclusion is the answer in this case. We\nbelieve that the district court should be permitted to\naddress that in the first instance, and we would ask the\nCourt to reverse the judgment of the Third Circuit.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Coleman.\n"
