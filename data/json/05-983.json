        "content": "[10:03 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nthis morning in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City\nSchool District. Mr. Andre.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN-CLAUDE ANDRE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ANDRE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case asks the Court to decide to what\nextent non-lawyer parents of a child with a disability\nmay litigate an IDEA case pro se in Federal court.\nUnder two distinct theories, the answer to that question\nshould be without limitation. But I would like to focus\ntoday on petitioner's primary and first theory, which is\nthat parents are real parties in interest in IDEA suits\nregardless of the claims being asserted.\nUnder 28 USC 1654, a party has a right as a\nmatter of Federal statutory law to litigate their own\ncase. Accordingly, when a parent sues under IDEA, it is\nour position they are suing in their own right and are\nsuing on their own case. This is particularly so\nbecause the right to sue provision that Congress enacted\nin IDEA uses the broad phrase \"any party aggrieved\" when\nit allows judicial review of an adverse administrative\nhearing officer's decision. The parties agree that it\nis the underlying administrative complaint or the due\nprocess complaint that frames both the claims that can\nbe brought eventually in court, and also identifies who\nthe parties are that can appear in court.\nThose complaint provisions in IDEA, and\nthere are eight of them in all we cite in footnote seven\nof our reply brief; all eight of those provisions refer\nunambiguously to the parents' complaints. Congress did\nnot describe this due process complaint that starts the\nwhole dispute process as the child's complaint, the\nchild's complaint by and through the parents, or the\nparents' complaint on behalf of the child.\nAccordingly, when a parent files that due\nprocess complaint, they are the real party in interest,\nand again, the provisions make no distinctions about the\nkinds of claims that can be brought. It shouldn't\nmatter that when they get to Federal court that -- or\nthere shouldn't be any limitation on who is the real\nparty in interest in Federal court, or what claims may\nbe asserted.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we say that the parents\nare the real party in interest and are entitled to sue\nin their own right, is that the end of the case, or do\nwe reach the second -- a second question as to whether\nor not they can represent the children?\nMR. ANDRE: I don't think you would need a\nreach a second question, Justice Kennedy. It's our\nposition that the remedies in an IDEA case are\nco-extensive and that the rights are inseparable. And\nso, this case was pleaded in such a way as to have both\nthe parents and the child be before the court. But if\nthis court were to agree with us on our first and\nprimary theory, we don't believe it would be necessary\nto have the child listed as a plaintiff to a future\nsuit, and we imagine that on remand the child might be\ndismissed from the suit. It's our position that he's\nnot an indispensable party.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What can the parents get\nout of this case other than reimbursement for the\ntuition they've paid to private schools and procedural\nrights that are given them by the Act? What can they\nget out of this case other than those two things that do\nnot depend upon their status as representatives of the\nchild?\nMR. ANDRE: Well, clearly the relief\nprimarily sought by my clients -- in fact, if you look\njust at the relief section of the complaint that my\nclients filed, which is in joint appendix, page 19, the\nonly relief they actually seek is reimbursement.\nThere's a number of ways --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What other possible relief\ncould they seek other than giving them a procedural\nright accorded by the Act? What other possible relief\ncould they seek that they would not be seeking as\nguardians of the child?\nMR. ANDRE: Of course, it's our position\nthat parents are never acting as guardians, at least in\nthe legal sense, or lay representatives of a child in a\ncourt action. And so, therefore, a parent should be\nable to assert any one of the -- a claim asserting\nviolation of any one of the many rights conferred in the\nAct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It depends upon their being\na party aggrieved. That is defined in Black's Law\nDictionary as a party entitled to a remedy.\nMR. ANDRE: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now if the only remedies\nthe parents are entitled to in their own right are\nreimbursement, which is at issue here, and procedural\nguarantees, why would not their ability to sue or to\nappear pro se be limited to those two categories? You'd\nwin this case, but I'm talking about how broad is the\nrule that you're urging us to adopt?\nMR. ANDRE: Well, in -- and this could be a\nvery easy case if the Court wants to look just at the\nspecific procedural violations that my clients assert\nand also the reimbursement claim that they assert. But\nit's of course our position also that the full bundle of\nrights can be asserted by parents. I think maybe the\nbest way to answer your question, Justice Scalia, is\nthat -- to direct you back to the definition of a free\nappropriate public education itself, and that's in\n1401(9) and (29) in the statute. That definition\nprovides that a free appropriate public education is one\nthat's provided at no cost to parents. So if a school\ndistrict provides a free and inappropriate public\neducation, then it's the parents' obligation -- or not\nobligation -- they have the choice of whether to\nsupplement the inappropriate public education with\nadditional services, or to replace the public education\nwith one that provides an appropriate bundle of\nservices.\nSo I guess my point is that even in a case\nwhere the parents don't necessarily seeks reimbursement,\nthey still are intended beneficiaries of the right to a\nfree appropriate --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The child is. The child is\nentitled to an appropriate public education and the\nparents are entitled to have it provided free. That's\nreally the only interest they have on the table, it\nseems to me, separate and apart from their status as\nrepresentatives or guardians of the child.\nMR. ANDRE: We also believe that the parents\nhave an interest in the education being appropriate\nfor -- in addition to the reason I just explained, that\nthey may have to supplement education, but parents are\nalso the co-architects of the individualized educational\nprogram that is eventually -- that eventually defines\nthe bundle of services that it provides the child. And\nthey're integral to the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you say\nthey're the co-architects. I mean, are you saying\nanything more than they are given the procedural right\nto participate in the hearing?\nMR. ANDRE: I think they're given -- I\nhaven't counted them -- but I think they're given 10, 12\nof the 15 procedural rights outlined in the statute.\nAnd this Court explained in Rowley, Congress placed\nevery bit as much emphasis on parental involvement in\nthe shaping of the individualized educational program --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't there a bit\nof -- there's a leap from saying they have these various\nprocedural rights and they're are a party aggrieved by\nthe decision rendered after the hearing, that's a\ndifferent question, isn't it?\nMR. ANDRE: Well, typically a parent would\nfile a due process complaint, challenging the bundle of\nservices offered by the school district, and alleging a\nprocedural violation. And so I think it would be a rare\ncase where a parent would, by the time they get to\nFederal court, try to be a party aggrieved is something\nthat they didn't exhaust -- that would render the\nexhaustion requirement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They are an aggrieved\nparty for purposes of the administrative process. The\nquestion is whether that -- when that is done, whether\nthey also constitute an aggrieved party. And one of\nthe -- one of the points made by the other side is that\nthere is an express provision for proceeding without\ncounsel at the administrative level, and there's no\nprovision for proceeding without counsel in court.\nSo doesn't that suggest that the right to\nproceed pro se is limited to the administrative process?\nMR. ANDRE: No, not at all,\nJustice Ginsburg. Congress sensibly recognized that\nbecause the process proceedings are run on a State by\nState basis, certain unauthorized practice of law\nstatutes or other laws require prohibiting counsel in\nadministrative proceedings might come into play. So\nCongress had to make it express in section 1415(h)(1)\nthat any party may appear in the administrative\nproceedings with or without counsel.\nIn contrast, in Federal court, there's\nalready 28 U.S.C. 1654, which has been on the books\nsince 1789 as part of the Judiciary Act. That provision\nallows any party to litigate their own case. So it\nactually makes a lot of sense that Congress would have\nincluded the express right to proceed pro se --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which just begs the\nquestion, doesn't it? I mean, you're assuming that the\nparents are a party to the case in Federal court.\nMR. ANDRE: Well, again, it is our position\nthat they are because they're parties aggrieved by the\nadministrative proceedings, so long as they have\nexhausted their claims. And that this is confirmed in\nother provisions, for example, the attorneys' fees\nprovision of the statute refers repeatedly to parents as\na possible prevailing party.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought it was the\nunanimous view of the circuits that parents, as a\ngeneral matter, do not have the right to represent their\nchildren in Federal court, that the provision of the\njudicial code that you cited does not confer on parents,\ngenerally, the right to represent children.\nMR. ANDRE: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice. But our primary theory in this case is not\nthat parents are seeking to represent their children as\nlay advocates in court. Our primary theory is that a\nparent suing under the statute is suing in their own\nright. In fact, that's why my clients pleaded this case\nwith -- as -- with themselves on the caption, and\nasserted claims that are their own, because they\nbelieved that those claims are their own, and they\nbelieved they should be able to litigate those claims\nunder section 1654.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know, it's not an\ninsignificant matter at issue here. Counsel, who are\nreferred to as officers of the court, protect the court\nfrom frivolous suits, from suits that really have no\nbasis. When we give that authority to appear in court\nand initiate a suit to the public at large, we make a\nlot more work for Federal district judges. Why should\nwe interpret this statute to achieve that unusual\nresult?\nMR. ANDRE: Well, I'm not sure that the\npolicy considerations would be relevant to the statutory\nconstruction question of whose rights are being asserted\nin a case like this. But certainly under our second\ntheory, the public policy considerations would be\nappropriate.\nIt is our position that those public policy\nconcerns about pro se litigants burdening the court,\nburdening opposing counsel are dramatically outweighed\nby the fact that -- by the reality that two-thirds of\nthe disabled children in the United States come from\nfamilies that cannot afford counsel --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The statute already\nallows the shifting of fees to a prevailing party. So\npresumably attorneys can be found to take the\nmeritorious cases. And What we are probably dealing\nwith are cases that can't attract attorneys, even though\nthe attorneys know that if they win, they will get their\nfees.\nMR. ANDRE: Two responses Mr. Chief Justice.\nFirst, in other regimes, where you have a fee-shifting\nstatute, the cases are usually still brought by pro se\nlitigants. Here because you are dealing with a minor\nchild, really, it is an all or nothing proposition.\nEither bring the case and you have the potential to\nrecover attorneys' fees, or the case doesn't get brought\nat all. And this is borne out by the statistics cited\nin our position and the amicus briefs from the Council\nof Parent Attorneys and Advocates, and the Autism\nSociety of America.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was their an argument at\nany point in this case that the claim was frivolous?\nMR. ANDRE: No, there was not. And then\nthat brings me to my last point, which is, as a\npractical matter, there is a very limited private\nspecial ed bar and they cherry-pick only the best cases.\nBut that doesn't mean that all the cases that are left\nare frivolous or meritless. There's a whole universe of\ncases out there, some of which may be quite strong, some\nof which may be on the borderline, and some which may be\nmeritless.\nBut Congress cannot have intended to create\nthis important and robust substantive statutory\nguarantee to a free and appropriate public education,\nand guarantee all these procedural safeguards, including\njudicial review to enforce it, and then expect that that\nright would never be fulfilled because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if they had\nthat overriding intent, it would have been easy enough\nfor them to make clear that this was an exception to the\nnormal rule, that parents don't have the right to\nrepresent children in court. They did that with respect\nto the administrative proceeding, as Justice Ginsburg\npointed out. They perhaps conspicuously did not do it\nwith respect to the proceeding in court.\nMR. ANDRE: Well, actually, if I could\nclarify one thing. If you look closely at section\n1415(h)(1), it does not provide that a parent can\nrepresent their child in the administrative proceeding.\nIt just says that any party may litigate that\nadministrative proceeding.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know, but 14 -- is\nit 1415(f)? Specifically says that parents have the\nright to participate in the due process hearing. I'm\nlooking at 1415(f)(1)(A). In other words, parents have\nthe right to participate in the due process hearing.\nMR. ANDRE: But that's also -- our position\nis they have the right to participate in the due process\nhearing as parties, in fact as the kind of plaintiff\nside parties. And that is confirmed by the provisions\nthat we cite in footnote seven of our reply brief that\ntalk about the parents' complaint.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't say they\nhave the right to participate as parties. They have --\nit says they have the right to -- for an impartial due\nprocess hearing. I would suppose if you're trying to\nfigure out who is the party to that case, you would\nstill think of it in terms of the child and not the\nparents.\nMR. ANDRE: Well, we thought that -- we\nbelieve that Congress thought of it as the parents\nbecause of all the statutory references to the parents'\ncomplaint. Of course, we don't take the absurd position\nthat the child could not also be a party to those\nproceedings.\nBut in any event, my point was simply that\nthe express Lesesne argument that some courts relied on\nto suggest that Congress consciously decided not to\nallow parental lay representation, I mean, that argument\nsimply doesn't have a strong foundation, because the\nprovision on which that argument is based, which is\n1415(h)(1), is ambiguous at best. And, in fact, could\nsuggest just the opposite.\nI'd like to address a point that Respondents\nhave relied on --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Before you do that, how much\nof a practical benefit would it be for children with\ndisabilities and their parents, if you are successful\nhere, in light of the complexity of the IDEA and the\nfact that this is an area where some parents are going\nto have difficulty maintaining any kind of emotional\ndetachment from the litigation?\nIf parents can represent their -- can -- a\nnon-lawyer parent can appear in court, isn't there a\nrisk that in some instances where a lawyer could be\nfound if the parent made an effort to do that, they're\ngoing to be lured into trying to provide the\nrepresentation themselves?\nMR. ANDRE: Well, first of all, parents\nalready have to get to know the statute and the\napplicable regulations when they bring these cases at\nthe administrative level. By the time they get to\ncourt, they are intimately familiar with the facts and\nintimately familiar with the relevant law. The only\nthing that's different about the court action and the\nadministrative proceeding is now you have the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: These disadvantaged parents\nthat you are referring to who comprise the majority of\nparents, they're really up on section, you know, (h)(1)\nand all that stuff? I find that hard to believe. I\nmean, the people you're assertedly benefiting here are\nthe people least likely to have familiarized themselves\nwith the statute and the procedures.\nMR. ANDRE: I'm not sure we agree, with all\ndue respect, Justice Scalia. But even if that's true,\nthe nature of IDEA court action, I think, addresses some\nof the concern. These are not pure record review\nproceedings, like in merit systems protection board\ncases, or immigration cases. But they are quasi review\nproceedings. And so what we're advocating here is\nreally access to the courts. Let the parents, whether\nthey are brilliant writers or they're not so good at\nwriting, let them at least have access to the courts, so\nthat will then -- a capable district judge can look at\nthe case and decide whether the school should have\ncomplied with the statutory mandates.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And do it right after\nreading pro se prisoner petitions, right? You'd have a\nnice evening's work.\nMR. ANDRE: We think that the pro se parents\nare quite different from pro se prisoners. I'd like to\nsave the rest of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Andre.\nMr. Salmons.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS\nMR. SALMONS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nCongress made parents of children with\ndisabilities parties in their own right in\nadministrative and judicial proceedings under the IDEA,\nand granted parents their own rights under the Act. One\nof the rights granted expressly to parents is the right\nto seek reimbursement for private educational expenses\nwhen the parents believe the school has failed to\nprovide an appropriate education.\nThat is the claim that's at issue in this\ncase, and the parents are clearly the appropriate party\nfor that claim because they're the ones that have\nincurred the financial harm. When they are reimbursed\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That argument proves\na little too much. If you have a child who is the\nvictim of a tort, for example, and suffers a serious\ninjury, it is the parents who are going to have to bear\nthe costs of accommodating that injury. And yet in any\ntort action, it's still the child who is the party and\nnot the parent.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, I think that's right,\nYour Honor, but the difference here is that the statute\nin section 1412(a)(10)(C)(2), and this is on page 6A of\nPetitioner's brief, expressly provides a right to\nparents to seek reimbursement for the -- for their --\nthe educational expenses that they incur.\nAnd while the parents have to show that\nthere was a denial of a free appropriate public\neducation, we think it's clear that the statute makes\nthe claim the parent's claim. And there are cases, for\nexample, out of the Fourth District, in Emery, that\nwould suggest that it is not even clear that the child\nwould have standing to assert a claim for reimbursement\nwhen they're not out of pocket any expenses.\nSo we think in a case like this, this is an\neasy case. We think clearly here the parents are the\nparties.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you would be\nestablishing a right for the least needy. I mean, if\nthey're seeking reimbursement, they're able to pay the\nprivate school tuition. It's the people who can't --\nwho have no alternative, they have to take what the\nschool district gives them because they don't have the\nwherewithal to enroll their child in a private school.\nAnd your argument, concentrating on the reimbursement\nright, would leave out those people, would it not?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, that's not the sum total\nof our argument, Your Honor. I was just pointing out\nthat actually there's a relatively narrow way to decide\nthis case if the Court so chose, by focusing on the\nreimbursement claim in this case.\nOur position is that parents share in the\nsubstantive right to a free appropriate public education\nunder the Act. And there are two things we would point\nto in regard to the definition of a free appropriate\npublic education that we think makes this clear. And\nthis is in section 1401 of the Act on pages 2A and 4A of\nPetitioner's brief.\nThe first is the definition says that the\nterm free appropriate public education means special\neducation services provided, quote, without charge and\nat no cost to parents. We think clearly the free\naspect, again, is first and foremost a right of the\nparents, because they're the ones that bear the cost.\nWith regard to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not following you.\nWhere is this provision? 1401 what?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think you quoted from\n4(a).\nMR. SALMONS: There's -- That's correct.\nThe definition begins on page 2(a) \"which says free\nappropriate public education on section 1401 and it\nsays, \"the term free appropriate public education means\nspecial education related services that -- and under\nsubparagraph A have been provided at public expense\nunder public supervision and direction and without\ncharge -- Then in subparagraph 29 on page 4(a)the term\nspecial education is defined which is again the term\nfrom the definition of free appropriate public\neducation, is defined to mean \"specially designed\ninstructions at no cost to parents.\"\nAnd so again the right to a free appropriate\npublic education is defined expressly in part as terms\nof the parents interest. We also think that regards to\nany question about what is the appropriate, if you look\nback again on 2(a), subparagraph D of the definition of\nfree appropriate public education, it says that it has\nto be special education services that are provided in\nconformity with the individual education program\nrequired under the Act.\nAnd now the individual education program or\nIEP process is the process by which parents are given\nthe right to participate as full members of the IEP team\nand to have a say in helping to define what is an\nappropriate education for the child. And as this Court\npointed out in Rowley, this is the essential feature of\nthis Act. The way it works is that Congress did not\nspecify or flesh out a substantive standard for what is\nappropriate for a child' instead it ensured -- it\nmandated, excuse me -- that an appropriate education is\nan education that involves parental involvement.\nAnd when there is a dispute with regard to\nwhether the IEP team has adopted the right educational\nprogram for the child, we think that the Act makes\nparents, who again, who are full members of that team,\nwhen their views are rejected as far as what is\nappropriate, they are given the procedural safeguard of\ninitiating a due process hearing. Again the Act refers\nrepeatedly to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So their, their\nrights -- so their right to proceed in Federal court\nshould be limited to the rights that you've identified\nunder the statute as opposed to the right to proceed on\nbehalf of the child?\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, you\nthink -- you think their -- their, their rights -- the\nrights they can assert are only ones they can identify\nas their own as opposed to the child's?\nMR. SALMONS: Well it, that is essentially\nour position although I would add that our position is\nthat all of the rights of the statute are rights that\nare shared by the parent. At least with regard to the\nsubstantive --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then you still\nhaven't said anything. I thought you were saying that\nthey can sue for the money and they can sue for denied\nprocedures. But if all the procedures are given and\nthey're still not satisfied with the public education\nthat is given, they would not be able to sue claiming\nthat it was inadequate under the terms of the Act.\nYou think they can sue then, too, as well.\nMR. SALMONS: Yes, Your Honor. We do --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you haven't said\nanything then.\nMR. SALMONS: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You really haven't limited\nthe scope of the parent's right to sue at all.\nMR. SALMONS: Well -- well -- just because I\nhaven't limited the rights of the parents right doesn't\nmean that I haven't been trying to make a point about\nhow to interpret the statute. The statute we think does\nnot limit the parents' rights to sue on behalf of their\nchild and on behalf of their own rights under the\nstatute.\nWe think the way to think about this --\nagain, keep in mind that the right to initiate a due\nprocess hearing and the right to seek review of that in\ncourt, those are rights that are contained in Section\n1415, which is the procedural protection, the procedural\nguarantees of the Act. And we think those are rights\nthat belong to the parents.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Fine. You've given the\nprocedure but where does the Act guarantee the parents\nthe proper outcome? The proper -- assignment?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, we think the way --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It does give the parents\nthe right procedures explicitly and the rights to\nreimbursement for -- for private tuition.\nMR. SALMONS: The -- that -- that's correct.\nThe way we look at the question, Your Honor, is to say\nit gives the parents those rights, it gives the parents\nthe right to be full members of the IEP team that\ndetermines the appropriate education for that child.\nWhile the school district has the final say as far as\nthe contents of the IEP, the parents as members of that\nteam have the right to initiate litigation through\nadministrative procedures and then ultimately in court,\nif their view of what is appropriate for their child is\nrejected by the -- by the -- by the IEP team. And\nwhile, and no doubt --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that right, where --\nwhere is that right contained? You have given us\ncitations for the other ones. Where is that right\ncontained?\nMR. SALMONS: The right to initiate --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The right to initiate a\nsuit solely on the basis -- not that I was denied\nprocedures, not that I, I paid money for private\nschooling, but I do not believe the outcome, the\neducation given to my child in the public school was\nenough.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, what I would refer\nyou to are the many provisions of the Act, and you can\nturn to pages 16 A and 17 A for example of Petitioner's\nbrief that has these, in part, where the Act repeatedly\nrefers to the parents' due process complaint, the\nparents' due process complaint, known as the parents'\nright to a due process hearing. The 2004 amendments\nexpressly refer, define prevailing party to be parents.\nIt referred to the parents' cause of action\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They have the right -- they\nhave the right to the hearing. But do they have the\nright --\nMR. SALMONS: They have a right --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do they have a right in and\nof themselves -- not as guardians -- do they have the\nright to a particular outcome in the hearing? That's,\nthat's the point I'm inquiring to.\nMR. SALMONS: Our way of looking at the\nstatute, Your Honor, says that if they are the ones that\ninitiate the hearing, they file the complaint, they are\nparties to that hearing, then when, when their claims\nare denied, they are parties aggrieved within the\nmeaning of the statute. It's the same term, parties\naggrieved, that refers to the right to an appeal in the\nadministrative process that refers to the ability to\ninitiate a civil cause of action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is not -- it is\nnot just party aggrieved. It's party aggrieved by the\nfindings and decision, as opposed to party aggrieved by\na denial of the procedural right, and those strike me as\ntwo different things.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, I -- does say, it does\nreference back, in fact it references back to the\ncomplaint that's filed to initiate the due process\nhearing. And the parties are the ones that -- excuse\nme, the parents are the ones that are referred to as the\nones filing those complaints. It is referred to\nrepeatedly as the parents' complaint and the parents are\n-- are referred to as prevailing parties in the civil\naction. Again in the attorneys fee provisions that were\nadded in 2004, expressly refer to quote, \"the parents'\ncomplaint or subsequent cause of action.\" This is on\npage 24 A of Petitioner's brief.\nAnd it refers to parents as a prevailing\nparty. There are other provisions that do so as well\nand while we're on the topic of the 2004 amendments -- I\nsee my time is up.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Salmons.\nMr. Bergeron?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PIERRE H. BERGERON,\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. BERGERON: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court.\nThe common law rule banning parental pro se\nrepresentation is as longstanding as it is pervasive.\nAppreciating the fact that the IDEA does not abrogate\nthe common law rule, Petitioners instead seek to\ncircumvent that through this substantive rights theory.\nIf a due process complaint never raised any issue of\nparental substantive rights, nor even did their cert\npetition, which at page 11 said children had substantive\nrights but parents have procedural rights.\nNow, however, they tell this Court that the\nright -- the parents' substantive right is so ingrained\nin the fabric of the statute that the courts should\nrecognize it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How do you classify right\nto reimbursement?\nMR. BERGERON: Your Honor, I would classify\nthat as not a right, it's a remedy. It is a remedy\npremised on the denial of the FAPE to the child. And as\na result, it is simply a derivative claim for the\nparents to recover those funds.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The right to recover\nmoney, it's just a remedy, it's not a right?\nMR. BERGERON: That's, and that's how 1412\nis structured, the provisions about reimbursement. It\ndepends upon the predicate finding that the child was\ndenied a FAPE and therefore one of the remedies, among\nother remedies, compensatory education and so forth, is\nreimbursement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the provision\nthat says at no cost to the parent?\nMR. BERGERON: Your Honor, certainly that\nhas been one of the emphases by Petitioners, but the\nresponse to that is that the free aspect of the free\nappropriate public education does not give parents a\nsubstantive right to the education itself. We are not\ntalking -- we are debating in this case, the merits of\nthis case, we are debating the A aspect, the\nappropriateness. We are not saying, we have not\nexpelled the student and therefore they have a claim\nbased on that. It is simply --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why don't we go back to my\nother question to be sure I got your point. The\nreimbursement is paid to whom?\nMR. BERGERON: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The child or the parents?\nMR. BERGERON: Our position is it would be\npaid to the child. The child would be the party that\ncould bring that claim. And I just would like to\nclarify. If you look at page 153 of the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You reimburse the child\nfor money that his parents spent?\nMR. BERGERON: And Your Honor, that is how\nthe court, lower courts in the Third Circuit, where the\nCollinsgru rule prevails, that's how they apply it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What would -- what would\nhappen if the child were deceased or incompetent?\nMR. BERGERON: Well, that is, that is\nexactly the scenario in the Seventh Circuit case that\nthey cited in 2007. And they said it's, the child's\nestate is the one that brings the claim. Now in that\ncase, the child had actually expended the funds. But\nthat case upheld the rule that we were advocating here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In an instance in which the\nmoney is paid to the -- the reimbursement is paid to the\nchild, how does the child get the money to the parents?\nMR. BERGERON: You've got to assume --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe, maybe these\nchildren don't. Do they set up trust funds for these\nreimbursements?\nMR. BERGERON: Your Honor, I think it is no\ndifferent than a basic attorney fee award. There's not,\nthere's not a claim that -- that, you know, if someone\nelse, if the uncle pays the attorneys' fees that didn't\nnegate the award of fees on behalf of the child.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I'm not talking about\nnegating the award. I'm -- if that theory is sound, if\nthe child is the proper recipient of the reimbursement,\nI presume that ultimately the reimbursement is supposed\nto go to the person who paid the money?\nMR. BERGERON: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Which would be the parent.\nMy question is how does the child in that case get the\nmoney to the parent?\nMR. BERGERON: Well, because the claim would\nhave to be brought on behalf of the child, because they\nwould not have the capacity to bring the claim itself,\nthe award would go straight to the, to the guardian, who\nmay be the parent that is proceeding on their behalf.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the guardian can't the\nfunds that belong to the child.\nMR. BERGERON: Well, but Your Honor, we\nbelieve that that's the pragmatic result that Congress\nintended here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. But if the, if\nthe guardian is in a position to convey the money to\nhimself in the different capacity as the parent, then\nwhy isn't the guardian equally in a, in a position to be\nsubstituted for the child in -- in litigating the\naction?\nMR. BERGERON: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You can't have it -- you\ncan't have it both ways.\nMR. BERGERON: Well, the guardian can\ncertainly bring the claim on behalf of the child. But\nits' different than bringing the claim in their own\nright. And I would point that at page 153 of the joint\nappendix, it specifies at the -- at the administrative\nhearing level, there was no claim for reimbursement to\nthe parents. In fact, what they were seeking was\nreimbursement to Monarch, to the school. In other\nwords, as far as the administrative record disclosed\nthey had not actually paid the funds.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is this to do -- I\nmean, I'm -- I'm puzzled about why we're talking about\nthis complicated thing. I mean why -- the statute as I\nread it has a section and it's called procedural,\nprocedural rights.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it says that the\nprocedural rights, right at the beginning, are for both\nthe children and the parents. And it sets up some\nprocedures in the agency which is for the children and\nthe parents and school board, and everybody is supposed\nto be there. And then another part of the same section\nsays any person aggrieved by the first has a court\nhearing.\nWhy isn't that the end of it? It's clearly\naimed, as the statute is aimed, at both students and\nparents. And then we give them all procedural rights,\nand what in the statute says that the procedures that\nthey're following before the school board happen to be\nfor both parents and students. But without saying a\nword, a different procedure, a Federal court procedure\nin the same section, without saying anything, would be\njust for the students and not for the parents?\nI mean, I find that hard to read the statute\nthat way.\nMR. BERGERON: Well, Your Honor, if you're\ntalking about the distinction between the procedural and\nthe substance in the Act, Congress made clear --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not. I'm talking\nabout the whole Act. Throughout the whole Act, they\ntalk about parents and students.\nMR. BERGERON: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And who writes the check?\nThe student?\nMR. BERGERON: Generally, no, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. Of course. The parent\nwrites the check. And has the interest? I have an\ninterest in educating my children as you do in yours.\nAnd this statute talks about that throughout.\nMR. BERGERON: Just --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I'm looking at the\nparticular words in the procedural section, and the\nparticular words explicitly say that every subsection is\nboth for parent, through child; and then we get to the\nCourt one and it talks about person aggrieved.\nAnd you, I guess, have to convince me --\nwhich as I'm putting it, sounds like an uphill battle --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you have --\nMR. BERGERON: I'll do my best.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You have to convince me\nthat person aggrieved at the at the end of this section\nis meant to apply to only some of the people whom every\nother section talks about, namely just children, not\nparents.\nNow why should I read that it way?\nMR. BERGERON: Well, let me try to explain,\nJustice Breyer. The reason is as Petitioners\neffectively conceded in their reply brief, party\naggrieved does depend on the party entitled to the\nremedy. And if we look at the amendment in\n1415(f)(3)(E), which was just added in 2004, it\nclarifies that all relief that the hearing officer\nshould award is based on substantive violation to the\nchild.\nAnd it's important that if we look to the\nentirety of subchapter 2, there are more than two dozen\nreferences to the right, to the obligation, to the\nprovision of a FAPE to the child. That is what we are\ntalking about. The dispute resolution provisions hinge\non vindicating the child's right. And I think the\nquestion earlier to Mr. Salmons was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's that section you\njust alluded to? I'm blasting by it. Where is it, in\nthe --\nMR. BERGERON: I'm sorry, which section?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: F --\nMR. BERGERON: Oh, 1415(f)(3)(E}, I'm\nfocusing on 21 A of the blue brief, Your Honor. And\nonce that section --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 21 A or -- -\nMR. BERGERON: 21 A of the blue brief, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And which is the statutory\nsection again.\nMR. BERGERON: It's 1415(f)(3)(E).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said 14.\nMR. BERGERON: (f)(3)(E).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are you sure it's not\n18(a)?\nMR. BERGERON: (f)(3)(E) is on 21a of my\nversion of the blue brief, Your Honor. That's the\nprovision that's titled decision of the hearing officer,\nand provides that the hearing officer should grant\nrelief on substantive grounds.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's in 18(a) of mine, too.\nMaybe I have a different brief there.\nMR. BERGERON: That's not my brief, Your\nHonor, I apologize. In any event, it limits the hearing\nofficer's ability to reward relief based on the\nsubstantive, whether the substantive right to the FAPE\nhas been awarded or not. And then we return to\nJustice Breyer's point about the party aggrieved, the\nparty aggrieved by the finding or decision. Because the\ndecision is limited to substantive grounds, that is what\nwe are really talking about here. And I think one of\nthe confusing aspects about what the nature of the\nsubstantive right is, and I think we've heard some\ndifferent versions of that this morning, is what is the\nscope.\nPetitioners in their reply brief seem to try\nto retreat a little bit and make the rights more\npalatable. But if they -- in doing so, the question is,\nwhat is the right different than the child's right? And\nwe simply do not have the answer to that, and for the\nschool districts applying this act on a daily basis, and\nfor courts interpreting it, it simply poses numerous\nproblems trying to apply to a parent a statute that was\ndesigned to benefit children.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your argument, I guess, is\nthis argument. Now you're conceding the parent does\nhave a right to go to court, but he can only complain\nabout something that hurts him. Right?\nMR. BERGERON: I would not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He can't complain in court\nor -- well, it sounds as if you were saying that.\nYou're saying that the hearing officer has to decide\nagainst the parent and if he doesn't decide against the\nparent, obviously the parent can't go into court because\nhe doesn't have anything to complain about, the parent.\nIsn't that your point?\nMR. BERGERON: Well, he can't decide against\nthe parent because the only issue at stake is the right\nof the child.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well -- right. I'm\nsorry. Then you go ahead. I thought I heard you say\nthat the problem is that the parent didn't have a right\ntaken away by the hearing officer, and that's why the\nparent can't go to court.\nMR. BERGERON: Well, he won't have a right\ntaken away from him because it's not -- it's not his\nclaim at stake in the due process hearing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I would agree, we can\nbe on the same grounds there.\nMR. BERGERON: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I agree that if the parent\nisn't hurt, if the parent wasn't deprived of anything,\nthe parents can go to court but doesn't have anything to\ncomplain about, you know, whereas another section of the\nstatute says that reimbursement is something supposed to\nbe reimbursement for the parent, so it would seem as if\nthe panther has something to complain about. Isn't that\nso? It says the -- I think so -- it says a parent is to\nbe reimbursed. I thought that was one of the things\nthat --\nMR. BERGERON: That's correct, Your Honor.\nThat's what it says.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, now it looks as if the\nparent has something to complain about. The parent\nhasn't got the money that he was supposed to get. Now\nwe have something to complain about, so therefore, we're\naggrieved, and then the last section says an aggrieved\nperson can go to court.\nMR. BERGERON: Right. We simply feel that\nbecause the reimbursement, as I said before, hinges on\nthe deprivation of the right to the child and not the\ndeprivation of the substantive right to the parent, it\nis the child's claim to bring. I appreciate --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Bergeron, I have a\nbasic conceptual problem, both with that response and\nwith your larger argument. Leaving aside how we should\nclassify the reimbursement right or classify\nreimbursement, you make a broad distinction between the\nsubstantive right of the child to the free appropriate\npublic education and on the other hand, the procedural\nrights of the parent in going through the process that\nultimately comes to a conclusion for the child's\nbenefit.\nThe conceptual problem I have is that I\ndon't understand why it makes sense to say that the\nparents have procedural rights unless that procedural --\nor unless those procedural rights of the parents are in\naid of some substantive entitlement for the parents. We\ngive procedural protection to people in order to\nvindicate some substantive interest that they can claim,\nand you're, in effect, splitting those two apart.\nYou're saying one person has a substantive right, the\nother people have procedural right. And I don't see\nconceptually how you can make that split. And if you\ndon't make that split, then it only makes sense that the\nright to the free public -- the free appropriate public\neducation is, as the statute in one place seems to say,\na right of the family group, the parents and the child\ntogether, rather than the right of the child alone.\nSo conceptually, how do you defend the\ndistinction that you make between substantive rights on\none person and procedural rights in another?\nMR. BERGERON: And here's how I would\nexplain it, Justice Souter.\nThe right, the substantive right is the\nright to a FAPE to the child. And because the child\ndoes not have capacity, Congress implemented a pragmatic\nsystem to allow the parents to protect those rights.\nIt's derivative for the parent to protect the child's\nright --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why don't we say that\nthey are the procedural rights of the child and the\nparents are simply stepping into the child's shoes to\nvindicate them?\nMR. BERGERON: That is exactly what 1415(m)\nsays, Your Honor. That allows a transfer of rights.\nAnd 1415(m) is at 11a and 12a of the red brief, and I\nhope I've got the cite right this time. 1415(m) allows\nfor states to require, and Ohio does, to require the\ntransfer of all rights under subchapter 2 that a parent\nwould otherwise have, straight to the child. So\nbasically --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's when the child\nreaches majority.\nMR. BERGERON: That's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The child is no longer a\nchild, the child is an adult.\nMR. BERGERON: And that's my -- that's part\nof what I was trying to say.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm sorry. You go ahead.\nMR. BERGERON: Oh. Well, what I'm trying to\nsay is because the child lacks capacity, they can't do\nall these things on their own until they reach majority.\nBut once they do and the rights transfer, it illustrates\nthat it's not really the parents' rights, it is the\nchild's right that they are protecting.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what stands in\nthe way of that analysis is the text, which says all\nother rights accorded to parents under this subchapter\ntransfer to the child.\nNot only doesn't that help you, it seems to\nme it hurts you. It acknowledges that there are rights\naccorded to parents.\nMR. BERGERON: Right. And those would be\nthe procedural safeguards that are delineated in the\nAct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But then you were denying\nthem, as I understood the argument.\nMR. BERGERON: Well, let me clarify then. I\nwasn't denying the existence of the procedural\nsafeguard. To the contrary, what I'm saying is that\nthey are not redressible independent of themselves in\nFederal court unless -- and this is what 1415(f)(3)(E)\nclarifies, is that you have to have a substantive\nviolation. Because if you think of a situation in which\nthe child is provided a FAPE, no one disputes that, but\na parent says well, you didn't invite me to a meeting,\nwhat's your remedy there? There is no remedy. And\nthat's what Congress was trying to clarify.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that the problem? On\nthe analysis that you're coming up with, parents end up\nwithout even the procedural rights, because you're\nsaying the only person who can basically invoke a\nviolation of procedural right is the person whose been\ndenied the substantive right. The parent hasn't been\ndenied the substantive right. Therefore, the parent\ncannot invoke even the procedural right which ostensibly\non your own analysis, the parent has been given. That\ncan't be correct.\nMR. BERGERON: Your Honor, if you look at --\nI'll direct you to the DiBuo case and the Lesesne case,\nI'm probably mispronouncing both of them --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but before you direct\nme to cases --\nMR. BERGERON: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's wrong with the\nanalytical point that I just made?\nMR. BERGERON: Well, Your Honor, the --\nthat's what Congress was trying to clarify in 2004.\nThey did not want technical procedural violations to\neclipse the substantive rights, and so what they\nprovided was the substantive right is the only one that\nis important.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but instead of saying\nthey're not eclipsed, you're saying they are totally\nblocked out. Because you analysis, I thought was, in\nresponse to my earlier objection, that the procedural\nright, in fact, can only ultimately be invoked for the\nvindication of the substantive right. And because the\nsubstantive right is the child's, not the parents, it\nwould follow that the parents cannot even invoke their\nprocedural rights, and we know that that can't be\ncorrect.\nMR. BERGERON: Right, and I'm not saying\nthat the parent -- the parent's procedural rights are\ngone. I mean, remember --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if the parent's\nprocedural rights are not gone, then the parents must be\nable to invoke those procedural rights based on what\nthey claim to be a denial of some substantive\nentitlement. You're saying that's the entitlement of\nthe child, but if the parents are going to have any\nprocedural right worth having, they've got to invoke it\nfor the purpose of vindicating that substantive right;\nisn't that correct?\nMR. BERGERON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Then why do not the\nparents, when they are claiming that they are aggrieved,\nhave as much right to make a claim that goes to the\nsubstantive denial as to the procedural denial, simply\nbecause the two are inseparable?\nMR. BERGERON: Your Honor, because that --\nagain, that was what Congress was trying to clarify in\n2004. And if you look at the DiBuo case and the Lesesne\ncase cited on page 27 of the SG's brief, both those\ncases make clear that notwithstanding procedural\nviolations, there must actually be a causation, there\nmust actually be substantive harm before any relief can\nflow from that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does a parent have a\nright to bring a 1983 action if their procedural rights\nunder this statute are interfered with by the state\nactors?\nMR. BERGERON: Your Honor, if the parent\nwould otherwise have a 1983 claim under 1415(l), if it\nrelates to an IDEA claim, there would have to be\nexhaustion first.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think I understand\nyour argument based on 3(E), but when I look at 21a of\nmy blue brief there's another provision on attorneys'\nfees and it's phrased in a very curious way. It says\nthat fees are allowed to a prevailing party who is the\nparent of a child with a disability. It seems to me\nthat's the most difficult express language for you to\ndeal with. It doesn't say attorneys' fees happen to be\nallowed to parents, it's to a prevailing party who is a\nparent. And I understand your argument to be that a\nparent can never be a prevailing party.\nMR. BERGERON: That's right. And let me try\nto explain why. If you look at 1411(e)(3)(E), which is\n5a of the red brief, and I'm sorry to keep jumping\nbriefs on you, that provides that litigation brought to\nsecure the right of the child to a FAPE is brought on\nbehalf of the child. So Congress added both that\nsection and the section you were just referring to at\nthe same time, and the only way to read them\nharmoniously is that any action that is being brought on\nbehalf of the child to secure the FAPE, it's not the\nparent's own action that they are bringing, they are\nbringing it on their own -- on behalf of the child.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was the section you\ncited?\nMR. BERGERON: 1411(e)(3)(E), on 5a of the\nred brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: (e)(3)(E).\nMR. BERGERON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Legal fees. The\ndisbursements under subparagraph (d) shall not support\nlegal fees, court costs, or other costs associated with\nthe cause of action brought on behalf of a child with a\ndisability to ensure a free and appropriate public\neducation for such child.\nWhat do you think that proves?\nMR. BERGERON: What I'm saying is Congress\nrecognized that when legal action is being brought to\nsecure FAPE, just like it's the child's right to the\nFAPE under subchapter 2, it is being brought on behalf\nof the child. And that's where petitioners run into\nproblem with the common rule law, because the common law\nrule that they don't dispute is that parents cannot\nbring claims on behalf of the child pro se. So they\nhave to find a way to abrogate, and they initially\nargued in the opening brief for an exception to the\ncommon law rule, which from my reading of the reply\nbrief they have abandoned. So the core issue in dispute\nas far as the petitioners go is what is the nature of\nthe substantive right.\nAnd I'd like to make the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's a section you\npointed to that says disbursements under subparagraph\n(d), but your brief doesn't include subparagraph (d).\nMR. BERGERON: It's the high cost, one of\nthe high cost funds for states, Justice Ginsburg.\nI'd like to make --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well then, if this\nprovision is limited to subparagraph (d), how can you\nargue that it covers the waterfront?\nMR. BERGERON: Well, Your Honor, I think\nit's indicative of what Congress appreciated the claim\nwould look like on any level, and it's not simply saying\nthat those funds aren't provided under subparagraph (d).\nThat is the nature of the claim. Regardless of under\nwhat section we are looking at, that is the nature of\nthe claim that could be brought in order to secure a\nFAPE for the child, and in every circumstance, it is\nbrought on behalf of the child.\nYour Honor, I'd like to make one point, if I\ncan, about the spending clause, in response to\npetitioner's argument in the reply brief.\nPetitioners effectively say that the\nspending clause doesn't apply because this is not an\nissue of liability. I'd like to direct your attention\nagain to Rowley, where at footnotes 11 and 26 the Court\nrecognized the difference between the educational\nbenefit which is the FAPE, and maximizing the\neducational outcome.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are attorneys' fees\nallowed to a parent who is bringing one of these cases\non behalf of a child pro se?\nMR. BERGERON: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a convoluted\nquestion. Okay. So there's no issue under the spending\nclause that a non-attorney parent would be able to claim\nsome sort of attorneys' fees?\nMR. BERGERON: That's what -- I think there\nhave been four circuits who addressed that in the\ncontext of attorney parents, and they've all said that\nthey cannot get fees.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how is the\nspending clause issue very significant in terms of the\nexposure of the school boards?\nMR. BERGERON: Well, Arlington did not limit\nit to simply liability. It said repeatedly obligations\nand conditions. And that's exactly what Rowley was\nlooking at in footnotes 11 and 26. We don't necessarily\nhave -- have to have a line item that there's going to\nbe X dollars in damage. It was simply the difference\nbetween an educational benefit and maximizing that\nbenefit that triggered spending cost concerns in Rowley.\nJust like in South Dakota v Dole the issue of whether\nsomeone was 21 in order to consume alcohol was not\nnecessarily a liability but it was a very important\nobligation or condition imposed upon the State.\nAnd their second point regarding the\nspending clause is that not every single detail needs to\nbe fleshed out in clear notice.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I take it your argument\nis, your red brief argument is that Congress said,\nstates, if you get some judgments against you and they\naward attorneys' fees, you pay for it, we won't? Is\nthat what it said?\nMR. BERGERON: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You don't pay for it, you\ncan't pay for it out of the grant?\nMR. BERGERON: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So we're not paying\nfor this, you pay for it. Is that right?\nMR. BERGERON: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE BREYER: States --\nMR. BERGERON: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- if some people bring\nclaims against you under this because you didn't have a\ngood plan for the child and your attorneys' fees are\nawarded against you, don't pay for it out of this grant.\nIsn't that what you're saying it says?\nMR. BERGERON: Well, Your Honor, it's a\nlittle bit different because part of the -- part of the\nreal issue here is not necessarily an award of\nattorneys' fees to the other party, but it's the\nincurrence of attorneys' fees defending --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought what your\nargument was -- and if it's not, forget it, it's just\nthat I don't understand it. That here the Government\nsays pay for this out of your own pocket, and then its\ndefines what you're supposed to pay out of our own\npocket is, as a parent representing a child, not his own\naction.\nAnd then later on they say, they define it\ndifferently. They talk about prevailing party. The\nparents of the prevailing party. But you say that\nsecond phrase must mean the first phrase. Because it\nwouldn't make sense for the Government to say pay for\nthat out of the grant but not this out of the grant.\nThat's your argument?\nMR. BERGERON: And -- I think that's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. It is an argument.\nMR. BERGERON: And -- and just to clarify,\nCongress hasn't provided any funds for this. I mean\nthey, they recognized in 2004 they were only funding 19\npercent of the obligations of the statute, and we have\nto pick up the balance of the tab.\nAnd their other argument on the spending\nclause is that it's, you don't have to flesh out\neverything in the statute but here we're talking about\ntwo core issues. One is abrogating the common rule law\nand the other is creation of substantive rights to an\nentirely new class of beneficiaries.\nIf there's ever anything that demanded clear\nnotice, this is it. It is much more serious and severe\nthan the expert fees at issue in Arlington, and school\ndistricts and states simply have to have notice, what is\nthe parameter of the right that you are being requested\nto recognize? And based on the briefing, and based on\nwhat we have heard in argument, it is simply not clear\nto the school districts not only what the nature of the\nright is but how to apply it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's where I\nhave a little bit of trouble. It's not -- the\nunderlying right is still the same. It's the right of\nthe child to a free and appropriate public education.\nAnd that can be vindicated in court actions by attorneys\nwho get their fees paid if they prevail, and all we're\ntalking about is a situation where the parents can\nassert that same right when an attorney won't.\nAnd I'm just wondering how significant\nadditional exposure we're talking about? And what turns\non that is whether to take the spending clause argument\nseriously or not.\nMR. BERGERON: Well -- and I think the\nanswer to that is it's still not clear to me from --\nfrom listening to the argument today, I mean, Petitioner\nacknowledged the child falls out of the equation.\nThis is a statute that needs to benefit the\nchild, and they're taking the child completely out. And\nso what is the nature of this parental right? The SG\nsays well, it's all, it's all intertwined. But if we\nlook at what Petitioner said --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So if you agree we're\ntalking about. What is the toll on the states, it seems\nto me that if the state would have to pay for a lawyer,\nif it lost, and that parents who brings the case is not\nentitled to reimbursement, how is the state's pocketbook\naffected?\nMR. BERGERON: Justice Ginsburg, in\nlitigating this case while the Winkelmans were pro se,\nwe expended far greater than the $8,000 at issue in\nArlington, on our legal fees defending --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. But you\nwould have had to do that if they had gotten a lawyer to\ntake the case. What, what your spending clause argument\nis, the State agreed to undertake this liability, that\nthey would have to provide a free and appropriate\neducation, that if they litigated, they would have pay\nthe other side's attorneys' fees. But if they knew that\nin the case where an attorney wouldn't take it, the\nparents could prosecute it, and that might result in\noverturning their decision and that might result in\ngreater expense, well, in that case they would not have\nbought into this deal at all. That seems a little\nimplausible.\nMR. BERGERON: Well, Mr. Chief Justice,\nremember at the time the Congress reauthorized in 2004,\nevery circuit that had addressed it besides the First\nhad agreed that parents could not bring a pro se. So\nthe states reasonably would not have believed,\nespecially in the circuits where it was decided, that\nthey would have to -- have to come up with these funds.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not disputing\nthat it results in additional exposure. I'm just\ndisputing that it affects the voluntariness of their\nagreement to undertake the program.\nMR. BERGERON: Well, if you, in the dissent\nin Arlington, they made -- Justice Breyer made a\nbasically materiality argument and the majority did not\nseem moved by it. So I think, this is something that is\nvery significant, not simply on the dollars involved,\nbut how we apply this substantive right to parents that\nPetitioners seek to have recognized.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the court appoint\nthe parent guardian ad litem and just the parent proceed\nas guardian ad litem?\nMR. BERGERON: That wouldn't solve the issue\nof, under the common law the guardian ad litem would not\nhave the ability to receive pro se on the common law\nfees, the same as the parent. The rule is the same. So\nthey would still have --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The guardian ad litem\ncannot proceed pro se?\nMR. BERGERON: That's right. Unless they're\n-- unless they have -- unless they are an attorney.\nWhich in many cases the appointment to someone who is an\nattorney.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Bergeron, on, one of\nthe points you made on the spending clause argument, I\nthought, was that if there are lawyers representing the\nparents, the lawyers are going to screen out the more\nfrivolous cases. If they are not, more frivolous cases\nare going to be brought. And there's -- there's an\nintuitive appeal to that argument.\nDo we have any -- any figures on the\ncomparative numbers of frivolous cases in lawyer\nrepresentation and pro se representation under the Act?\nMR. BERGERON: Justice Souter, we don't\nbecause most of the circuits were saying this is --\nwe're not going to allow pro se --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We don't have any First\nCircuit numbers --\nMR. BERGERON: No.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- versus other numbers?\nMR. BERGERON: No we checked and couldn't\nfind anything, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Bergeron.\nMr. Andre, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN-CLAUDE ANDRE,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. ANDRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI would like to turn briefly to Respondents'\nassertion that Petitioners somehow waived their claim to\nreimbursement by not exhausting it below. We addressed\nthis in our reply brief, but if the Court wishes to look\nat pages 78 and 88 of the joint appendix, particularly\npage 78, there it is clear that the Petitioners were\nseeking reimbursement in their own right.\nOn the page 153, that Respondent refers to,\nI assume that that point in time we were now on appeal\nto the second tier of the Ohio administrative\nproceeding, and perhaps at that point in time, Monarch\nSchool was actually paying for Jake's education on a\ngrant-like basis, because that was something that\nhappened in this case. And that perhaps at that point\nin time Petitioners referenced reimbursement to Monarch\nbecause Monarch had actually been expending the fund.\nBut by and large my clients expended the funds to\neducate Jake at Monarch School, and they certainly did\nexhaust that claim to reimbursement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you claiming that\nhiring an attorney would be a cost, if the phrase \"at no\ncost to the parent,\" if they have to hire an attorney,\nthat the cost --\nMR. ANDRE: Certainly. And I mean, I think\nthat's why Congress included the attorneys' fee\nprovision in 2004 that recognized that parents can be\nprevailing parties. And if they prevail on establishing\nthat a free appropriate public education has not been\nprovided, then they can recover attorneys' fees as part\nof their, their right to try to vindicate Congress's\npurposes at no cost to them.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why didn't\nCongress just add the provision making this very clear\nthat the Senate had passed, why did the House boot it\nout of the conference bill?\nMR. ANDRE: We don't know. The legislative\nrecord is entirely silent. But one plausible inference\ncould be, could be reached based on looking at the\naddition of attorney's fees provision and the timing of\nthe Maroni decision in the First Circuit. Maroni came\ndown after the parental lay representation provision was\nproposed by the Senate.\nMaroni was the first court of appeals case\nto recognize that parents may litigate these cases pro\nse. The way Maroni did it however was by adopting our\nprimary argument here today, which is that parents\npossess the right to -- to sue in their own name, as pro\nse litigants, not as lay representatives of their\nchildren, and seek to enforce the full bundle of rights.\nCongress very well could have looked at\nMaroni and said aha, that's what we intended all along;\nMaroni got it right, and then they just put -- Congress\njust put the thumb on the scale a little bit by enacting\nthe attorneys fee provision which made it clear that\nparents can be, or are the prevailing party if the\nplaintiffs prevail in an IDEA action.\nFinally, I would like to address two -- two\npoints about the spending clause. Of course we believe\nthe spending clause is totally inapplicable, but I want\nto respond to Respondent's suggest that we're advocating\ncreation of a new substantive right here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you think\nit's totally inapplicable?\nMR. ANDRE: We think that this Court's\nspending clause jurisprudence is concerned with\nproviding clear notice to states with respect to\nliability and certain fiscal obligations. And what\nRespondent is complaining about here --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Please --\nMR. ANDRE: Oh, what Respondent is\ncomplaining about here is essentially a disparate\nimpact. And this Court has never recognize a disparate\nimpact claim under the spending clause.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think it is\nnot violated, not that it doesn't apply for some reason?\nThere is no doubt this is spending clause legislation,\nright?\nMR. ANDRE: Well, absolutely spending clause\nlegislation. But we believe that the clear notice\nconcerns of the spending clause are not even implicated.\nBut that if the clear notice concerns were implicated,\nthe statute is -- clear.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
