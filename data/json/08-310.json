        "content": "(10:18 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument this morning in Case 08-310, Polar Tankers v.\nCity of Valdez.\nMr. Rothfeld.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice\nand may it please the Court:\nThe Valdez vessel tax violates the\nConstitution's Tonnage Clause because it operates as a\ncharge on a privilege of trading in the port of Valdez,\nand that tax is apportioned in a way that is guaranteed\nto tax extraterritorial values and values that do not\nhave a connection to the city. That violates the Due\nProcess and Commerce Clauses.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not often that we\nhave disagreements as to the basic facts. The red brief\nsays that the tax in question constitutes 11 percent of\nthe tax base, and you talk about that in the reply\nbrief. Can you spend just a little bit of time at the\noutset telling us your views of this tax? And although\nit's the Respondent's statement and not yours, do you\nthink 11 percent of the tax base means 11 percent of\nwhat's collected under this tax or under all taxes\nimposed by City of Valdez?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that it means\nall taxes that are imposed not only by the City of\nValdez, but they are including taxes imposed by the\nState of Alaska that are collected by the City of\nValdez. The --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In which case, that seems\nreally quite irrelevant.\nMR. ROTHFELD: That is our position. We\nthink that's absolutely right. I think it is useful to\nfocus on the nature of this tax. It is a tax that is\ndirected exclusively at vessels and not on all vessels.\nIt's -- by exempting small boats and all boats that are\nengaged in commercial fishing and all boats that dock\nexclusively at city-owned harbors. This is a tax, a\nproperty -- it's calls a property tax, but it's a tax\nthat falls only on vessels and is directed at those\nvessels, that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, some -- some of those\nvessels, I take it, are taxed under other statutes. Is\nthat correct?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I think -- I think not. I\nthink that -- so far as Valdez is concerned, the vessels\nwe are talking about are subject simply to this property\ntax.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you -- do you take\nthe position -- let's say that if the State of Alaska\ntaxed all the other property you had mentioned except\nfor the tankers and the city taxed the tankers, that\nthat would by definition be discriminatory tax and/or on\nsome other basis violate the Tonnage Clause?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that would be\nquite a different situation than what we have here.\nHere, the city --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the reason I raised\nit was that -- in -- in your response to my first\nquestion, you said, well, you didn't think the city was\ntaxing these other -- these other pieces of property,\nand I'm -- I'm not sure why that is significant.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, there are -- there's a\nhuge universe of personal property that could be taxed\nin the City of Valdez. Valdez has the authority to tax\nall of this property except for a discrete category of\noil and gas property that is subject to taxation by the\nState. So Valdez can tax all the ordinary kinds of\npersonal property -- movable property, personalty --\nthat any jurisdiction can tax. They can tax cars and\ntrucks and moving vans and refrigerators and jewelry.\nOf all those innumerable things that they could tax,\nthey have chosen to tax a single item. They have chosen\nto tax vessels and, as I said, not all vessels.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but you -- you want us\nto ignore the -- the State tax. Do you really want us\nto do that? I mean, it would be the easiest thing in\nthe world for the State of Alaska, instead of imposing\nit at the State level, to authorize the municipality to\ndo it. I don't want this case to come back here for a\nsecond time.\nMR. ROTHFELD: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now -- now that the\nmunicipality is imposing the taxes that the State used\nto impose, don't you think you have to count both of\nthem?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I -- I don't think so. The\nState of Alaska treats oil and gas property as --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You are going to get a\nfragile judgment if -- if we go on those grounds. All\nit takes is a modification of the -- of the legislation.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Not so, Your Honor, because\nState of Alaska takes very seriously it's stewardship of\noil and gas property. That is something of tremendous\nfiscal importance to the State of Alaska. I think that\nthere is little practical risk that the State is going\nto assign the right to tax that property.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How about the risk in the\nother direction, that the State will simply take over\nthis tax and remit the proceeds to the city? Would the\nresult on your view be the same if it did that?\nMR. ROTHFELD: The result in my view would\nbe the same, but that would be a different and more\ndifficult case. Here, focus on what Valdez is doing:\nIt is -- it has the authority, as I said, to tax the\nuniverse of personalty in the City of Valdez. It has\nchosen to tax only particular types of vessels that are\nused in the export of oil. Imagine, though --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There are other vessels,\ntoo. It's the -- it's the oil tankers, and there are a\nfew other vessels that were included?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Including a -- a cruise\nship is covered. I --\nMR. ROTHFELD: There is -- there is one\ncruise ship, Your Honor, that was caught up in the net\nin the first year the tax was imposed. Otherwise the\ntax falls exclusively on what vessels that are involved\nin the export of oil -- principally tankers, also\nservice vessels.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why does that -- why\ndoes that matter? I mean, do you concede that if this\ntax were in some sense nondiscriminatory, you would\nlose?\nMR. ROTHFELD: No, I think that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why are we having\nall this talk about -- in other words, you think if\nthere was a tonnage tax applicable to everything -- you\nknow, your pickup truck holds two tons; it has got to\npay a certain amount or whatever. Then do you lose or\nwin?\nMR. ROTHFELD: If a -- if a tonnage tax --\nlook at what the tonnage tax was initially designed to\ndo. The Framers chose the term \"duty of tonnage\"\nbecause at the time -- the time this clause was it was\nwritten in the late 18th century, tonnage was the\nordinary way of valuing the value of a ship and the\nordinary way of imposing tax on a ship.\nIf -- if the City of Valdez were to impose a\nproperty tax measured by tonnage on everything -- on\nvans and trucks and refrigerators and ships -- that\nwould be a difficult case for us. But, obviously, it\nhasn't done that. It has not imposed a tonnage tax or\nand it has not imposed a property tax on any other type\nof property except particular types of vessels.\nI think you apply the duck test: It looks\nlike a duck --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think you're --\nMR. ROTHFELD: -- it quacks like a duck --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. I think you're\ngiving up an awful lot. I mean, what if the Framers --\ncouldn't they be have been more concerned about making\nsure that there is a free flow of commerce, that ships\ngo, and the fact that everything is taxed would be less\nof a concern to them? But you're -- you're willing to\nsay that if it's nondiscriminatory, even if you would\ncall it a \"tonnage tax,\" you lose?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I was using a\nresponse to the previous question, and actually they\nwere imposing a property tax and they were measuring it\nin an unusual sort of way. And the Court has said that\nif there's a generally applicable property tax which\nhappens to fall on vessels, the reality of that tax is\nthat it is a tax on property and not a tax on vessels.\nBut here we have quite the opposite. Here\nwe have tax that falls only on vessels as cargo --\nvessels. And you're quite right: The Framers were\nconcerned with the free movement of commerce. The\nTonnage Clause was designed to close the loophole that\nwas thought to be left by the Import-Export Clause,\nwhich bars the taxation of imports and exports. Taxing\nvessels would be a way of circumventing that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let's -- let's assume that\nyou're -- that a given tanker came into the harbor at\nValdez on one occasion and one occasion only. Would the\nCity of Valdez, under its own statutes, by the terms of\nits own ordinance, tax that ship?\nMR. ROTHFELD: It would, indeed, because the\ncity in its code creating the tax conclusively presumed\nthat a vessel was subject to the tax so long as it takes\non cargo worth a million dollars over the course of a\nyear. Oil tankers --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let me -- let me just\nchange the question then. If -- if it came in and sort\nof took half a tankful that didn't reach the point of a\nmillion dollars' value, there would be no tax then. Is\nthat correct?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, it would have to take a\nlot less than half a tankful. I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Whatever it would take to\nget it under the minimum.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Yes. If -- if it were not --\nif it visited the port of Valdez once and took on less\nthan a million dollars and never came back to the port\nof Valdez --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Under the old\ntonnage laws, wouldn't that ship in the 18th century\nhave been taxed?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I think that they --\njurisdictions impose all kinds of different variations\nof tonnage duties. And as the Court --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the -- the point that\nI am getting to is -- and I'd -- I'd like you to address\nthis -- one of the arguments on the other side is that\none reason this should not be treated as a tonnage tax\nis that it relies upon the concept of a tax situs. And\nthe -- the implication is that not every ship that comes\ninto the harbor is going to be subject to the tax;\nwhereas, under the old tonnage laws, any ship that came\nin would be. And what is -- what is your response to\nthat argument?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, two responses. First,\nI think it is not the case that under the old tonnage\nlaws necessarily every ship was subject to tax. Ships\ncould be subject depending upon how -- how large they\nwere, and some ships could be exempted. So I think it's\nnot implicit in -- in the nature of a tonnage duty that\nit applies to every ship that -- that enters the harbor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Where do we -- where do we\nlook to find this out?\nMR. ROTHFELD: One would have to look at the\npractice in the 18th and 19th centuries. And some of\nthe Court's decisions --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you know of any source\nthat we could look at to support the proposition that\nyou just made?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I -- I can't point you to any\nauthority directly addressing the point, but I can point\nyou to the general treatment of what a tonnage duty is.\nI mean, it's a duty which is imposed on vessels on the\nbasis of tonnage. It -- it does not have to be imposed\non every vessel that enters the harbor. But I think\nprobably the more important response to your question is\nthe reality of this tax.\nValdez knew what it was doing. It wanted to\ntarget -- it was commendably candid in saying what it\nwas doing. It wanted to target the vessels that were\nengaged in the transport of oil. It knows how big oil\ntankers are. It knows that the tankers are always full.\nWhen they come in, they take a full load of oil. That's\n-- that is the whole point of --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't -- you\ndon't suggest that it matters, right? You -- you have\ntalked to some extent in the briefs about the bad --\nevil motive.\nMR. ROTHFELD: No, I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you are not\ngoing to suggest that the same tax could be valid or\ninvalid depending on why it was enacted.\nMR. ROTHFELD: No, I -- I don't, but I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: May I ask one other\nquestion before you leave this, which is where Justice\nKennedy started? Suppose a State says: In our State,\nwe want to tax all oil and gas property, and here's how\nwe do it. We assess the value of all oil and gas\nproperty, ships and everything else included. Then we\nimpose a tax of 20 mills per dollar of assessed value,\nsomething like that, on all of it.\nNow, the State will collect all of it, and\nwe make one exception. We define which property the\nState will directly get the money from, and then the\ncity can do the rest, if it wants. Now, here's what we\ndo with the State money. We give it to the city. So if\nthe city wants to, it can put the same tax on that\nlittle bit of property left over, which is a subcategory\nof oil and gas property. And by the way, the name of\nthat little bit of property left over is called \"a\nship.\"\nNow, is that a tonnage tax, and is that what\nAlaska has done here?\nMR. ROTHFELD: If I understand the example,\nthat -- that might be a tonnage tax, depending upon the\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: I described to you the\nentire tax. We know no more about it.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, if -- if it's a tax on\noil and gas property, and that is the definition of the\ntax and it happens to fall on vessels as part of the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The way it does is just as\nI said. And maybe I was -- it was too much for you to\ntake in. So the point is that it's a tax on oil and gas\nproperty. That's Code section 1. Code section 2 is\ndefined subcategories -- (a), (b), (c), (d, (e), (f) --\nall of that. Code 3 says (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e).\nThe -- the State government collects and remits it to\nthe city. (G), the city can assess the same tax if it\nwishes. It doesn't have to -- and keep the money. (G)\nis ships.\nAnd the reason I have asked that question is\nI read something from a -- Alaska Department of Economic\nand Community Development which suggested to me that\nthat is Alaska's tax. I might have that wrong. I just\nread a sentence or two, and maybe I am wrong that that\nis Alaska's tax, and --\nMR. ROTHFELD: Yes, and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if it's Alaska's tax --\nMR. ROTHFELD: That's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- what's wrong with it?\nIt's a -- it's a tax on all oil and gas property, and\nall they do is they let the city collect some of that if\nthey want, and they collect the rest of it and give it\nto the city.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, what's -- what's wrong\nwith what's going on here and -- and I think this is an\nanswer to your question -- the City of Valdez has the\nauthority to tax an entire -- as I said, the entire\nuniverse of personalty. And -- and as -- as you\ndescribed it, the City of Valdez also can impose a tax,\nalthough it doesn't have to, on -- on vessels. And the\ncity has chosen to single out vessels out of all the\ntypes of property that it could tax, and it imposes a\ntax on them called a property tax.\nThe reality of it is that it's a tax on\nvessels.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I'd like to know is:\nDo you think what I said was a misdescription? What's\nworrying me about this aspect of this case is a possible\nneed to send it back to find out what Alaska's tax\nsystem is. Now -- now, if what I just said is a -- is a\ncorrect description approximately and if the other side\nthinks it is, too, then at least I -- I know how to go\nabout deciding it. And if I don't, I don't know quite\nwhat to do.\nMR. ROTHFELD: My -- my understanding of how\nthe tax system works is that this -- this is a State\nlevel tax. Alaska determines what are subject to tax,\ndetermines the items of property that are subject to\ntax. It determines which of these vessels are subject\nto -- to the Alaska tax. It then allows the City of\nValdez to collect the tax and to use the tax, but it is\na tax imposed by law by the State of Alaska.\nValdez has no discretion to tax things that\nare not oil and gas property, that are not taxed by the\n-- by -- subject to the tax at the State level by the\nState.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: As you understand it, with\nreference to the tax base referred to in the red brief\nat page 14 where it says it's 11 percent of the tax\nbase, is that tax base all city-imposed?\nMR. ROTHFELD: No. My -- my understanding\nof what they are referring to is that this is -- Alaska\ntax oil and gas property, including the Alaska oil\npipeline and the oil terminal in the City of Valdez,\nwhich are enormously valuable pieces of property. So I\nthink that -- that we are sort of talking apples and\noranges here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was your answer to the\nChief Justice that if there is a tonnage tax imposed on\neverything including -- including ships, it would still\nviolate the Tonnage Clause. Is that right?\nMR. ROTHFELD: If it's a -- a literal duty\nimposed on the -- the cubic capacity of the ship, it --\nit's difficult to see how that could really be imposed\nin terms -- on every other item of property. I suppose\nif the -- if the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's my -- it's my\nhypothetical. I made it up.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, if the city were --\nwere to say that every transportation -- device of\ntransportation was going to be -- be taxed on the basis\nof its cubic capacity, you know, vans and railroads --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think it would be\nokay?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I think that would be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's only discrimination\nthat counts?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, we focus on -- well,\nno. I would say -- I would not say it's necessarily\nokay. That would be a different kind of situation than\nwe have here. Here we have the purest case of what's --\nof -- of a tax which is focused exclusively on vessels.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there's some --\nthere's some fight about that, obviously. There --\nthere is no fight about the fact that this tax is based\nupon how long the ship remains in port, right?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How many days.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. How many days it\nremains in port.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, there are two of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which means, the argument\ncould go that this is obviously a -- a tax for the use\nof the port. And that's exactly what the Tonnage Clause\nwas directed against, preventing Philadelphia and New\nYork from taxing the consumers in New Jersey by imposing\ntaxes on ships that bring in goods.\nMR. ROTHFELD: I -- I agree entirely with\nthat. The -- the effect of this tax is to tax\nessentially the charge for trading in the Port of\nValdez, and that is exactly what the Framers --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you don't dispute\nthat in light of the benefits provided by Valdez to the\nshipowners, that they could be a legitimate tax on these\nvessels?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That is -- that is absolutely\nright. There -- there --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So could you describe\nwhat tax authority you think Valdez has?\nMR. ROTHFELD: There are two ways that\nValdez could go about taxing these vessels. It could\nimpose a user fee, and the Court has recognized in its\nTonnage Clause decisions that even a -- a tax on cubic\ncapacity, a tax on weight, would be fine if that is a\nuser fee which is designed to provide -- pay for\nservices that are provided specifically to vessels\nroughly equivalent to the value of the services\nprovided. So that is one way Valdez could do it.\nA second way they could do it is to impose a\nnondiscriminatory property tax. If they imposed a tax\non the citizenry of Valdez affecting some broad array of\npersonal property, that would impose the kind of\npolitical constraints that would discourage, you know,\nabusive export of the city's tax burden, which is just\nwhat the Framers --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How much property -- you\nsaid if they -- if they taxed all moveables, that would\nbe okay. Could they have some exemptions and still --\nMR. ROTHFELD: It -- it may -- I -- I\nsuppose the test would be if it's predominantly focused\non vessels, that would be unconstitutional. This case\ndoesn't provide an opportunity to -- to explore exactly\nhow far that goes because this is, as I say, the purest\ncase of a tax, property tax, all the property tax, which\napplies only to vessels.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you don't think a daily\n-- a daily charge on vessels for remaining in port\nviolates the Tonnage Clause?\nMR. ROTHFELD: It would violate the Tonnage\nClause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is this anything else than\nthat?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I -- I agree with you,\nJustice Scalia, that however ports, States, or cities go\nabout trying to impose a tax on vessels for the -- I'm\ncalling it the privilege of trading in the port, as\ndistinct from the user fee I discussed with\nJustice Ginsburg, that would be an unconstitutional\ntonnage duty. That's what the Court has said --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What about a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was going to say,\neven if it's a flat fee?\nMR. ROTHFELD: According --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Every vessel has to\npay, you know, $1,000.\nMR. ROTHFELD: The Court has so held on\nseveral occasions that a flat fee violates the Tonnage\nClause.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Rothfeld, can I ask\nyou a question, just focusing on the Tonnage Clause, not\nthe elements of discrimination? If you assume that the\nTonnage Clause was designed to protect New Jersey from\nbeing exploited by New York and perhaps other States\nbecause they don't have their own ports, why does that\nrationale have any application to this case, because the\nonly State ships oil out of Alaska is Alaska? So there\nis no other State like New Jersey who could be harmed by\nthe Tonnage Clause.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, if the recipients of\nthe property are -- Valdez is taking it -- this is\nreally --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What State is being\ndiscriminated against in the scenario we have before us\ntoday?\nMR. ROTHFELD: All of the States that are\nusing the oil shipped through Valdez are paying --\nultimately paying this tax. I mean, this is what the\nFramers were concerned about. The -- the danger that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you are saying it's an\nunduly onerous burden on the oil companies and their\ntankers, and they only ship oil out of Alaska.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, the concern that the\nFramers had in putting the Tonnage Clause in the\nConstitution, as with the Import-Export Clause, was that\nStates with favorable port facilities were going to be\nimposing burdens by taking advantage of their favorable\ngeography to impose burdens that are going to be felt by\nthe other States. That is exactly what Valdez has done.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not felt by the other\nStates, felt by the consumers in other States.\nUltimately, it's not going to be the oil companies that\npay this tax; it's going to be purchasers of oil.\nMR. ROTHFELD: That -- that's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All of whom are going to be\noutside of Alaska, since this oil is leaving Alaska,\nright?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is exactly\nright.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a neat tax, you know,\nget somebody else to pay your taxes.\nMR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is precisely\nright, and that's just what the Framers were concerned\nwith, the Tonnage Clause in the Constitution.\nIf -- if I may, I will move to the\napportionment issue in the case. I don't want -- I\ndon't want to -- to leave behind -- the Court had\nquestioned on the Tonnage Clause.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but just on\na -- maybe this doesn't matter. I have seen the\ncapacity of cargo planes described in terms of tonnage.\nDoes this clause apply to those?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is an\ninteresting question. It -- it was written to apply to\nships simply because in the late 18th century, the only\nway of moving substantial amounts of cargo was by -- was\nby vessel. And I imagine that if the Framers had in\nmind airplanes and railroads --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is that we have\nan evolving Constitution, after all.\nMR. ROTHFELD: I will leave that one alone,\nYour Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then, do you\nknow -- it's not an entirely frivolous point. I mean,\ndo you know if States, localities where airports are\nlocated charge things that might be viewed as Tonnage\nClauses on airplanes?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I don't know a definitive\nanswer to that. Generally speaking, airplanes and other\ntypes of property are -- are subjected to property taxes\non the value, and not on capacity. Although, as I said,\nthe Framers, I don't think, cared about capacity as\nsuch. They just cared about charges that were being\nimposed upon vessels that were going to be passed\nthrough, as Justice Scalia said, to the ultimate\npurchasers or sellers of the imports and exports that\nwere -- that were in the vessel.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I thought you said earlier\nor implied earlier that we couldn't draw a distinction,\nreally, between capacity and value because tonnage in\nthe 18th century was simply a proxy for the -- for the\nvalue of the ship?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That -- that's right. And I\ndon't -- I hope I didn't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So a value tax is going to\nrun into the same problem --\nMR. ROTHFELD: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- as a tonnage tax.\nMR. ROTHFELD: That's right. And as for the\nChief Justice's question, application to moving vans or\ncargo planes, the Court did not consider that because\nthis is the purest case. It is within the plain terms\nof the Tonnage Clause, the historical application of the\nTonnage Clause. It's the clear intent of the Framers in\nwriting the Tonnage Clause.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the amount of the tax\nwere measured by the number of sailors who were going to\ncome ashore and the number of days they would be ashore,\nand a small port city wanted to recover the costs that\nthey impose on municipal services, would that be --\nwould that be subject to the same flaw that you see\nhere?\nMR. ROTHFELD: It -- it would, although it\nmight be possible for the city to impose some type of\nuser fee calibrated in that direction. The Court's\ncases refer to -- the tonnage principle applies to the\nnumber of passengers that the ship may carry or the\nnumber of crew members on the ship. If -- if it's not a\nproxy for particular expenses that are imposed on the\njurisdiction, as this concededly is not, that was not\nwhat the -- Valdez intent in passing this tax, then it\nwould be problematic under the Tonnage Clause.\nBut I say again we have here the clearest,\neasiest case under the Tonnage Clause. It's a -- it is\na tax that is designed exclusively of vessels that trade\nin the harbor.\nOn the apportionment question -- and I don't\nwant to give short shrift to that, because the Valdez\ntax is apportioned in a way that is guaranteed to impose\na tax on values that are not present in the\njurisdiction -- Polar's tankers spend only a small part\nof the year in Valdez. They spend the rest of the time\non the high seas or in other ports either unloading oil\nor in dry dock. And, therefore, everybody agrees the\ntax has to be apportioned.\nThe ordinary way and the way that this Court\nhas approved the apportionment of a tax on physical\nproperty -- physical property is straightforward. You\nwould put in the numerator of the tax the number of days\nwith the number of miles they spent in or number of\nmiles traveled in the taxing jurisdiction; you put in\nthe denominator 365, the total number of miles traveled\neverywhere. You multiply that fraction times the value\nof the property.\nAnd so, for example, if I have a\ntranscontinental passenger train moving from New York to\nCalifornia that spends 20 percent of its time in\nNew York, New York could tax 20 percent of the value of\nthe train.\nThat is not how Valdez does it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's -- the train\nis going to be some place throughout its trip, unlike\nthe ship that's going to be on the high seas.\nMR. ROTHFELD: That's right. But the -- the\nValdez theory does not depend upon the taxation, the\ntaxability of a ship somewhere else. Valdez is simply\nsaying that we are entitled to tax, you know, not on the\nbasis of physical presence in this jurisdiction at all.\nWe are entitled to tax on some concept of where\nproductive commercial activity takes place.\nAnd so it does not apportion on the basis of\namount of time spent in the jurisdiction over the course\nof the year, which is the approach that the Court\nordinarily has used. The Valdez approach is precisely\nthe equivalent of New York saying, in my\ntranscontinental train example, we are going to take\ninto account only time spent in New York and Los Angeles\nloading and unloading passengers, and we are going to\ndiscount all of the rest of the year, all the rest of\nthe time that the train has spent moving the passengers\nfrom place to place.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Who can tax for the time\non the high seas?\nMR. ROTHFELD: This Court has held in the\nCentral Railroad case that the taxing authority goes to\nthe domicile. That for time --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the domicile here is\nTexas. Is that right?\nMR. ROTHFELD: The commercial domicile is\nTexas. The corporation is incorporated in Delaware.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In either case, no ships\nberth in either Delaware or Texas. Is that right?\nMR. ROTHFELD: These ships do not -- the\nships berth in Texas. The ship do not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So the home port might\nhave had in the old days the notion that's really where\nthe vessel is berthed. But, nowadays, Delaware has very\nlittle to do with where the vessels are berthing and\nwhere they are being serviced?\nMR. ROTHFELD: If I may, Your Honor, I'll --\nI'll answer that question and sit down to reserve a\nlittle bit of time. You are right as to the physical\nlocation of the ship, but the -- the jurisdiction, the\nauthority of a non-domicile to tax has always been\nconstrained by -- under the Due Process Clause -- by the\nphysical location of the property.\nAnd so, the fact that the property may or\nmay not be subject to tax somewhere else does not give\nValdez additional authority to tax property that's not\npresent there.\nNow, the Court has said that the domicile,\nwhether or not the property is present, is providing\nbenefits to the owner of the property, and it's those\nbenefits that justify the imposition of the tax for\nperiods when it is not in any tax situs subject to tax\nby anybody else.\nAnd if I may, Your Honor, I will reserve.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Olson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn the Wheeling case, this Court said it is\ntoo well settled to question the taxes upon vessels\nbased upon their value as property do not violate the\nTonnage Clause. In fact, no ad valorem property tax has\never been held to violate the Tonnage Clause.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it says \"vessels of\nall kinds are liable to taxation as property in the same\nmanner as other personal property.\"\nMR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Kennedy, precisely\nin the same manner as other ad valorem property taxes.\nNow let me answer the question that both you and Justice\nBreyer particularly addressed, which was the oil and --\nand gas tax imposed with respect to much of the property\nin Valdez. Valdez taxes homes, it taxes oil and gas\nproperty, it taxes barges, it taxes cruises, it taxes\nall sorts of things just like every other jurisdiction\ndoes. The oil and gas tax that you ask about,\nJustice Kennedy, and you did, too, Justice Breyer, is\nimposed -- and there is no need to remand this case to\naddress this. It's in Section 43.56 of the Alaska Code.\nThe State of Alaska imposes an oil and gas tax on\nproperty used in the oil and gas extraction,\ntransportation, et cetera, business, but it also\nauthorizes a city under Section 43.56 and 29.45 -- the\nCity of Valdez may impose that tax as well. It's two\nmils, it's just like every other tax that is imposed in\nValdez. These are taxes imposed on the same basis. If\nthe city imposes the tax, which the City of Valdez does,\nthen the tax by the State -- that tax paid to Valdez is\na direct credit, dollar for dollar credit, for the tax\nthat would otherwise have to go to the State.\nSo, in the first place, I think would it\nmake no difference as suggested by your question,\nJustice Breyer, whether it was the State or the city\nthat imposed the tax. The constitutional provision\nrefers to states. States divide up their taxing\nauthorities in various different ways. The fact is that\nthe State of Alaska through the City of Valdez imposes a\ntax on lots of different things.\nThis oil and gas tax that we are talking\nabout consists of 60 to 70 percent of the revenue base\nof taxation for the City of Valdez. The -- the ship\ntax, the tax on the -- that actually applies to vessels\nwhich include the tankers, include barges, include a\ncruise ship, includes just Alaska ships and -- and\nships --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not fishing ships, right?\nMR. OLSON: The fishing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: None of -- none of Valdez's\nfishermen have to pay this tax at all?\nMR. OLSON: They don't have to pay this tax,\nJustice Scalia, but they pay other taxes. There is tax\non -- on the weight of fish and there is tax on the\nvalue of fish and there's tax -- there's -- fees, they\nuse a different dock and they pay taxes there, to.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But your answer it seems\nto me does put the issue squarely before us in the terms\nthat the Petitioner has presented, that is to say, sure,\nsuppose you tax the vessel and you tax trailers and\nsmall vessels and a lot of other things, but as to all\nof the latter category, you have -- you have an\nexemption. So the -- the only people that effectively\npay the tax are the tankers.\nMR. OLSON: No.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I thought that that\nwas the way the case was presented.\nMR. OLSON: No. Well, that is not correct,\nif I understood your -- your statement correctly. This\noil and gas property, cranes, heavy equipment, fire\nengines, motor vehicles, everything else, including the\npeople's home in Valdez get taxed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the people's homes\nonly if they are affixed to the property and they --\nMR. OLSON: No, that's with respect to\nmobile homes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: They are taxed as real property\nwhen they are affixed in that way.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And nonmobile homes are not\ntaxed as real property?\nMR. OLSON: The tax -- cities may impose\ntaxes as real property or -- or personal property,\nJustice Scalia. Some states will tax mobile homes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, the question is what\nis imposed here? My understanding from the yellow\nbook -- do you agree the yellow brief is accurate in its\nfactual descriptions, perhaps not in its conclusions\nthat it draws?\nMR. OLSON: No, Justice Kennedy. I have --\nI've given you --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: See, we have a problem\nwith the facts here. But my understanding of the case,\nand please correct me if I am wrong, is that sure,\nValdez has tax authority and tax statutes which would\ncover a considerable amount of personal property on an\nad valorem basis. But because of exemptions, only the\ntankers pay this tax.\nMR. OLSON: The -- there are various taxes\nimposed by Valdez on personal property and real\nproperty.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was my statement correct?\nMR. OLSON: Your statement is correct only\nwith respect to the ordinance that -- that eliminated\nthe exception. These big ships that impose enormous\nburdens on the municipality, you can only imagine what\nthree, four hundred --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's a different\nargument. Can we just get to --\nMR. OLSON: Yes, I know. But these ships\nwere exempt from taxation in Valdez until the year 1999\nwhen that ordinance that you are referring to,\nJustice Kennedy, was adopted. It eliminated --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So was all other personal\nproperty exempt from taxation, they didn't have a\npersonal property tax, right?\nMR. OLSON: Except -- except, under the --\nto the extent that that personal property was covered by\nthe oil and gas tax, the provisions that I have referred\nto, Valdez had been imposing that tax.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's nicely targeted as\nwell. But there is no constitutional impediment to\ntargeting the people of New Jersey through taxing the\noil equipment.\nMR. OLSON: If the Wheeling case is correct\nand the other cases that have repeatedly said this,\nthere is no constitutional impediment for a city or a\nstate to impose a property tax on property being\nused in --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Wheeling -- Wheeling\nwas, it was a general property tax. And as I read the\ncase, it said if you are going to tax property, you can\ninclude vessels. This statute, and I think the Alaska\nSupreme Court treated it discretely, is a tax on one\nkind of property only, these vessels. I don't know of\nany other property tax that is confined to just one type\nof property. Is there another? Is there a comparable\ntax that is focused on a single category of property?\nMR. OLSON: There -- well, I -- I think what\nmy point here with respect to this, Justice Ginsburg, is\nI don't know the answer specifically to that question,\nbut we are looking at what the bundle of taxes that a\ncommunity or a state imposes on property used that\nimposes a burden on the community. Property is taxed\nfor the purpose, so that the property owner will bear\nthe burden of the governmental services that a city has\nto impose. It -- there is no constitutional provision\nthat I am aware of that says that you have to have it\nall in one statute, collected -- and there is no\ndiscrimination --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you can't -- you can't\nmake vessels bear the overall burden of municipal\ngovernance. You can make them bear the burden of the\nservices provided to them in harbor. But you cannot\nmake them the instrument of funding all other municipal\nservices. That's what the Tonnage Clause means.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I disagree in part with\nwhat you said, with respect, Justice Scalia; these\nshelves pay 11 percent -- vessels pay 11 percent of the\nrevenue base for the city; 11 percent. This is a city\nof 4,500 people.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How do you define revenue\nbase?\nMR. OLSON: This is the amount of tax\ncollected by the City of Valdez with respect to the ad\nvalorem taxes in the city, including ships, mobile\nhomes, cranes, barges, appliances, real property, and so\nforth.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You are counting the state\ntax as well, right?\nMR. OLSON: Pardon me.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You are counting the state\ntax on oil equipment?\nMR. OLSON: I am -- I am saying to you that\nthe State imposes a tax but the State specifically\nallows valid to impose that very tax.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That makes matters worse.\nMR. OLSON: Valdez imposes that tax as a\npart of its total taxation package.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let's suppose I accept just\nwhat Justice Ginsburg said, and said it's a hopeless\nmorass if we look at all taxes. Let's look at this tax.\nThis tax you call an ad valorem tax on personal\nproperty levied by Valdez, and then on page 11 of your\nbrief you say that's not just on ships, it's also on\nmobile homes, trailers, recreational vehicles, and\nvarious types of personal property defined under State\nlaw as oil and gas property, motor vehicle, machinery,\nsupplies and maintenance equipment.\nThey come back and they say, as to your\nmobile homes, trailers and recreational vehicles, all\nthat's happening there is either you have exempted them\nor they are fixed in place, and they are like real\nproperty and that's what you are doing. As to the other\nthings, you do not impose a tax on those other things.\nRather, the State imposes a tax on those other things.\nAnd it may be that you help the State do it by providing\nthem with the assessment, and it may be even that you\ncould do it, but you haven't; and therefore, the only\nthing you have imposed this tax on are the ships.\nNow I think I have that argument right. If\nI do, what's the answer to it?\nMR. OLSON: The answer is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If I don't, what's the\nright argument?\nMR. OLSON: The answer is Section 43.56 that\nallows -- the State statute may impose that tax you just\ndescribed. And it -- and section 29.\nJUSTICE BREYER: May impose doesn't help if\nyou don't do it.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, it does impose it, and\nthen, Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: State imposes it or --\nMR. OLSON: -- section 29.45.080 says -- I am\ngoing to read it exactly; this seems to be an important\npoint. It doesn't seem to me that it ought to make any\ndifference from the Tonnage Clause standpoint whether\nit's a tax imposed by the State or a subdivision of the\nState, but this provision specifically says a\nmunicipality may levy and collect taxes on taxable\nproperty, taxable under AS 43. That's the one. The\nState does impose this tax but it also allows the city\nto impose it.\nThis city does impose it. And when it is\npaid, that is a credit against what might otherwise be\nowed to the State. So the city does impose that tax, it\ndoes collect that tax, and that tax is not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait a minute, owed to the\nState for what? What would be owed to the state? It's\nstill a State tax and they are the collection agent, and\nit's a -- a credit against what they owe for their\ncollections, right?\nMR. OLSON: A municipality may levy and\ncollect taxes on property under this section. The city\nlevies and collects those taxes. Now --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what's it a credit\nagainst? I don't understand what it's a credit against.\nMR. OLSON: The State also imposes the\nliability. Any individual community in Alaska may\nimpose that tax itself. If it does -- Valdez does --\nthen you don't have to pay it to the State, you pay it\nto the city. So it's a city tax. Now --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does the city get a\ncredit against?\nMR. OLSON: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- as referred to in the --\nMR. OLSON: The taxpayer, once he pays $10\nto the city under this tax, doesn't have to pay $10 to\nthe State under this tax because he gets a credit for --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I thought it was the\ncity that got the credit --\nMR. OLSON: No, it is the taxpayer that gets\nthe credit. The city levies the tax. The city collects\nthe tax. And then the taxpayer doesn't have to pay the\nState.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that happens with all\nthese other properties? That is, in Valdez, you pay the\ncity -- you pay the city -- for the -- for the taxes on\nthat oil and gas property that isn't shipped?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, Justice Breyer. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you write the check to\nthe city.\nMR. OLSON: What? Pardon?\nJUSTICE BREYER: All the things you listed\non page 11 --\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The -- the oil and gas,\nmotor vehicles, machinery, appliances, supplies, and\nmaintenance equipment.\nMR. OLSON: Those are money paid to the\ncity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So they write a check to\nthe city. Okay.\nMR. OLSON: Yes. Now, it shouldn't matter.\nThe Tonnage Clause prohibits States from imposing a\ntonnage tax.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that's exactly the\nquestion I wanted to ask you. Supposing the city did\nnot impose any taxes on anybody except the people who\npay this tax, and that's all. Would it -- would it be\nconstitutional or unconstitutional?\nMR. OLSON: No, it would not be. In the\nfirst place --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It would not be\nconstitutional?\nMR. OLSON: It would not be -- it would not\nbe unconstitutional, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, but then why is the --\nwhat other people pay on other taxes even relevant?\nMR. OLSON: I don't think it is relevant.\nThe nondiscrimination issue has been introduced by the\nPetitioner in this case. It is not in the Tonnage\nClause. It is not in any of the cases decided by this\nCourt having to do with the Tonnage Clause, having to do\nwith wharfage fees, pilotage fees, other things having\nto do with commercial activity in a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So we can take as a -- as\na given for the purpose of analyzing the issue, that\nthis tax is either the only tax that's relevant to our\nanalysis or that it's so much higher than all the other\ntaxes, it should be treated as the functional equivalent\nas the only tax we have to look at?\nMR. OLSON: I'm saying that it would not\nmake any difference if this was the only tax that the\ncity imposed unless it was a tonnage tax, and the\ntonnage tax -- this Court has repeatedly --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the answer to\nJustice Stevens's question is we can take this case as\npresenting to us the fact that the ships pay more than\nother property?\nMR. OLSON: No.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you say that doesn't\nmake any difference.\nMR. OLSON: No, the ships do not pay more.\nI don't think it would make any difference if -- if the\ncity decided to impose a different rate of tax on motor\nvehicles than it did on homes or -- or vessels, as long\nas it was an ad valorem property tax, and this one is.\nThe vessels are not based -- the tax is\nassessed every year on the replacement value of the\nvessels. A big ship that is worth less money because it\nwould cost less to replace it, because it doesn't have a\ndouble hull or a double bottom, will be taxed -- it will\nbe taxed greater in proportion to its value. The value\nimposed is assessed every year.\nThere's no challenge here -- it's very\nimportant to understand that there is no challenge by\nthe Petitioners with respect to the valuations placed on\nthese ships. There's no contention that the value\nplaced upon these ships by this ad valorem property tax\nis based upon cubic capacity. They have --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But is it -- do you -- do\nyou contest the point that was made in the reply brief\nthat back at the end of the 18th century, tonnage was\nconsidered a proxy for value, that it was the customary\nmode of measuring the value of a ship?\nMR. OLSON: I do contest that,\nJustice Ginsburg. The only citation for that is Justice\nMiller. Justice Miller is cited for that in a lecture\nthat he gave after he left the Court. He was on the\ncourt from 1862 to 1890. He joined the Court in the --\nin the Inman case, the Wheeling case, the Parkersburg\ncase, and here's the quote from the Inman -- from the\nClyde Mallory case in 1935, which is quoting the Inman\ncase from during that period of time. \"At the time the\nConstitution was adopted, 'tonnage' was a\nwell-understood commercial term signifying the internal\ncapacity of the vessel.\" This Court has said that over\nand over again. In the Wheeling case, when it said --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is -- for a\ncommercial vessel, is a rough calculation of how much\nit's worth.\nMR. OLSON: It is not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The more cargo you can\ncarry, the more valuable the commercial ship.\nMR. OLSON: That is not correct,\nJustice Scalia, and it's -- and it's not correct in this\ncase. Experts put an assessment on these ships based\nupon their replacement value. It may have -- one factor\nmay be how -- how the ship is constructed, whether it\nhas a double hull. These have to be Jones Act-compliant\nships. The newer ones are more valuable. If they move\nfaster, they're more valuable. If they're more\nefficient, they have more value. One of these ships in\nthis case is valued 10 times more as -- higher value --\nthan a ship that carries more capacity because it's\nnewer.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But all you're saying --\nMR. OLSON: And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All you're saying is that\nthere are other factors that -- that preclude using\ntonnage simply as a single crude measure. But isn't it\nfair to say that, other things being equal -- the engine\ncapacity, the hull construction, et cetera -- the\ntonnage is a rough measurement of the value of the ship,\nfor just the reason that Justice Scalia gave? It\ndetermines the amount of cargo the ship can carry, and\nwhat it can charge for it, and that is capitalized into\nthe value of the ship. Isn't that true?\nMR. OLSON: Well, if -- if everything else\nwas equal, the bigger, the more capacity, the more\nvaluable the vessel might be, that's true. But that --\nthat is not the case. Different ships are different\nsizes. They are made out of different materials. They\nhave different structural capabilities --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So as long as you are\ntaxing on the basis of the value of the ship, then you\nhave no Tonnage Clause problem. Is that your -- the\nTonnage Clause was a specific type of measure, and if\nyou're taxing based on the assessed value of the\nproperty, it isn't a Tonnage Clause. Is that your --\nMR. OLSON: That is what this Court has\nsaid. In the Wheeling case, where we were talking about\nsteamships, the Court said that same statement that you\njust made about an ad valorem tax property tax 10 times.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about a porthole tax?\nMR. OLSON: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is a porthole tax in your\nview okay?\nMR. OLSON: A what?\nJUSTICE BREYER: A porthole tax. They\ncharge for portholes. Anyone who has a porthole who\ncomes into our city pays taxed. That's not a tonnage\ntax.\nMR. OLSON: That's not a tonnage tax.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, in your view, a masked\ntax.\nMR. OLSON: To the extent that the tax is on\na vessel as an instrument of commercial conveyance, what\nthis Court has said --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, but the porthole tax\napplies, by the way, to that ship's captain who has\nretired, who has built his house with portholes instead\nof windows.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: I have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So there are 2 or 3 percent\nof the -- I mean, it's only 99.9 percent on ships.\nMR. OLSON: Let's start on the basics.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: When the Constitution was\nwritten, the Constitution did not intend to take away\nthe power from the States to impose taxes. The\nprovision on the import-export prohibition on the States\nand Tonnage Clause was an instrument to protect\ncommerce. It wasn't an instrument to reduce the power\nof States to impose taxes. The baseline is States have\nthe power to impose taxes unless there's an explicit --\nand the court has said narrow -- limitation on that tax\npower in the Constitution.\nNow, what this Court has said over and over\nagain, Justice Breyer -- it hasn't had a chance to deal\nwith portholes -- but it has had a chance to deal with\nmost of these various earlier cases in the -- in the\n1860s and '70s had to do with tax on tonnage. And there\nwas one case where New Orleans levied a tax just for the\nentry and departure of the ship, and the Court said,\nwell, that's -- that's a tax on the ship as a -- as a\ncommercial instrument of commerce, and that would be\ncovered also. But nothing else has been covered.\nAnd the Court has gone out of its way to say\nthat communities, States, are entitled to tax people\nthat possess property within their jurisdiction because\nof --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if you --\nif you are right that any type of ad valorem tax is\nokay, well, then why in the world would the Framers have\nadopted a prohibition on a tonnage tax, if you could\njust say it's a tax on value, which is going to have the\nsame impact on commerce?\nMR. OLSON: Because -- because, if you are\ntaxing -- I think that the Court had reasons for the\nconclusion it came to. What I'm saying is not what I've\ninvented; it's what the Court has said repeatedly, that\nbecause property may be taxed as property because the\nusers and owners of property are the source of revenue\nfor the communities --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, putting aside\nwhat the Court has said, I'm looking at what the Framers\nhave said. What good does a tonnage tax prohibition do\n--\nMR. OLSON: It does --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- if you are right?\nMR. OLSON: It -- if it's -- if it's a State\nusing a tax on a vessel qua vessel as an instrument to\nlimit commerce, that is something that the Framers did\nnot want to do. They -- they prohibited taxes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It offended them\naesthetically?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: No, because -- for --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So all the State has to say\nis we are not -- we're not taxing you qua vessel.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: No, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, what --\nMR. OLSON: What the Framers were concerned\nabout and what I was trying to say in response to the\nChief Justice's question is that there was a limitation\non the states' power to tax imports or exports because\nof the fact that that would put the states on the coast\nat an advantage and they would pass those burdens on to\nthe inland states. The Tonnage Clause was put there as\na specific provision to implement and -- to prevent the\ncircumvention of the export/import prohibition.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Olson --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But I suppose you could --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- let me ask you something\nabout -- about discrimination. Let's assume that I\nthink it is relevant whether the tax is a discriminatory\ntax, property tax just levied on -- on ships or not.\nIf that is my position, why should I count\nas establishing nondiscrimination the fact that Alaska\nor Valdez is also taxing -- most of its other property\ntax revenue comes from taxing oil equipment, right? And\nthe burden of all of that tax, just like the burden of\nthis vessel tax, is paid by people in New Jersey. I\nmean, you know, that --\nMR. OLSON: You can --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's getting somebody else\nto bear the burden of your taxation.\nMR. OLSON: If do it would be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Taxing that equipment\nraises the price of oil, almost all of which the oil\ngoes out of Alaska and is paid for by people in other\nstates. Why should I count that property tax as proving\nthat either the State of Alaska or Valdez is not being\ndiscriminatory? Just because it -- it can't possibly\nviolate the -- the Tonnage Clause doesn't mean that it\nisn't as much discriminatory against other states.\nMR. OLSON: That then might -- that might be\na Due Process Clause problem --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I --\nMR. OLSON: But it wouldn't be a Tonnage\nClause problem. I would submit, Justice Scalia, you\nwould be very upset at the -- at Silicon Valley because\nthe property tax imposed on Silicon Valley gets all put\non those chips that we used in all of these computers,\nand everybody else in the country is using those\ncomputers, so the property that is taxed in that\ncommunity is the property that creates the value of that\ncommunity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if -- if California\ntaxed vessels, I would not allow California to come in\nand say, oh, we are just subjecting them to the same tax\nthat our own citizens are subjected to.\nMR. OLSON: And Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't let them point\nto the Silicon Valley tax.\nMR. OLSON: You would -- you would, I\nsubmit, then, say that vessels are exempt from property\ntax.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That may be the only way\nthey can accomplish what they want to. Because as the\nChief Justice's question suggested a moment ago, if in\nthe 18th century the port of Boston said, \"We are not\ngoing to charge tonnage anymore. We are simply going to\ntax on the value of the ship,\" that is going to have\nexactly the same effect that a tonnage tax would have.\nSo maybe exemption is the only way it can be done.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it's going to require an\namendment to the Constitution because what the Framers\ntalked about was a Tonnage Clause, and they were talking\nabout --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we have said --\nMR. OLSON: -- and they did not exempt --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, we -- we have\nsaid it's not just tonnage. It said that the clause\nbars states, we said, from imposing a charge even if not\nmeasured by a vessel's tonnage, for the privilege of\nentering, trading in or lying in a port. So we have\nruled out the position that it's got to be an\nold-fashioned tonnage charge, and can't be based on the\nassessed value of the property.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I guess I have to resort\nto the fact that every time this Court has considered\nit, or at least in almost every case, the Court has gone\nout of its way to say, they were not intending to\nprohibit states from taxing the value of property, if\nit's an ad valorem tax.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but in all of\nthose cases the vessels were being taxed as one item of\nproperty in a general moveable property, personal\nproperty tax. I asked you before, I think, is there any\nother tax like this, that -- an ad valorem tax that is\napplied to one single category of property?\nMR. OLSON: If this -- this is an ad valorem\ntax, it has various different statutes and ordinances\nthat it comes from, but there's ad valorem taxes in\nValdez across the board for all kinds of property.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This statute deals with\none category of property. Is there another statute like\nthis one?\nMR. OLSON: Well, there -- no. This\nstatute is -- every other statute in the same manner\nimposes taxes on property based upon their value. This\nwas a separate ordinance that decided to remove an\nexemption that had existed for 27 years --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the other, the\nState taxes were no part of the Alaska Supreme Court's\ndecision in this case.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I think what we are\ntalking about is whether or not this community can\nimpose a tax on the people that own property in this\ncommunity. There's no denial that there is a property\ntax situs here. The average length of the time in port\nof these ships was 45 days. The entire fleet has a tax\nsitus in Valdez. So this property, like other property\nin the same manner, is being taxed by the City of\nValdez.\nThe Wheeling case was a case a little bit\nlike this in the sense that it was West Virginia that\npassed a statute that allowed Wheeling to impose the tax\non steam ships.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And on what else? In\nthat -- in that tax that was before the port. What else\ndid Wheeling tax?\nMR. OLSON: The only thing that the Court\ntalked about because it was -- like this it was an\nas-applied case, the taxpayer was wanting a refund from\nthe taxes and the taxpayer owned steam ships that --\nthat went back and forth from Wheeling. And the Court\ntalked about the fact that this wasn't a Tonnage Clause,\nthis was a state-authorized municipal -\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about the Greer? You\nhaven't mentioned that. Greer in Norris v. City of\nBoston. Where he says the -- you know what it says;\nit's on the front page of their brief. All right. That\nseemed to me to say, don't interpret the Tonnage Clause\nto apply to tonnage. Interpret it, same thing as if it\nwas mass, it's mariners, power of the steam engine,\nnumber of passengers, the master or owner of the\nvessel -- all those fall within the Tonnage Clause.\nThat's what the paragraph seems to say.\nMR. OLSON: And what -- what the thrust of\nthe overall bulk of the cases including the language by\nthis Court repeatedly is that property taxation based\nupon the value of property, not imposing a value -- not\nimposing a tax on the ship. There are various ways I\nsuppose one could say that every time a ship enters a\nharbor without developing a tax situs -- I think Justice\nAlito's question focused on that -- this is not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a --\nMR. OLSON: You don't get charged a fee for\nentering the port. Or one of those cases when --\nimposes a tax because -- it called it a wharfage tax,\nbut you didn't have to touch the wharf to pay the tax.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a\nquestion that I don't' think has come up, but I just\nwondered if anybody has argued this. The duty of\ntonnage, it seems to me, might refer to the cargo rather\nthan the ship. So if the ship made ten voyages it might\nhave ten times the tonnage of another vessel of exactly\nthe same value. Has anybody argued that that's what the\nTonnage Clause refers to?\nMR. OLSON: I think -- I think you're\ncorrect, Justice Stevens, that what the Framers were\nconcerned about was a substitute for -- export or import\ntax by taxing what was in the ship, and that tonnage\nreferred to that, but it wasn't the value of the vessel\nitself because the Court -- the Framers wouldn't have\nwanted to take away the power of the states to tax\ncommercial activity using property in their communities\nin the same manner that they taxed other property.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If that's all it applied\nto, then the wharfage tax would have been perfectly\nokay. You can't say that was --\nMR. OLSON: The wharfage tax -- the wharfage\ntax has been upheld by this Court frequently. The only\nreason why it was struck down in that case is that you\ndidn't have to put into the wharf. So the Court knew it\nwasn't really a wharfage tax, but if it was really a\nwharfage tax, the Court has upheld it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Rothfeld, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Your Honor. A\ncouple of quick points. First on this confusing\nquestion of what the State of Alaska does in the nature\nof its tax. Mr. Olson began by -- by saying the State\nof Alaska imposes this tax through the City of Valdez.\nThat is right. It is a tax imposed by the State of\nAlaska that is collected by the City of Valdez. If the\ncity did not collect the tax, it would go directly to\nthe State of Alaska. It is an Alaska tax.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where does\nthe money go? If the City of Valdez collects it, where\ndoes it go?\nMR. ROTHFELD: If the city collects it, it\nkeeps it, but it has been authorized to do that by the\nState.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then I think\nwe ought to regard it as a city tax, not a State tax.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Uh --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They collect it;\nthey keep it; that sounds like a city tax.\nMR. ROTHFELD: But it -- it is imposed by\nthe State. The State decides decide what subject it\nhas. It identifies the property that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose the\nState can regulate what cities and municipalities and\ncounties can do throughout the State. That doesn't make\neverything those cities and counties do the actions of\nthe State.\nMR. ROTHFELD: That -- that's true, but this\nparticular tax is a tax that is imposed by the State at\nthe State level. It -- it's notable that Valdez has\nnever before, until we reached this Court, said that\nthis is a -- that it is taxing oil and gas property.\nThe property is subject to tax by the State. The State\nauthorizes Valdez to collect the tax, but it is imposed\nby the tax -- the city -- the State determines which\nitems are subject to tax. So this is out of Valdez's\ndiscretion. Valdez chose to tax only particular types\nof personal property, and that is vessels.\nSecond, on the question of what the Tonnage\nClause was designed to do and -- and the Wheeling case,\nWheeling says that a property tax is okay when the tax\nis imposed on vessels the same as other property owned\nby its citizens. That is not what is going on here.\nContemporaneous understanding of the rule at the time\nwas that taxes that singled out vessels were\nunconstitutional. We cite authority for this\nproposition in our reply brief.\nTo -- to address Justice Ginsburg's question\nas to whether there were other taxes like this, we have\nnot found any other tax anywhere that has been imposed\nsingling out vessels as -- for -- for property taxation.\nEither now or in the past, we have not found any case\naddressing that, not only not in this Court, but in any\nother court.\nAnd then finally --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What about the -- the\nbroader tax situation at the -- at the -- in -- in 1789?\nDid -- did ports have sources of -- or exercise the\nauthority at that time to tax property generally, e.g.,\nreal estate in the city to support the activities of the\nports, or were they dependent solely upon things like\nimport-export taxes, et cetera?\nMR. ROTHFELD: My -- my understanding is\nthat real estate certainly was subject to tax and that\nports would have the authority to tax other types of\nproperty. Vessels were set aside as a particular item\nby the Tonnage Clause.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so that the argument\nthey are taxing other things, therefore it's okay to tax\nthis, would have been an argument just as potent in the\n18th century or impotent, as the case may be, as it is\nnow?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. ROTHFELD: And so setting aside vessels\nin a -- in a unique category when other things could be\ntaxed would have been problematic --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How -- under your\nview, how is a city supposed to impose a property tax on\na vessel?\nMR. ROTHFELD: It -- it should impose a tax\nby imposing a tax on personal property generally. And\nif it does, it would fall on vessels as items of\npersonal property. It -- it is significant -- well, if\nI may, Your Honor, just to finish, what Valdez has -- it\ncould have taxed all of that types of -- or it could\nhave taxed particular types of it. But it has seized on\nonly one particular type of personal property to be\nsubject to taxation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so you think\nwe should resolve the tax by seeing how generally\napplicable property taxes are in Valdez?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I -- I think it's an easy\ncase when, as in this situation, there is only one item\nof property that is taxed, and that's a vessel.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but your --\nyour brother suggests that other items of property are\ntaxed under other provisions of the tax ordinance.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Again, Valdez does not. The\nState does. Valdez does not. And so I think that there\nis no need for the Court to go beyond and decide how\nbroadly applicable -- as I suggested earlier, our test\nwould be predominantly on vessels it is\nunconstitutional, and that clearly is the case here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
