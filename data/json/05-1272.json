        "content": "(11:09 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument next in 05-1272, Rockwell International\nCorporation versus United States.\nMs. Mahoney.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMS. MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Tenth Circuit in this case correctly\nheld that Stone could not share in the award given by\nthe jury unless he was an original source of pondcrete\nallegations. But it then went on to find that he was an\noriginal source based upon a misinterpretation of the\ncore requirements of the statutory definition.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Mahoney, let me ask you\na question. Am I wrong about this? It seems to me that\nif he was not an original source, not only shouldn't he\nget any money, but neither should the government. Isn't\nthat the way the statute reads?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, that is one\npossible interpretation of the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How is there any other\npossible one? It says there's no jurisdiction in this\nsituation.\nMS. MAHONEY: I think the way that the\ncourts have handled it below is that it says that\nthere's no jurisdiction unless it is a claim brought by\na relator who is an original source or if it's brought\nby the United States. And if the relator drops out, I\nthink courts deem it to at that point be viewed as a\nclaim brought by the United States. It's sort of a\nretroactive amendment of the pleadings.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not brought by the\nUnited States as long as he's still there.\nMS. MAHONEY: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's your argument.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, it can't be, Your Honor,\nbecause under the statutory terms, under section 3720(a)\nthe Attorney General has the authority to bring a claim\non behalf of the United States. There is no authority\nfor the United States to bring a claim on behalf of the\nrelator. Instead there is a second type of claim under\nsection 3730, and that's a section (b), which authorizes\na relator to bring a claim on behalf of himself and the\nUnited States.\nSimilarly, Your Honor, if you look at the\nprovisions in section (d), which authorize an award to a\nrelator, it requires that the action be one brought\nunder section (b), that is in other words it be an\naction brought by the relator which the United States\nthen proceeds on for (d)(1).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess it really depends\non whether you think the language \"if the Government\nproceeds with an action\" is equivalent to the\nGovernment's bringing the action.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, I don't think it can be,\nYour Honor, because if you look at the language\nthroughout these sections, it differentiates between two\nkinds of actions, actions brought by the United States\nor the Attorney General and actions brought by the\nrelator. And it is only an action brought by the\nrelator under section (b) that authorizes an award under\nsection (d). And it consistently talks about that.\nWhat they're really arguing, Your Honor, is\nthat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. It says under\n3, what is it, (c)(3) I guess, if the elects not to\nproceed with the action, the person who initiated the\naction shall have the right to conduct the action. Now,\nthat suggests that if the Government intervenes the\nGovernment is proceeding with the action, right?\nMS. MAHONEY: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you say that's\ndifferent from the Government bringing the action.\nMS. MAHONEY: Absolutely. If you look at,\nif you look at the language in section (d), for\ninstance, it says if the government proceeds with an\naction brought by a person under section, subsection\n(b). In other words, it has to be an action under\nsubsection (b) in order to authorize an award at all.\nThe Government has -- has authority under subsection (a)\nto bring an action, but it has no authority to bring it\non behalf of the relator.\nThe statute consistently uses these same\nterms, and this Court in Graham County, which was a\ndecision dealing with the statute of limitations,\nactually described this section in the same way, saying\nthat there are two kinds of actions, those that are\nbrought by the Attorney General under subsection (a) and\nthose that are brought by a relator under subsection\n(b), which the United States can then proceed with.\nWhat the relator is really arguing here is\nthat if you look at the -- at subsection (e)(4), they're\nadding a phrase that's not there. They're saying that\nthere's no jurisdiction over an action under this\nsection if it is brought by the Attorney General or\nbrought by a relator who is an original source or the\nUnited States intervenes and proceeds with the action.\nAnd that's not in here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're being very\npicky-picky with this text, considering that you're\nwilling to swallow whole the notion that so long as\nthe -- so long as the original party, so long as the\nnon-government plaintiff drops out, all of a sudden it\nbecome as action brought by the United States. That's a\nvery, very expansive notion of what \"brought by the\nUnited States\" means.\nWhat I'm saying is or, to put it another\nway, if you take your picky-picky notion of being\nbrought by the United States, to be logical about it you\nmust reach the conclusion that if you defeat the private\nplaintiff under -- under he's not original source, the\nwhole thing is thrown out, not just his recovery but the\nGovernment's recovery.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, of course that\nwould be great for Rockwell, and so --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I know, but it would be so\nextreme that we're not likely to buy it.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, we don't argue for that\nbecause I think that the Court has said that the\nGovernment's intervention does not cure defects with\nrespect to the relator, and therefore, if the relator\ndidn't have -- that -- doesn't have standing -- you\nknow, part of this goes to the issue of the Stevens\nassignment. If they don't have an assignment, then they\ndon't even have standing to be in the action, they have\nno right to recover.\nAnd so if you're correct that it can't be\ncured, in effect, through a procedure like, say, 28\nU.S.C. section 1553, which allows amendments to\ndefective jurisdictional allegations where I think that,\nwhile the courts don't technically require it, they\ncould say that really this, while it was pled as a\nsection (b) action, when the relator drops out we could\ntreat it as a section (a) action, because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Otherwise, the Attorney\nGeneral could just bring it all over again, a fresh\ncomplaint, and that would be wasted motion?\nMS. MAHONEY: That's correct, Your Honor. I\nthink it is a pragmatic rule. But again, if the rule is\nthat they lose as well, then so be it. The fact is this\nstatute uses the term that is used in section (a), which\nis \"brought by the United States.\" And it makes perfect\nsense because otherwise think of what the consequences\nare if the relator can simply copy an indictment, file a\ncomplaint, and say -- and the Government intervenes\nbecause it's a major action, and then they say, aha,\nyou're stuck with me because you've intervened and now\nthere's jurisdiction and there's no problem, I don't\nhave to be an original source.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They don't have to give\nthem any money, though. The court doesn't have to.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think that you\ncould say that they don't have to give them money.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you'd then have to pay\nhis attorneys' fees. That's what really this is about,\nisn't it?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, it is about that, but we\ndon't have to pay his attorneys' fees, Your Honor, if he\ndoesn't get a share, because the way that section (d) is\nwritten is it says that a relator who is paid a share of\nthe proceeds shall also be entitled to attorneys' fees.\nSo this is not just an issue between the United States\nand Stone. The statute controls the award of fees based\nupon whether he's entitled to a share. So even if this\nweren't an issue of jurisdiction, if he's not entitled\nto a share under a section (d)(1), then he's also not\nentitled to attorneys' fees. And therefore, we would\nwin. He would still need to -- whether it's a\njurisdictional rule or a substantive rule, if he's not\nan original source he's out.\nBut the share is not the only issue that\nmakes the Government's -- or that makes Stone's argument\nimplausible here. That is that once the relator is in\nthe action, the United States can't get them out of the\naction. Even if they don't have to pay them money,\nunder subsection (c) they have a whole range of rights\nto participate in the action. They can't dismiss the\nrelator. So it makes no sense to read this statute to\nsay that someone who copies an indictment, files a\ncomplaint, the Government intervenes, they're in there\nforever. It instead makes much more sense to read the\nterms the way they're used elsewhere in the statute, to\nmean that there is only jurisdiction if it is a section\n(a) claim brought by the United States on behalf of\nitself or if it is a section b) claim by a relator that\nis an original source. That's what makes sense of the\nstatute as a whole.\nIf I could turn to the issue of whether or\nnot the Tenth Circuit correctly held that Stone had\ndirect and independent knowledge of the information on\nwhich his allegations were based. It bears emphasis\nthat every act that he had to prove in order to recover\non the pondcrete allegations -- whether they're measured\nat the beginning of the case or the end of the case\ndoesn't matter -- every single act occurred after he\nleft the plaintiff, after he had left his job. And we\ncan see that from the outset of the case. If you look\nat his Responses to Interrogatories at JA-189 to 190, he\nidentifies the factual basis for the pondcrete\nallegations that he is asserting. And that factual\nbasis is described he is asserting and that factual\nbasis is described as Rockwell's knowing storage of\npondcrete on outdoor pads at the plant in violation of\nRCRA with false certification from 1987 to 1989.\nNow, he left his job in March of 1986. How\ncould he possibly have direct and independent knowledge\nof those predicate acts?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose a company\nhas a plan to defraud the Government and it use a\ncertain chemical mix to save money and that's what the\nreal fraud is. And it puts it in place and it puts it\nin place in 1988. And the -- and it has just two\ncontainers full of this. And the relator knows about\nit. The relator then quits. Then for 10 years the\ncompany does the same thing, following the same\npatterns, same method, same improper formula.\nAnd he then rings -- he then brings this to\nthe attention of the Government in the proper way and\nfiles a suit. He cannot recover for the later action\nwhich was the same pattern, practice?\nMS. MAHONEY: Perhaps, Your Honor, in\ncertain circumstances. I think the key question is\nwhat's the standard, and he has to have substantial\nknowledge about core fraudulent acts. And it may be\nreasonable in your hypothetical or some others to infer\nthat he knew plenty about this fraudulent conduct and\nhad plenty of reason to conclude that it was continuing\non.\nBut here, Your Honor, nothing of the kind\nhappened. He didn't know about any fraudulent conduct\npertaining to pondcrete before he left. And In fact,\nhis allegations start in 1987. He does not say that\nthere were pondcrete violations before then and indeed\nthere were not.\nThe reason there weren't is because when he\nwas at the plant Rockwell was producing hard pondcrete,\nhard pondcrete, and it wasn't storing it on site, it was\nshipping it to Nevada. So he couldn't -- and it wasn't\neven clear that it was subject to RCRA because DOE\ndidn't enter into a RCRA compliance agreement until\nafter he left.\nHe also concedes in his deposition that he\nwas not, except with one exception -- he was not aware\nof any time when Rockwell affirmatively represented that\nit was in compliance with environmental safety and\nhealth provisions when it was not. That's JA-106. So\nhe didn't -- unlike your hypothetical, he didn't know\nanything about there being a pondcrete fraud prior to\nthe time of his departure and doesn't even allege one.\nInstead, what the Tenth Circuit rested upon was the fact\nthat he had reviewed a design for making pondcrete 5\nyears -- in fact, not for making pondcrete; it was\nactually a design for removing sludge from the ponds --\n5 years before any of the events at issue here, and he\nsaid he predicted there would be a design problem.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It wouldn't have to\nhave anything to do with pondcrete at all. The statute\njust says the information on which his allegations are\nbased. They don't say the allegations that eventually\ngive rise to a recovery.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, every court that\nhas considered that question has said that it has to be\nanalyzed on what they call a claim by claim basis. Let\nme explain the reason. First of all, let me explain\nwhat they mean by claim by claim. They really mean a\nfactual theory of falsity, and that it has to be done on\na claim by claim basis, and here's why --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Factual theory of falsity,\nthat doesn't mean anything to me.\nMS. MAHONEY: A theory of falsity. In other\nwords, a claim, what is called a claim in these cases in\nthe claim by claim analysis is a theory of falsity. In\nother words, it's why were -- why was the fraudulent\nclaim false? Because there may be a certification, for\ninstance, of compliance with let's say all laws and\nthere could be five different, completely different fact\npatterns as to why that was false, and the damages might\nbe completely differ as well.\nSo all of the courts have said that's really\nthe way that FCA cases are litigated, that's really what\nwe call a claim.\nAnd then, moving back, if you didn't do it\non a claim by claim basis, you would allow a relator to\ncopy an indictment that he knows nothing about, come to\ncourt, file it, add one theory that he does know about,\nan overcharge for five dollars on a hammer, say that,\nI'm now entitled to proceed on the whole thing and if\nthe Government doesn't intervene I get a minimum of 25\npercent of the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's one way to\nlook at it. Another way would be you would allow a\nrelator in a situation who alleges a particular fraud\nthat causes the government to examine the books and\nuncovers a different fraud to recover on that basis.\nIt's an unusual situation to have a jurisdictional\nprerequisite determined only after the case is over.\nMS. MAHONEY: But, Your Honor, it doesn't\nhave to be determined after the case is over. These\ninquiries should -- it should have been determined here\nas well at the very outset of the case. And it was. It\nwas just determined wrong.\nWe do not have to show that it was wrong at\nthe end of the trial in order to prevail in this case.\nIt was wrong at the beginning. The interrogatories --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you only show\nthat it's wrong at the end, you still say that they\nshould be thrown out.\nMS. MAHONEY: Yes, we do, Your Honor but it\nis not by any means necessary to the outcome in this\ncase. And the reason why I think that you do have to at\nleast allow for the possibility of looking at the end of\nthe case, whether there is jurisdiction or not, is\nbecause of the nature of this particular jurisdictional\nbar. This is a jurisdictional bar that turns on the\nnature of the allegations at issue in the case.\nMuch like -- I think the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act is a perfect example because it too talks\nabout jurisdiction being predicated on, for instance,\ncommercial -- claims that are based upon commercial\nactivity. Suppose that the plaintiff at the outset of\nthe case when the 12(b)(1) motion is filed posits one\ntheory of the case that involves a predicate commercial\nact. But when it gets to trial he's abandoned that\ntheory and now he doesn't have any commercial act.\nSurely the Court would say you have to satisfy\njurisdiction over the theory that has actually gone to\ntrial.\nThis statute is very much the same. And it\nshould not be read in a way that allows relators to\nsimply disguise the true basis of their claims, hide the\nrelevance of the public information, and then just shift\ngears when you get to trial.\nBut here again, if we just look at the very\nbeginning of the case, he does identify in those\ninterrogatory responses, for instance, what the factual\nbasis for the pondcrete allegations are. All that\nfactual basis is all identified as -- as core acts that\noccurred after he left the plant. So we can look back\nin this case and say that the trial court erred at the\noutset by not dismissing this portion of his claim as\nwell as, in fact, should have dismissed the whole thing,\nYour Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, his allegation\nwas that this, the design is not going to work.\nMS. MAHONEY: But Your Honor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not an\nallegation that's -- I mean, it is either true or it's\nnot true. The fact that you find out after he's left,\nafter he's been terminated, that it doesn't work, I\ndon't see how that should affect the validity of his\nallegations.\nMS. MAHONEY: Because, Your Honor, this,\nthis is a statute about fraud. It's not a statute\nthat's violated because Rockwell may have had a\nsuboptimal pipe. That's not, that's not even the RCRA\nviolation. That's not -- and it is certainly not a\nFalse Claims Act violation. They weren't selling\npondcrete to the United States. He didn't know about a\nplan to defraud the United States.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They were certifying\ntheir compliance with the applicable laws --\nMS. MAHONEY: At that, at the time --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- based upon their\npondcrete design.\nMS. MAHONEY: At the time that he was there\nthat was not actually -- he didn't even allege that he\nknew they were doing that with respect to pondcrete. He\ndidn't allege that there were any problems with respect\nto the pondcrete production or, or certifications during\nhis tenure. From -- they began producing pondcrete in\n1985, Your Honor. And there were no problems that were\nalleged with respect to that pondcrete.\nHis claim by his own admission starts in\n1987, after he was gone. And again, the mere fact that\nthere may have been a defective pipe wouldn't establish\nthe RCRA violation, because what they had to show by\ntheir owning pleading here was that they were storing it\non site, that it was actually leaking, and, of course,\nthe mere fact there may have been a problem with the\npipe doesn't mean it is actually going to leak, because\nthey can fix it in a variety of ways. They can add more\ncement, they can put it in metal containers, they can do\na myriad of things.\nHe didn't even say he knew know that there\nwas a plan to not remedy and problems in the design that\nhe had identified if and when there became a problem\nwith it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Am, am I correct that they\nwere, in fact, using that same pipe or that same pipe\nsystem during a period when perfectly fine cement blocks\nwere being produced?\nMS. MAHONEY: We think that's correct, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that true, is that\nconceded?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, I think that it's\nconceded that -- well, their own counsels told the jury\nthat they were making it wrong, they weren't adding\nenough cement, that that was the reason that it was\nfailing; and the Government told the jury that they were\nmaking it fine until they reduced the ratio of cement.\nSo yes, I think it is correct that it has been conceded\nat trial that the system was working fine as long as\nthey were adding enough cement.\nBut instead what happens after he left --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The whole purpose,\nthe whole purpose of this legislation is to ferret out\nfraud on the Government. I mean, if he makes an\nallegation that this design is not going to work, the\npondcrete is not going to work, and the Government,\nprompted by his lawsuit, investigates it and finds out\nthat because of human error they're not making it the\nright way, even if the design does work, he get no\ncredit for that?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor, the statute\nisn't written in that way. But let me also call your\nattention to some facts. And that is that a year before\nhe brought this claim --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what about the\nhypothetical? Are you suggesting that in a situation\nlike that -- -we'll talk about whether the facts comport\nwith it later -- but in a situation like that, he's not\nentitled to share in the recovery that the Government\neventually receives?\nMS. MAHONEY: If -- the mere fact that he is\na trigger for the Government discovery of a different\nproblem, no, that is not a basis for recovery. The\nstatute says that if there has been a public disclosure,\nif -- let's assume there was a public disclosure. If\nthere's no public disclosure it is no problem. He can\nbring whatever claim he wants. He doesn't have to have\ndirect knowledge of it. Bit if there has been a public\ndisclosures at that point he has to have direct\nknowledge of the information on which the allegations\nare based. And that has to be a substantial standard.\nDirect knowledge is one of the key things that the Tenth\nCircuit just did not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would, you would\nchange that to say direct knowledge of the information\nnot on which the allegations are based, but on which\nrecovery is eventually -- eventually ordered?\nMS. MAHONEY: On which the allegations of\nthe claim is based. In other words, it, it's not -- it\nhas to be -- and the Government says this as well --\nthey say under that Section D(1), the relator isn't\nentitled to share in the proceeds of anything that the\njury gives. The relator is only entitled to share in\nthe proceeds of a claim for which they were an original\nsource or for which they brought the -- brought the\naction under, under Section B.\nSometimes the Government intervenes and adds\nits own claims not on behalf of the relator, because it\ndoesn't have authority on behalf of the relator, and it\ntakes the position, I think correctly, that the relator\nisn't entitled to a share in those circumstances.\nAnd Your Honor, this -- the courts have\nidentified all the ways in which this statute doesn't\nmake any sense if it is looked at on --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Identified them all?\nMS. MAHONEY: -- on a global basis. Excuse\nme?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They've identified\nthem all already?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MAHONEY: No, I don't think they have\nidentified them all. But I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You may find another one.\nMS. MAHONEY: I, I would also -- again, it\nwould allow the relator to get, you know, a share of,\nwhen the Government doesn't intervene, a minimum of 25\npercent of a billion dollar recovery after a public\ndisclosure that he knew nothing about, if he just knew\none little piece after separate theory of fraud.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the theory is not\nnecessarily bad. The, the relator has to cooperate with\nthe Government, ideally he should. And if the\nGovernment said we prefer a variance of your theory, and\nthe relator said fine, \"I don't want to put competing\ntheories before the jury, so I'll surrender my first\ntheory and go with the Government's,\" why should the\nrelator be penalized for that good litigation practice?\nIt doesn't necessarily mean that the original complaint\nis no good or even that it might not have been proved,\nif the Government had preferred another route.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well it there, if there's a\nminor variation, you know, something like that, I\ncertainly don't think that disqualifies the relator\nfrom, from being an original source. And again, here he\nwasn't an original source even under his own theory at\nthe outset of the case.\nWhat happened at trial is the one little\nthing that he knew or claimed to know, his prediction\nthat a pipe would have a problem five years before, was\ndropped completely from the case. So he went from being\na relator who knew something very small about the case\nor about the theories to nothing at all. It was never\ngood enough, but certainly once, once that theory was --\nonce that piece of information dropped out, it just\ndemonstrated, it just highlights that he's not an\noriginal source.\nAnd Your Honor, here it wasn't just that\nthey didn't want to use that bit of evidence. It was\nactually inconsistent with the theory that they, that\nthey pressed with the jury. They said the equipment was\nfine. Rockwell was making pondcrete just fine from 1985\nforward until it stopped adding the cement.\nAnd that's what they -- that's the theory\nthey went with. But again, measure it at the outset of\nthe case, and he still wasn't an original source.\nIf I could save the remainder of my time?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask just one quick\nquestion?\nMS. MAHONEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What was the public\ndisclosure of the claim that ultimately prevailed?\nMS. MAHONEY: The public -- there -- the\npublic disclosure was in 19 -- it can be from several\npieces. But in 1988, there were widely covered stories\nof the fact that pondcrete was being stored at Rocky\nFlats on outdoor pads, that it was leaking and that the\nreason it was occurring was because the employees had\nreduced the ratio of cement.\nAnd then you couple that with the disclosure\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the public disclosure\nwas made in the newspapers rather than in an official\nGovernment proceeding?\nMS. MAHONEY: That's correct. It was in the\nnewspapers. But it was definitely covered, Your Honor.\nAnd that was more than a year before he brought his\naction. And then in addition, there were disclosures of\nallegations of performance bonuses being paid based upon\nfalsified evaluations. That's JA 143.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Mahoney.\nMs. Vullo.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARIA T. VULLO,\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT STONE\nMS. VULLO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court.\nThe Court should affirm the decision of the\nCourt of Appeals because as the Government recognizes,\nMr. Stone is an original source. And it is important to\nthe look at the statute and its purpose. The original\nsource provision is intended to determine who may bring\na claim on behalf of the United States Government. And\nthe recovery provision, 3730(d)(1), determines how much\nif anything a relator may share in the Government's\nrecovery. In this case, whether where the Government\nfully supports the relator, I would submit that the\ninterests of the statute and the interests of the United\nStates are fully satisfied.\nAnd that is because Mr. Stone is the\nparadigm not parasitic relator. He had knowledge\nfirsthand from his six years at Rockwell of a pattern,\nJustice Kennedy, a pattern of criminal conduct and a\npattern of Rockwell concealing that information.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unfortunately, it was not\nthe criminal conduct that was ultimately -- it was not\nthe manner of criminal conduct that was ultimately the\nbasis on which the Government proceeded? He knew about\nthis bad pipe, right? Or he said that this was a bad\npipe system? He didn't say anything as I understand it\nabout their not adding enough cement which is the theory\nthat went to the jury.\nMS. VULLO: Justice Scalia, I would beg to\ndiffer on that. Mr. Stone in his affidavit at 179 in\nthe joint appendix and also in his disclosure statement,\nwhich is at 29 -- I'm sorry, 174 and 175 of the joint\nappendix, and the disclosure statement at 290, what he\ndescribed was a defective design of the system for\ntaking the sludge out of the pond. And what he\nspecifically said -- and this is very important -- what\nhe specifically said was when you took the sludge out of\nthe ponds in that manner, it was going to have too much\nliquid, and it was going to lead to deterioration of the\nenvironment. He said that in the very beginning of the\ncase. And at trial, what the testimony was -- and I\nwould direct the Court to Mr. Freibach's testimony at\njoint appendix 522, as well as at the trial transcript\nat 987, the issue there was the variability of the\nsludge which may have caused greater inspections and may\nhave required additional cement.\nAnd what is very important is even\nMr. Freibach who is the first foreman, on whom\npetitioners rely, he testified that during his tenure,\nthe variation of the sludge required between 200 and 350\npounds of cement. That's at the trial transcript at 987\nand the joint appendix at 522.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah. Let me -- let me\nlook at what -- let me look at 175. This is, this what\nhe says. \"After careful study, I concluded that the\nsuggested process\" -- this means of piping the sludge\nout -- \"would result in an unstable mixture that would\nlater deteriorate and cause unwanted release of toxic\nwastes to the environment. I also noted based on my\nanalysis of chemical processes at Rocky Flats that that\nthe sludge and liquid present in the -- present in the\nevaporation ponds contained some of the most toxic and\nradioactive substances at Rocky Flats.\"\nI mean, that's all very good, but it has\nnothing to do with what this company was convicted of,\nwhich is not -- cutting down on the amount of cement it\nwas adding.\nMS. VULLO: That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: During a certain period\nafter this it was creating perfectly good blocks by\nadding more cement. Then they got a new manager who\nsaid let's use less cement. And that's when they\nstarted producing the defective blocks. It has nothing\nto do with his allegations.\nMS. VULLO: Justice Scalia, two important\npoints. First is that neither the criminal conviction\nnor the jury's verdict determined the cause of\ninsolidity. The issue in the criminal case and the\nissue in the False Claims Act case as to pondcrete was\nthat the pondcrete was insolid and they were lying to\nthe -- the Government about that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And why did the government\nclaim it was insolid? What was the claim made for -- as\nto the reason for the insolidity?\nMS. VULLO: Your Honor, one of the pieces of\nevidence -- and I would -- out of 55 witnesses and 500\ndocuments, was that there were certain people who were\nusing too little cement. There was also evidence --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but was the reason they\nwere using too little cement, the reason that there was\na variation in the amount of liquid being taken out with\nthe sludge as you've described to us that he had\nclaimed, or was the reason simply that there was a kind\nof standard ratio of cement to sludge and that standard\nratio was not followed in the later cases?\nIn other words, is it because there was such\na tremendous variation in the liquid in the sludge or\nsimply because there was a standard formula having no\nparticular relationship to the liquid in the sludge, and\nthey simply didn't follow the standard formula? I\nthought the government's theory was the latter, and if\nit was the latter, it has nothing to do with the claim\nthat he was making that there was too much variation in\nthe amount of liquid in the sludge.\nMS. VULLO: That's not correct,\nJustice Souter. The reason for the variation and the\nneed for additional cement was because the sludge had\nvariations and there was too much liquid in it, which\nwas precisely what Mr. Stone said. And every one of the\nwitnesses testified to huge variation of the liquid\ncontent in the sludge which required more cement, and\neven the amount of cement that was required was very\nvariable.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if they had followed\nthe formula that they followed at the beginning, isn't\nit true that there's no evidence that even these\nvariations in the liquid in the sludge would have\nresulted in instable or insolid pondcrete?\nMS. VULLO: No. That's not correct,\nJustice Souter. In fact, there was no particular ratio\nthat had to be followed of cement to sludge. There was\ntestimony that different individuals who worked on the\npondcrete used different amounts of cement. And as I\nsaid --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: This was truly even before\nthe troubles started, even before the insolid pondcrete?\nMR. STEWART: Yes, Your Honor. Yes,\nJustice Souter. Mr. Freibach, who was the earlier\nforeman, testified that under his watch, he needed\nbetween 250 and 300 pounds of cement, and that there was\na constant inconsistency in the sludge content coming\nout of the ponds.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was -- here's an easy\nquestion. Was this evidence that we read, his testimony\nfrom 175 of the joint appendix, was that introduced at\nthe trial?\nMS. VULLO: Mr. Stone did not testify at\ntrial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was this evidence\nintroduced from some other source? Was the jury told\nthere was this piping that was taking out too much\nliquid with the sludge? Was the jury told that?\nMS. VULLO: The jury -- Mr. Freibach\ndescribed the process. We did not get into the\nengineering detail, Your Honor, of it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So his central allegation\nwas not even placed before the jury?\nMS. VULLO: Your Honor, I would submit to\nyou, Justice Scalia, that that wasn't required. What we\nneeded to prove --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it is worse than\nthat, though.\nThis information was not even provided to\nthe government, which the statute requires. He not only\nhas to have direct and independent knowledge, he has to\nvoluntarily provide that to the government. And I\nunderstand that the Tenth Circuit, to have relied solely\non the document at joint appendix page 605, that's the\nonly thing he provided to the government. And all it\nsays is that this design will not work. There are a lot\nof things that don't work, but that doesn't mean there's\nfraud on the government. You don't know if they're\ngoing to fix it, they're going to change it, use a\ndifferent design, not make a claim based on that design.\nWhy is that enough to satisfy the statute?\nMS. VULLO: Mr. Chief Justice, the\nvoluntarily provides prong requires the relator to be\nhonest and truthful and submit all the information he\nhas. And Mr. Stone did that and the government has\nnever said otherwise. In fact, he met with the FBI\nagent --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he has to -- if\nthe information that he provides isn't direct and\nindependent information of the allegations, it would\nseem that the statute is not satisfied.\nMS. VULLO: That is correct, Your Honor, but\nMr. Stone did have direct and independent knowledge of\nhis allegations. And I'd like to go back to the\ndiscussion with petitioner's counsel as to the\njurisdictional petition in this statute. There is no\nquestion that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't want to get\noff my question here but did you -- do you agree that\nthis page JA 605 was the only information that he\nprovided to the government?\nMS. VULLO: No, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe I'd\nbetter phrase it differently. Do you agree that that is\nthe only information on which the Tenth Circuit relied?\nMS. VULLO: That, the Tenth Circuit did rely\non that document and did not consider any other\ninformation as a result of its ruling with respect to\nthat document. The Tenth Circuit also had before it the\nawards fee documents which Mr. Stone provided to the\ngovernment, and those are at joint appendix 247 to 249.\nIt also had Mr. Stone's affidavit when he testified in\nhis affidavit as to his meetings with the government,\nand also had additional affidavits --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but this -- he\nhas to provide this information before filing an action.\nMS. VULLO: That's correct, Your Honor. And\nhis affidavit describes his meetings with the FBI and\nEPA beginning in 1986, and that's at joint appendix 180\nthrough 181.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I have a question.\nMS. VULLO: Yes, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: As I understand the\nstatute, you his the first prong. It has to be an\naction based on public disclosure of information, which\nyou agree it was; is that right?\nMS. VULLO: Justice Stevens, we in the\ncourts below agreed for purposes of the original source\nprovision that there was a public disclosure. I think\nwhat's important following up on the question --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You agree that it's within\n4(a), that it was an action based on a public disclosure\nof information disclosed in newspapers; is that right?\nMS. VULLO: In newspapers and also the\ncriminal investigation, but I think what's important is\nthat the standard that Rockwell seeks to have this Court\nadopt would actually require such a great level of\nspecificity that is not in the public disclosure at all.\nAnd I think, Justice Stevens, you asked that precise\nquestion. The public disclosure was very general. And\nthe Tenth Circuit --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I am asking you, really\nwhat I'm seeking to find out is what is the scope of the\npublic disclosure that everyone agrees was made? Was it\nall newspapers?\nMS. VULLO: It was newspapers, and the FBI\nagents' search warrant affidavit was also publicly\ndisclosed prior to Mr. Stone's filing of the action.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If it was publicly\ndisclosed in the newspapers, does that fit into one of\nthe categories of public disclosure mentioned in 4(a)?\nMS. VULLO: Yes. It says news reports in\nthat provision of the statute.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And everybody agrees on\nwhat those news reports contained?\nMS. VULLO: Well, I'm not sure what Rockwell\nagrees, but I could tell Your Honor what I believe those\nnews reports said, and they said that there were\nenvironmental violations. There were some news reports\nin June of 1988 about a spill on the pondcrete pads.\nNot a single one of the news reports about the spill on\nthe pondcrete pads described at all any false claim or\nfalse statement, and neither did the agents' search\nwarrant affidavit.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you're saying that the\noriginal source of the information was published?\nMS. VULLO: I don't believe that that's the\nappropriate test. It's not before this Court, but I\nbelieve that the direct and independent knowledge\nrequirement is information on which the allegations are\nbased, and the allegations refer to Mr. Stone's\nallegations at the commencement of the action. After\nall, it's a jurisdictional provision, and it should be\ndetermined at the outset of the action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought\nthe allegations referred to the public disclosure. It\ntalks about public disclosure of allegations, and then\nsays he has to have direct and independent knowledge of\nthe allegations. So I would assume that's the important\nlinkage.\nMS. VULLO: Mr. Chief Justice, there is a\nsplit in the circuits on that issue. The issue was not\ndecided by the Court of Appeals and as I understand even\nRockwell's position, that is not Rockwell's position,\nthat Rockwell's position is like our position, that it's\ninformation in the allegations of the complaint.\nBut I would submit that that would make no\ndifference in this case because Mr. Stone's knowledge is\ndirect and independent of the information in his\ncomplaint as well as the information in the public\ndisclosure. And what is important is that Rockwell is\nasking this Court to adopt the quick trigger that the\nCourt of Appeals adopted because that was the Tenth\nCircuit's law on public disclosure. Yet in this case,\nsay that Mr. Stone's direct and independent knowledge\nhas to be very, very specific. It has to be of the\nparticular false statements, and that would eviscerate\nthe entire original source rule.\nAnd if I could just get to the point of the\njurisdictional issue and why Rockwell's position as to\nthe trial evidence is wrong, it's wrong for two reasons.\nThe first is that the statute speaks in terms of\nallegations. It does not speak in terms of evidence.\nIn fact, in the provision E.2, which is a provision\nregarding bringing claims against members of the\njudiciary and members of Congress, Congress said\ninformation or evidence, but in this provision E.4,\nCongress only said information. So looking at the trial\nevidence would be wrong by virtue of the plain language\nof the statute.\nIt also would be wrong as, Mr. Chief\nJustice, you pointed out. Since 1824, I believe this\nCourt has held that jurisdiction is determined at the\ntime of commencement as of the state of things at that\ntime. And as, Justice Ginsburg, you pointed out, it\nwould be an inappropriate rule to say that if the\ngovernment decides to refine the allegation, after all,\nit is still a concrete allegation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We've also said that\njurisdiction must be maintained throughout the case.\nSomething like standing. We say standing is examined\nthroughout the trial. There's an easier standard at the\nbeginning, and then for the complaint; and then for a\nmotion to dismiss, a somewhat higher standard; and\nfinally, if the facts of -- involving standing are\ntried, there's the highest standard at the end of the\ntrial.\nI mean, it seems to me jurisdiction has to\nbe assured throughout.\nMS. VULLO: Justice Scalia, I think this is\na jurisdictional provision that Congress created. We're\nnot talking about the Federal question jurisdictional\nstatute. But in this provision, just like in the Clean\nWater Act in the Walton case, the statute uses the word\nallegations. As in that case, the statute used the word\nalleged. And the Court held very clearly that you look\nat it as of commencement.\nNow it might be a different case if we had a\nfederal question case and the relator or the plaintiff\nwithdrew the Federal claim. Then there would be a loss\nof jurisdiction. Here of course, the amended complaint\nsatisfied jurisdiction when the government adopted the\nrelator's claim.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Vullo.\nMr. Stewart?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATES\nMR. STEWART: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nOne of the features of this case that may\nappear anomalous is the fact that the government is\naligned with Stone. That is, it's Rockwell's position\nthat the entire recovery in this case should go to the\nUnited States. It is Stone's position that the recovery\nshould be shared with the relator, and the government\nagrees with Stone.\nIt might be natural for the Court to wonder,\nwhy would it be in the government's interest to advocate\nthat a share of the money damages in this case should be\ngiven to a private party. And the reason is that the\ngovernment believes that there are three systemic\ngovernment interests that are implicated by this case\nand that would be endangered if Rockwell's position\nprevailed.\nFirst, in our view, Stone is precisely the\ntype of relator that Congress intended to encourage.\nStone was somebody who had substantial firsthand\nknowledge of Rockwell's environmental practices and of\nits billing practices, and moreover, Stone was somebody\nwho didn't conceal his information from the government.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's all very nice,\nbut Congress didn't leave it up to you to decide who\nought to get rewarded or not. It laid down some textual\nconditions in the statute. And unless they are complied\nwith, the fact that you think this is the kind of person\nyou think ought to get the money is really totally\nirrelevant.\nMR. STEWART: We agree. And as to Stone's\noriginal complaint, the statute frames the inquiry as\nwhether Stone has direct and independent knowledge of\nthe information on which the allegations were based.\nAnd we agree with Rockwell and with Stone that that\nrefers to the allegations in his complaint.\nNow the allegations were fairly generalized.\nThey didn't refer specifically to pondcrete, and they\ncovered a wide range of time, from 1980 through to the\npresent, which was 1989 as of the filing of the\ncomplaint. Stone subsequently submitted a lengthy\naffidavit in which he explained what led him to the\nconclusion that Rockwell was engaged in a systematic\npractice of violating the environmental laws and\nmisrepresenting the nature of its compliance to the\ngovernment. That information --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the defect that he\nidentified turns out to be entirely different? What if\nthere is no dispute, it's completely different from the\ndefects that led to the false claims on which there were\nrecovery?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, there certainly could\nbe a situation in which the government intervenes in a\nsuit but files what can be regarded as a substantially\ndifferent claim. For instance, if the government had\nintervened in this suit and had claimed that Rockwell's\nrequests for payment were fraudulent because Rockwell\nhad misrepresented its compliance with the\nanti-discrimination laws, that would be an example of a\nfundamentally different fraudulent scheme and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's take this case. Did\nthe government use any of the evidence that Stone\nproduced? Did it introduce that affidavit which said\nthe pipe wasn't working right? Was that part of the\nevidence?\nMR. STEWART: It didn't introduce the\nengineering report. And I do want to focus on --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what else had he\nprovided beyond -- did you use anything that came from\nhim?\nMR. STEWART: He had provided substantial\ninformation about a pattern of concealment of\nenvironmental violations generally. That at least to\nsome extent was responsible for an FBI investigation\nwhich uncovered further --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But did you use at trial\nanything that he provided you?\nMR. STEWART: We proved essentially the\nstate of affairs that he predicted would occur.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did you use anything he\nprovided you in order to prove it?\nMR. STEWART: I'm not aware of anything\nthat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, neither am I.\nMR. STEWART: But nevertheless, the relator\nhad direct and independent knowledge of the information\non which his allegations were based.\nAnd I'd like to focus on this question of\nthe cause of the insolidity of the pondcrete because I\nthink to regard that as the theory of the government's\nliability really reflects a misunderstanding of the\nFalse Claims Act. For purposes of the False Claims Act\ncounts in this case, it was sufficient for the\ngovernment to prove that the pondcrete in fact failed,\nleaked hazardous substances into the environment, that\nRockwell was aware that the pondcrete was failing, and\nthat Rockwell nevertheless continued to represent that\nit was in compliance with the environmental laws.\nFor purposes of proving those allegations,\nit was not necessary for the Government to offer any\nhypothesis as to why the pondcrete failed. It would\nhave been sufficient to prove that the pondcrete failed\nand that Rockwell knew about it. In fact, I wouldn't\nencourage the Court to read the whole trial transcript,\nbut I think if the Court reads the plaintiff's statement\nof claims, which is about 30 pages of the joint appendix\nbeginning at JA-463, that summarizes the events that\nRockwell -- I mean, I'm sorry, that Stone and the United\nStates intended to prove at trial, and by far the\npredominant focus is on the fact of pondcrete failures\nand Rockwell's awareness that they had -- that pondcrete\nhad failed.\nThere were a couple of paragraphs in\nthose 30 pages that alluded to the supposition that the\ncause of the failure was inadequate cement content.\nThere were also isolated references to that theory at\ntrial. But to characterize that as the theory of\nliability I think would be a misconception. The\nGovernment didn't have to persuade the jury one way or\nthe other as to why the pondcrete failed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How is it possible to say\nthat he had direct knowledge of events that occurred\nafter he had left Rockwell? I mean, all of this failure\noccurred after he was gone.\nMR. STEWART: But again --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not only not because of\nthis pipe thing that he predicted would cause a failure,\nnot only it was not because of that. But he was gone.\nMR. STEWART: Again, the statute doesn't\nrequire direct and independent knowledge of the fraud.\nIt requires direct and independent knowledge of the\ninformation on which the allegations were based.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. And how\nwould he know except from published report that these\nblocks were failing?\nMR. STEWART: His basis for making that\nprediction was that he believed that the process would\nmalfunction. He was also aware --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But prediction is not\nknowledge. Prediction is not direct knowledge.\nMR. STEWART: I think independent of whether\nthere had every been a public disclosure, it would have\nbeen open to Rockwell to argue in response to the\noriginal complaint that Stone couldn't consistent with\nRule 11 make allegations as to what had happened at the\nplant after he left because he no longer had an\nevidentiary basis for doing so. Rockwell could have\nmade that argument, again regardless of whether a public\ndisclosure had occurred, and the question whether it is\na permissible inference for a plaintiff to say, I saw\nthem committing systematic environmental violations\nwhile I was there and I inferred that the same thing\nwould go on after I left -- the question that's a\npermissible inference for a plaintiff in a Federal civil\naction to make is a question to be decided under the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. The public disclosure\nprovision serves a different purpose entirely. It's\ndesigned for those cases in which the relator has\nsufficient information to file a complaint that complies\nwith the federal rules of similar procedure, but that\ninformation overlaps substantially with information in\nthe public domain.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And his sufficient\ninformation you assert is his prediction that these\nblocks would fail for a reason that turned out not to be\nthe reason for their failure. That is what you say is\nhis direct knowledge.\nMR. STEWART: That knowledge, but I think\nit's also important to recognize that the original\ncomplaint was not focused on pondcrete specifically.\nThe original complaint alleged more generally that\nRockwell was engaged in widespread environmental safety\nand health violations and was consistently\nmisrepresenting to the Government that it was in\ncompliance and -- even though it knew that it was not\ndoing so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you think relators can\nget part of the Government's recovery even where their\ninitial allegations before the Government intervenes\nhave nothing whatever to do with the reason the\nGovernment is ultimately giving money? You think they\nare still entitled to a piece of the pie?\nMR. STEWART: I guess I would -- I would\ndisagree with the premise that his reasons had nothing\nwhatever to do with why the Government is getting money.\nAgain to return to the hypothetical I suggested earlier,\nif the Government then filed --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you don't believe that,\nthen. You think that indeed the reason the Government\nwas given the money has to be connected with, with his\nallegations? Right?\nMR. STEWART: It has to be connected with\nhis allegations. And certainly, if you look at the\ntheory of liability that prevailed at trial, namely that\npondcrete blocks were leaking hazardous substances into\nthe environment and Rockwell was nevertheless asking for\nGovernment funds based on misrepresentations that it was\nin compliance, if you look at that theory of liability\nand then examine Stone's original complaint, clearly\nthat theory is logically encompassed within the more\ngeneralized --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you mean by\nconnected? Is it -- I got -- I'm getting the sense that\nyou think it's enough that he says, look, Rockwell is\njust lying to the Government in this area, and you say\nwell -- what if what if you added a count in your\ncomplaint when you intervene on tax fraud? You found\nout also that they didn't pay taxes. Would he be able\nto recover for that, because, you know, if they're going\nto lie about pondcrete they're going to lie about taxes.\nIs that sufficiently connected?\nMR. STEWART: No, and I think I would put\nthat with the hypothetical that I offered about the\nGovernment adding a claim that Rockwell had\nmisrepresented its compliance with the\nantidiscrimination laws. And I think there won't be a\nclear dividing line, but I think this is a line that\ncourts have to draw for other purposes as well.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it doesn't\nmatter to you if he just, if he's completely wrong?\nLet's say he says -- you have special interrogatories to\nthe jury and his allegation has always been the\npondcrete's going to fail because you're putting in the\nwrong kind of cement. And it turns out it has nothing\nto do with that at all. The jury says, no, that's not\nthe reason it failed, it failed for another reason. Is\nthat a sufficient connection?\nMR. STEWART: I think we would -- I think\nthere could still be a sufficient connection even if his\nreason for thinking the pondcrete failed, they all\nturned out to be correct. And again, we would emphasize\nthat that's particularly so here because the reason for\nthe pondcrete failure was not an element of the claim.\nI mean, imagine if this case had been tried to the jury\nand there had been an established rule in place that if\nthe pondcrete was shown to have failed because of a\ndefect in the machinery, Stone would get a share, but if\nit was shown to have failed because the human operator\nadded too little cement Stone wouldn't get a share. If\nthat had been the rule there would have been a clear\npotential for disharmony between the Government and the\nrelator. It would have raised exactly the specter that\nJustice Ginsburg alluded to, where the Government\nprefers to emphasize one view of the facts rather than\nanother and the defendant is getting in the way by\nsuggesting that the relator will be deprived of a share.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Try this hypothetical. The\nrelator says: I know that they've been cheating the\nGovernment because I, I observed the president of the\ncompany going into a meeting with the chief engineer and\nanother person, and at that meeting I suspect they were\ndevising this scheme to defraud the Government.\nIt turns out there was indeed a scheme to\ndefraud the Government, but that meeting never occurred.\nIt wasn't the president of the company who went into the\nmeeting. It was Charlie Chaplin. And the facts are\ntotally, totally wrong. Does he get money?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does he get money just\nbecause he came out with the same charge that the\nGovernment ultimately proves? Simply because he said\nthe company is guilty of cheating the Government, even\nthough the facts on which he bases it are entirely\nwrong?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I need to know more\nabout the hypothetical, but my initial reaction is that\nthat's a complaint that's easily dismissed based on Rule\n11, leaving aside the question of any public disclosure.\nAnd I can imagine extreme hypotheticals --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, assume one that just\ngets over the line.\nMR. STEWART: I think if the complaint just\ngets over the line, that is if the evidence in the\nrelator's possession is just barely good enough to\nsustain the allegation of fraud or at least to allow the\nsuit to go forward, there's no reason to read the public\ndisclosure --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It turns out to be entirely\nwrong. Turns out to be entirely wrong, so that the only\nreason he believed this company was defrauding the\nGovernment was absolutely wrong.\nMR. STEWART: I think we would still want to\ncompare the nature of the fraud that the Government\nalleged with the nature of the fraud that the relator\nalleged. And obviously this is a question in which the\nCourt is going to have to balance competing interests.\nIt's possible to come up with hypotheticals in which it\nseems as though the relator has no equitable entitlement\nto a share. The two things we want to emphasize are,\nfirst, in terms of the way that the lawsuit progresses\neven when the Government doesn't intervene, relators\nonce they file suit, if they are allowed to proceed on\ntheir own, they presumably can take advantage of all of\nthe rules of civil procedure. And those include the\ndiscovery provisions of the Federal Rules.\nAnd it would obviously be self-defeating to\ntell the relator: You can invoke discovery and you can\nlearn relevant information from the defendant, but if\nyou didn't know it already you can't use it at trial,\nbecause if you use something that you didn't have direct\nand independent knowledge of before the complaint was\nfiled and it turns out to be persuasive to the jury you\ncan be kicked for not being an original source.\nI don't think Congress can be said to have\nhad that intention.\nSecond, in cases where the Government and\nthe relator intervenes -- where the Government\nintervenes in the a relator's suit and the two prosecute\nthe suit together, we would want the Court to avoid a\nrule that would create artificial disincentives to\ncooperation between the two plaintiffs. And the idea\nthat relatively minor variations in factual assertions\nthat are ultimately not necessary to the establishment\nof False Claims Act liability, if those carried the day\nthen relators in future circumstances would have a\nstrong disincentive to accede to the Government's\nrequest that one view of the evidence be emphasized\nrather than another.\nIf the Court has nothing, no further\nquestions --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Explain why it would be a\nminor variation if what he has identified as a defect in\nthe pipe system and what turns out to be the situation\nthat was covered up is the inadequate cement that caused\nthe loss?\nMR. STEWART: It's a minor variation in the\nsense that it's not relevant to the defendant's ultimate\nliability. That is, if we had proved that the pondcrete\nleaked hazardous substances into the environment and\nthat Rockwell knew that it was having that effect and\nthat it nevertheless represented to the Government it\nwas in compliance, that would be enough to establish the\nknowing submission of a false claim even if we had no\nidea what was the reason for the pondcrete failure.\nAnd even if Rockwell had taken the most\nHerculean measures to produce good pondcrete and had not\ndeparted from standards of care in any respect, if\nnevertheless they knew that the pondcrete was in fact\nfailing despite their best efforts and they represented\nthat it was succeeding, they would be liable under the\nFalse Claims Act.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question:\nSupposing he is the only source of the information\nthat's publicly disclosed on which precipitated the\nfiling of the complaint, and after the complaint is\nfiled discovery reveals other violations of law on which\nthe Government prevails, but they do not prevail on the\ntheory of the original complaint. Would he be -- come\nwithin the statute or without? The statute focuses on\nthe information that gave rise to the suit, not on\nwhat's found by way of discovery.\nMR. STEWART: I mean, my instinct would be\nthat probably he could still recover. I think the\nquestion then would boil down to whether the discovery\nresponses are themselves public disclosures such that\nthey would trigger a new original source.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Assuming we only look at\nthe public information at the time the complaint is\nfiled.\nMR. STEWART: I mean, probably that question\nwould raise no public disclosure issue to begin with,\nbecause if there had been no -- at least if there had\nbeen no public disclosure of the fraudulent conduct that\nwas revealed through discovery, there would be no need\nfor him to satisfy the original source test with respect\nto those new allegations.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Stewart.\nMs. Mahoney, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. MAHONEY: I would like to first just\naddress, the Government's suggested that he could be an\noriginal source because he had knowledge of false\nrepresentations and concealments derived throughout his\nemployment. I just want to emphasize that the Tenth\nCircuit did not rely on that theory, said that he did\nnot have to have knowledge of any fraudulent acts. It\nwas just enough that he knew something that might be\nrelevant to the proof of an environmental violation.\nAnd the reason that the Tenth Circuit said that was\nbecause Stone had conceded in his deposition at pages\nJA-106 and 112 that he did not know about any false\nrepresentations and he did not know whether DOE was\naware of any of the environmental problems.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is your response to\nthe Government's assertion, which seems to me quite\ntrue, that in order to -- in order to prevail it did not\nhave to show why these blocks were not solidified?\nMS. MAHONEY: I think what --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It just had to show that\nthey weren't. So it doesn't matter whether they were\nusing his theory or too little cement. It doesn't\nmatter.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, the point is that\nMr. Stone wasn't there when the manufacturing problems\noccurred, so he didn't actually have direct knowledge\nthat pondcrete was leaking. That's the real point.\nWhat they're really saying is that his theory about why\nit might leak some day didn't turn out to be important\nto the gravamen of the claim. This is a fraud claim.\nHe didn't know anything about fraud and he couldn't have\nknown they were leaking at the time, 5 years later\nbecause he wasn't there.\nAnd the statute requires direct knowledge.\nThe Government's suggestion that somehow Rule 11 will be\nthe basis on which we can sort out who's an original\nsource and who's not strikes me as rather odd. First of\nall, nothing hardly ever gets dismissed on Rule 11\ngrounds. And this is a jurisdictional statute that\nrequires direct knowledge. A relator could read an\nindictment and satisfy Rule 10 just by copying the\nallegations. Does that count?\nI think that direct knowledge means there\ncan't be undue conjecture. The only thing that he said\nhe knew, even though it wasn't the gravamen of the\nclaim, was clearly based upon conjecture, a belief that\nin his opinion this pipe would not work.\nAnd then when we get to the trial, there\nwere 55 witnesses. Stone had not identified a single\none of them as a person with relevant knowledge at the\noutset of the case when he answered his interrogatory\nresponses. In addition, every person -- no person he\nidentified testified at the case. He identified four\ndocuments that he said were key. None of them were\nintroduced. He knew nothing about what went to trial.\nIn addition, I'd like to focus on the\n\"voluntarily provide\". That is a separate ground for\nreversal in this case, and would emphasize that the\nTenth Circuit said the engineering order that refers to\nremoval of sludge and says in my opinion this won't\nwork, that's all it says -- the Tenth Circuit says\nthat's fine. The district court made a factual finding\nthat Stone had not communicated his concerns to the\nGovernment about pondcrete, saltcrete, or spray\nirrigation, the three theories issues at issue at trial\nhere.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There were other\ndocuments. He said there were other documents and the\ndistrict court said sorry, you came up with that too\nlate, I'm not going to look at the other documents.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, what they're\nreferring to is the affidavit, I think. He filed an\naffidavit at the outset of the case when Rockwell filed\nthe motion to dismiss and then tried to do a new one 10\nyears later that was rejected.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you\nMs. Mahoney.\n"
