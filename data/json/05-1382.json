        "content": "(11:08 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now we'll hear\nargument in 05-1382, Gonzales versus Planned Parenthood\nFederation of America.\nGeneral Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice and may\nit please the Court:\nThis case presents the same basic\nconstitutional question concerning the Federal\nPartial-Birth Abortion Act as the first case. Of\ncourse, the Ninth Circuit in the decision under review\nhere went much further in invalidating the Federal act.\nIf I could begin by talking about whether what we're\ntalking about here is medical necessity or just some\nmarginal effect on the risks. I think in order to\nfairly understand the argument that respondents are\nmaking in this case, their argument has to be a matter\nof simply marginal risks, because one illustration of\nthis, as I indicated in the first argument, if a doctor\nreally believes that a D&X procedure is the way to go in\na case then there's no ban on the procedure as such.\nWhat the act bans is the infliction of the D&X procedure\non a living fetus.\nSo if a doctor really thinks the D&X\nprocedure is the way to go, he can induce fetal demise\nat the outset of the procedure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the problem with this\nis that there -- well, some doctors absolutely agree. I\nmean, you know, my list over here, in which I have\nhundreds of references from this thing, is doctor after\ndoctor who takes the other position, and they say:\nLook, all that we're doing here is trying to remove the\nfetus in a single pass. The fetus is going to die\nanyway. It's not viable. We're trying to remove it in\na single pass, and the reason we're trying to do that is\nif we don't, there may be bone fragments left inside the\nwomb. There may be fetal parts left inside the womb.\nEvery time you make another pass, it turns out there's\nan added risk of scarring or hurting the inside of the\nwomb. If you try to induce demise through a drug\nbefore, there is serious risks of introducing drugs into\nthe system. If the woman has uterine cancer, it's a\nserious problem of not trying to get the child out as\nquickly as possible. If you have preeclampsia or\neclampsia, where you're in a situation where the woman\nwill be dead in five minutes or 10 minutes, there could\nbe such a situation. The doctor thinks only one thing:\nGet it out as fast as possible. All right.\nNow, I know there are doctors who think the\ncontrary. There's lots of testimony of the doctors who\nthink roughly along the lines I've taken. That was true\nin Stenberg as well. So I think the issue is not that\nyou don't have support -- you do -- but that the support\nis contraverted, and therefore, what do we do in that\ncase?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, let\nme take as a point of departure the specific risks that\nyou associated with the injection that induces fetal\ndemise, because if there isn't a significant risk to\nthat injection, then all the other benefits that are\nassociated with the D&X procedure don't matter because\nthey can perform the D&X procedure. Now if you look\nthrough the record on this point, I think you will not\nfind any testimony that supports a significant risk from\nthat injection. Yes, there are risks because there are\nrisks from any medical procedure, but the risks are not\nsignificant.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there a definition in\nthe law of significant risk, other than doctors saying,\nI've been trained to try to save life and I want to\nperform the safest possible way? Is there some legal\ndefinition of what's a small risk, a big risk, a giant\nrisk?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With all respect, I think\nif a single injection that doesn't take any particular\nrisk other than the fact that it's an injection, if that\ncounts as a significant risk, then we might as well\nstrike the word \"significant\" from the discussion in\nStenberg. And Then I think what you have is that it's\nvery clear that their position is one of zero tolerance\nfor any marginal risk to maternal health.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, my question is the\nsame as Justice Breyer's. Is there anything in the\nliterature, including medical literature, that talks\nabout significant or minor risks? I mean, you fill out\nforms when you go to the dentist about risks. Now,\nif -- if the chance of death is one out of 100, is that\nsignificant? I mean, I don't know.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, it's a very\ndifficult question to evaluate in the abstract, Justice\nKennedy. And I think it actually, that question,\nthough, has direct bearing on this case, because\nCongress after all found that there was some risks with\nthe D&X procedure. The most prominent one that I would\npoint to is the risk of cervical incompetence because\nthe D&X procedure does -- it does require additional\ndilation, which can be associated with risks of losing\nfuture pregnancies. And that was born out, although not\nat a level of statistical significance, in the Chasen\nstudy by a plaintiff practitioner, where 2 of the 17\nwomen who had the D&X procedure and were available for\nfollow-up care had an early pre-term pregnancy in the\nfollow-up.\nSo I think those risks are born out in the\nonly study that's available. And I think the question\nbecomes, now, if D&X were some life-saving procedure for\nsomething that there was no other known cure for, you\nmight think, well, those are the risks you run. But\nwhen there remains available the D&E procedure, which\nhas been well tested and works every single time as a\nway to terminate the pregnancy, then I think risks that,\nif you were talking about a life-saving treatment for\nsome life-threatening condition with no known cure,\nthose risks might not be significant in that context.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but there is a risk\nif the uterine wall is compromised by cancer or some\nforms of preeclampsia and it's very thin, there's a risk\nof being punctured.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: There is a risk, Justice\nKennedy, but I think that, first of all, that even in\nthose limited circumstances, that the marginal risk\nbetween the D&X procedure and the D&E procedure are\nreally as far as I can tell nonexistent. Even in that\ncondition, unless there's some reason not to put the\ninjection in, if the doctor really thought the D&X\nprocedure was the way to go, he could begin, as\nDr. Carhart does in every single case after the 17th\nweek and start off with a digoxin injection or potassium\nchloride injection, induce fetal demise, and he has\nnothing to worry about from this statute.\nAnd I think the very fact that they are\nattributing significant risks to a single injection\nshows that at bottom their position is a zero tolerance\nposition. And that's a legitimate position, I suppose,\nbut it's completely inconsistent with this Court's\nprecedence, most notably the Casey decision. Because if\nall you needed to do is point to some marginal risk,\nthen this Court should have struck down the 24-hour\nwaiting period in the Casey decision, because the\nplaintiffs there said the 24-hour waiting condition has\nimposed significant risks. They were backed in that\npoint by an amicus brief by ACOG. But this Court didn't\nsay, well, you know, you're right, there's marginal\nrisks, we're going to apply a zero tolerance rule.\nThis Court instead upheld the 24-hour\nperiod, even though it required overruling Akron I's\ncontrary decision and this Court pointed, of course, to\nAkron I as an exemplar of the pre-Casey decisions that\nput too little weight on the legitimate countervailing\ninterest that the government has in this area.\nAnd so with respect, I think that the\nargument they are making is effectively an argument for\nreturning to Akron I and Thornburgh, where the rule of\nlaw was that there would be no interference between a\ndoctor and the doctor's patient and the doctor's best\njudgment as to how to treat the patient. This Court of\ncourse consciously moved away from that in Casey and\nexpressly repudiated the language in Akron I and\nThornburgh to that effect.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I follow up on a\nquestion the Chief Justice asked you during the last\nargument? We got into the government's construction of\nthe statute to narrow it to intentional situations.\nWould you explain a little more exactly what situations\nyou would exclude and what you would include in your\ninterpretation of the statute?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, justice Stevens, let\nme answer it this way and maybe if you want me to take\nyou specifically to the text, I can do that. But I\nthink the bottom line would be that under our view of\nthe statute, the most important thing is for those\ndoctors, like Dr. Cranen or Dr. Vivicar, who try to do\nthe D&E procedure every time, and they succeed 99 or 100\npercent of the time. Well, in the 1 percent of the\ncases where they inadvertently deliver the fetus past\nthe anatomical landmark, we would say they are not\ncovered by the statute because they would not satisfy\nwhat is really a compound mens rea requirement in the\nstatute, which requires that the delivery of the fetus\nbe intentional and deliberate and for the purpose of\ncommitting the overt act of killing fetus. And in those\ncases, of course, the intent of the doctor performing\nthe D&E isn't to deliver the fetus at all; it's to\ndeliver a fetal arm or a fetal leg as part of the\ndismemberment procedure. So they would not be covered\nby the mens rea requirement of the statute.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you measure the mens\nrea at the outset of the procedure when they begin the\ndilation a day or two before the actual operation is\nperformed, or is it at the time of beginning the\noperation?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think you could measure\nit from either time point. I think the better view is\nactually that it would be measured from the beginning of\nthe surgical operation, though the evidence of their\nintent at the beginning of the dilation would be very,\nvery relevant. The reason I would say that is I think\nif somebody tries to dilate and then gets an extreme\namount of dilation at the point they start the\nprocedure, I think the intent of Congress would still be\nfor them to do a dismemberment procedure at that point,\nrather than an intact removal.\nBut if this Court thought that the\nconstitutional line mattered on the answer to that, then\nyou could start from the beginning of the dilation\nbecause I think in fairness the differences between the\ntwo procedures are probably most manifest in the\ndilation regimen. I also think, though, the record\nsupports the notion that there are differences even once\nyou begin the procedure as to how you manipulate the\nfetus. I mean, Dr. Chasen for example, who is trying to\ndo the intact removal, says that after he has one leg\nremoved he effectively tries to reach back up and swing\nthe second leg across so he can remove the entire fetal\nbody. If you're -- obviously if you're performing a\ndismemberment D&E you're not trying to swing the second\nleg across; you're simply continuing to pull or twist on\nthe first extremity that prevents itself.\nSo I think there are differences even at the\nprocedural level. So I think that it would probably be\nmost consistent with Congress's intent to measure it\nfrom the beginning of the surgical part of the\nprocedure. But if you, as I say, in order to save the\nstatute, I think it's amenable to the contrary\ninterpretatio.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think you're wrong about\n-- you're probably wrong about this. But just before\nyou leave, I mean, this is why it's so hard for me to\nget into the medical procedure. I heard you as saying,\nperhaps wrongly, that well, the doctor can always use a\nlethal injection to kill the fetus. All right? That\nrang a bell. So I look up and see what the lower courts\nsaid about that and what they said is that nearly\neveryone agrees it is not always possible to kill the\nfetus by injection.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Oh, but can I respond to\nthat specifically?\nJUSTICE BREYER: He says It is not always\npossible -- what?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Can I respond to that\nspecifically?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, he then goes; he\ntells you why. He says there is a Dr. Knorr who says\nyou can't do it when the woman has a prior surgery,\npelvic inflammatory disease. And then another one says\nthey are not considered appropriate candidates because\nof medical illness or cardiovascular disease, etcetera.\nSo there's a list of medical situations where they\ncouldn't use a fetal injection.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Breyer, if I could\nrespond to that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I mean, there are certain\nsituations where the injection is contraindicated. I\nthink they'd be relatively rare situations. And I\nthink, you know, you could imagine I suppose that the\nstatute might pose a problem if you could identify\nparticular conditions where a D&X was particularly\nuseful, and those were also situations where an\ninjection would be contraindicated. I think, you know,\nthe universe of that may be zero, it may be one in a\nmillion; I don't know, but it's very small.\nAnother point that's made in the record\nwhich I think is important is they suggest well, you\nknow, maybe, maybe if you can't do the injection into\nthe heart of the fetus, then you're only going to be\nsuccessful something like 92 percent of the times. I\nthink though for purposes of the mens rea requirement\nwould certainly take care of any concern that the\nphysician would have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's bothering me, why I'm\nusing this as an illustration is that there are so many\nof these things. Of course there are special cases. We\nare only talking about a few, rare special cases. And\nas soon as you tell me that what's supposed to happen is\nthat the judges are supposed to start deciding whether\nthis is one of these unusual cases or not, rather than\nrelying upon significant medical opinion, as this doctor\nis now illustrating, I don't see how it's going to work.\nAt least I don't see how it's going to work without some\npeople suffering serious illness as a result of mistakes\nby the judge.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Breyer, I wish we\nwere talking about just a few rare cases because I think\nif we were, there would be, the statute would be\namenable to not being applied in those rare cases. But\nthis is one thing that I think my colleagues on the\nother side of the podium will agree with me on, is that\ntheir doctors don't think that this is a safer procedure\nin rare cases. They think it's a safer procedure every\nsingle time. And that's why doctors like Dr. Chasen and\nDr. Frederickson try to do the D&X procedure every\nsingle time, and they don't do it because they are\nindifferent to health, I suppose. In their best\njudgment they think that's the better way to go.\nAnd it's just a question ultimately of\nwhether you're going to defer to individual doctors'\njudgments, even when it's very much of a minority\njudgment; I mean anything you want to say about this\nprocedure it is the heterodox procedure, not the\northodoxy. Most ob-gyns are going to do the D&E\nprocedure, not the D&X procedure. Even in the Nebraska\ncase three of the four plaintiffs don't try to do the\nintact removal, so I think that just gives you, just a,\nknow you, anecdotal observation that you are talking\nabout the rare procedure, the heterodox procedure.\nAnd so the question is when you have a\nperfectly safe alternative, and you have some doctors\nwho like to do is it a different way, can Congress\ncountermand the doctors' judgment or do the doctors get\nthe final word?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the doctor has the\nintent, the good faith intent to perform a standard in\nutero D&E, and he knows because of what's happened in\nthe last three months, with women with this particular\nshaped fetus and particular position of the fetus, that\nthe chances are 50 percent, 60 percent that it's going\nto be an intact delivery, at which point he is presented\nwith the problem.\nDoes he have the prohibitive intent?\nBecause aren't you, don't you have an intent to commit\nthe, most likely consequences of your acts?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think so. I mean\nthat might be a situation -- I don't know that that's a\nrealistic hypothetical, I mean, let me just say that.\nIf that turned out to be a realistic hypothetical, that\nmight be an example of where this question I talked\nabout with Justice Stevens might matter. Which is in\nthat case it might matter whether or not the intent was\nmeasured --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's important to\nme because you seem to think that there is a standard\nD&E. In reading the medical testimony it seemed to me\nthat D&Es ought to result in result in intact deliveries\nquite without the intent of the doctor. Now maybe\nthat's wrong.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice\nKennedy, I don't think that's born out in this record,\nit's the other way, which is doctors who want to perform\na D&X, often, in a majority of the cases end up\nperforming a D&E. But the doctors that set out to\nperform a D&E, in Dr. Vibhakar's case she says a hundred\npercent of the time, she ends up with dismemberment.\nDr. Creinen says it's 99% of the time that he ends up\nwith dismemberment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I gather your\nsubmission is that we can tell who is setting out to\nperform which, by the dilation protocol. Those were the\nrecord references that you gave earlier?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Yes. And you can, you\ncan, you can tell you can tell from the fact that a\ndoctor, like one of the plaintiffs in the Nebraska case,\nDr. Fitzhugh, says, that, well, I don't do the intact\nremoval because if I wanted to do that I would have to\ndo a second round of dilation with a second round of\nlaminarias. And of course, that second round of\nlaminaria is also a medical procedure. Like the\ninjection, every medical procedure has some risks, risks\nof infection. If you looked at Dr. Creinen's testimony,\nthis is at 174 A to 177 A in the Eighth Circuit petition\nappendix, he says that he doesn't like to do a second\nround of laminaria dilation because it's painful to the\npatient. And that's his testimony.\nSo there are countervailing indications\nhere. And as I say, this idea of trying to prohibit a\npractice that involves further dilation is not an\nirrelevant concern from a health standpoint, because one\nof the things that Congress heard was that there were\nrisks to future pregnancies from cervical incompetence.\nAnd that's a particularly important concern because\nfirst of all, the plaintiff's experts aren't in a very\ngood position to evaluate that risk because they provide\nabortion services, not follow-up services. So they're\nnot in a good position to judge that risk.\nSecond of all, the only study we have here\npoints out that there is a greater incidence of that\npreterm delivery in the group that had a D&X procedure.\nNow again they say, they are going to come up and say\nwell it's not statistically significant. But the\nnumbers I think are striking. They had 17 women in the\ngroup that had a D&X and came back. Two of them had a\npreterm pregnancy. The D&E group was much larger, 45,\nand two of them had a preterm delivery. Now I think as\na commonsense manner, if you know that you were going to\nbe in a room with 17 people where two people were going\nto have something bad happen to them, or in a room with\n45 and two -- bad things were going to happen to two, I\nknow which room I'd like to be in. And all I'm pointing\nout --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, once you're making a\npoint of that study, I think it was also the case that\nthe ones that had the intact were older or rather\nfurther along in pregnancy; isn't that true?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Therefore the risks were\ngreater.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well if I could just --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And therefore since the\nrisks were greater, the other side says that this\nactually shows it was safer. I mean, I don't know how\nto evaluate that.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think it's even more\ncomplicated than that, Justice Breyer, because in fact,\nyou're right that the D&X patients were at a further\ngestational age, but the D&E patients were actually\nolder. And so I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I missed that.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Right. But it happens\nthat, the D&E patients were on average two years older,\nwhich I think also would be associated with greater\nrisk. So I think it's a wash. But I still think the\nChasen study net is quite helpful to our side. For one\nthing, this is a study put together by one of the\nplaintiff practitioners, a plaintiff in the Southern\nDistrict case, based on a study of his own practice.\nAnd of course one of the intuitions about the D&X\nprocedure is because you remove it intact it's going to\nbe a faster procedure and there is going to be less\nblood loss.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Clement --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, what did he find\nwhen he studied that? It was exactly the same for those\ntwo procedures. I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBERG: Because your time is\nrunning out I did want to ask you about a feature of\nthis legislation that hasn't come up so far, and that is\nperhaps stimulated by Stenberg. But up until now, all\nregulation on access to abortion has been state\nregulation and this measure is saying to the states,\nlike it or not, the Federal Government is going to ban a\nparticular practice and we are going to take away the\nchoice from the states, in an area where up until now\nit's, it's been open to the states to make those\ndecisions. How should that weigh in this case? And it\nis something new.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I mean I don't think\nit should figure in this Court's decision. I mean\nprincipally because the other side in neither case makes\na challenge based on the Commerce Clause, and I suppose\nthere is two reasons for that. That legal reason that\nthey don't bring the challenge is because there is a\njurisdictional element that I think would address the\nchallenges as a doctrinal matter. The practical reason\nI think is because this isn't the only instance in which\nthe Federal Government has gotten involved to address\nissues related to the abortion context.\nJUSTICE GINSBERG: Well I know, when it is a\nquestion of funding --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well but also access to\nclinics, in the the face act, which is also --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The bes example where\ngovernment has gotten involved in overriding what the\nstates want to do is Casey. It seems rather odd for\nthis Court to be concerned about stepping on the toes of\nthe states.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well -- it's certainly\ntrue that abortion has been dealt with at a Federal\nlevel one way or another since 1973. So I think that's\nalso part of the backdrop, but I also think, I mean, you\nknow, the Federal Government gets involved in this\nissue, you know, depending on your perspective, for good\nor for harm. It's there to protect access to the\nabortion clinics --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Clement, That\nbrings up a question I was intending to ask you. I\nnotice the finding says nothing about interstate\ncommerce but the statute says any physician who in or\naffecting interstate commerce performs the procedures.\nDoes that mean that the procedure is performed in a free\nclinic, as opposed to a profit organization, it would\nnot be covered?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, I don't\nthink we have taken, the Federal Government hasn't taken\na definitive position on that. I think it could be\ninterpreted either way. I think my understanding is the\nface context, a free clinic would be covered. There's\nnot a jurisdictional element in the face statute. So\nthere may be differences as, in application.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But how could the Commerce\nClause justify application to a free clinic? I don't\nunderstand.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think by, I mean,\nyou know, the Court's precedents in other areas has\nsuggested it's just not a matter of whether the ultimate\nservice is provided in commerce but in order to get the\nservices they have to take --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Activities that --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Yes. Exactly. I don't, I\nmean, that hasn't been briefed up in this case. If it\nhad been we'd probably have a definitive position one\nway or another. But I don't think the constitutionality\nin this facial challenge where that hasn't been a\nfeature of the challenge turns on the answer to that\nquestion one way or another.\nI think in regards to the Chasen study the\nlast thing I would say about it though is that it's\nimportant because most of the arguments on the other\nside are intuitive arguments. They are intuitive\narguments, that they would be less passive, so that will\nbe more safe. And what I think is telling is that the\nsame intuition would lead to the notion that it would be\nquicker and there will be less blood loss. And when\nthat was actually tested in a controlled study, it\nturned out not to be the case.\nThe last thing I'll say about the Chasen\nstudy is there was this indication that the two most\nserious complications were associated with the D&E\nprocedure. But one thing that I think is important to\nunderstand about the Chasen study is it is a\nretrospective study of Dr. Chasen and his partner's own\npractice. Now what they do in every case is they set\nout to perform a D&X procedure, and so what they are\nstudying and what they call the D&X procedures, that\ncohort are the times when they tried to do a D&X\nprocedure and they were successful.\nThe D&X cohort from this study, is you know,\nare those circumstances where he and his partner tried\nto do a D&X procedure, weren't successful and did a D&E\nprocedure.\nNow why is that significant? Because it\nshows as Chasen noted in his article that in those\nsituations that were D&Es and they were associated with\nserious complications there was nothing he could have\ndone about it. He could have performed a D&X, he tried\nto perform a D&X and it wasn't successful, so he ended\nup performing a D&E. And so I really think on balance\nthe Chasen study ends up supporting our position,\nbecause the first time you have any kind of controlled\nstudy what you find is that some of the intuition turns\nout not to be true, and the safety benefits from these\nare a wash, and the one sort of loose end from the study\nis the threat that you do see from the greater dilation.\nNow it's not statistically robust, but I think that it\ndoes bear out one of Congress's concerns.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Could you address the\nquestion I asked respondent's counsel in the last case\nabout the availability of other facilities? Because\nthere are alternate methods but some of these require\nhospitalization, and my understanding is the hospitals\naren't always open.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Right, I -- I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So it doesn't make much\nsense to say well, there is an alternate procedure if\nyou can't be admitted to the facility.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Sure. And as I tried to\nindicate in rebuttal, that's really not a concern\nbecause, the difference is whether some clinics will\nonly offer the D&X and the D&E and will say that\nbasically you've got to go to a hospital to get the\ninduction procedure. But that doesn't really, I don't\nthink matter, because the point is anybody could can got\na D&X who is at a clinic can also get a D&E. In every\nsingle case the doctor that can perform the D&X can also\noffer the D&E. And since the D&E is what the district\ncourt in the Nebraska case described as the gold\nstandard of Casey, I think every woman in every case is\ngoing to have that option of a safe, of a safe pregnancy\noption. And again one way to illustrate that is Chasen.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But then you pin your\nwhole case on the availability of D&E even though D&Es\nsometimes inadvertently turn into intact D&Es.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, but, Justice\nKennedy, I think we have our answer to that, which is\nthe best reading of the statute requires the intent at\nthe outset of the procedure, and therefore nobody -- in\nthe 99 percent of the cases that Dr. Crainer sets out to\nperforms a D&E and succeeds, there's no issue in the\nworld because everybody would look at that and say\nthat's a D&E. In the one case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How do you do that, because\nI looked at that part of the statute and, comparing it\nwith the statute in Cathcart, the relevant part forbid a\ndoctor from doing this for the purpose of performing an\nabortion that the doctor knows will kill the fetus.\nThat's the language basically, right. And in this one\nit says you can't deliver past the fetal trunk for the\npurpose of performing an overt act that the doctor knows\nwill kill the fetus. So I look at those two sets of\nwords. I mean, I've simplified them slightly, but I\ndon't see the difference.\nSo if the one in Cathcart is viewed as too\nvague, why is the other one here not too vague?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, it's\nbecause of the addition of the anatomical landmark\nlanguage to the Federal statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'll grant you that\nin respect -- if what Cathcart was worried about I guess\nwas you didn't know what the words \"significant\nsubstantial portion of the child,\" that tends to be\ncured. But if what Cathcart was worried about was the\nfact that a doctor who sets out to perform a D&E will,\nmaking a pass, think he'll have the fetus dismembered\nand, lo and behold, it doesn't dismember, so the bottom\nportion of the fetus descends outside the womb. And\nthere he is and now what happens? If that's the\nconcern, then I guess you'd agree that that same concern\nexists here.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, only with the\ncaveat, though, is that I think this Court really didn't\nhave to confront the second concern because it had the\nfirst concern. And if you thought that a leg, which\nthis Court did, was a substantial portion, and that was\nthe, that was the act that induced fetal demise, either\nway it was covered no matter what your purpose was,\nbecause the doctor's purpose in removing the leg was to\ninduce fetal demise.\nHere the compound mens rea requirement works\nwith the anatomical landmark language, so that what you\nneed to satisfy the statute is the deliberate and\npurposeful intent to remove the fetus past the navel\nwith the purpose of performing an overt act that will,\nwill lead to fetal demise, which is not covered when you\ndon't even have the intent to take it out of the -- past\nthe anatomical landmark in the first place and you're\ntrying to do something that's going to take place in\nutero.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time\nfor rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General\nClement.\nMiss Gartner.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EVE C. GARTNER\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMS. GARTNER: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn Casey, this Court reaffirmed that the\ngovernment cannot ban pre-viability abortions. Despite\nCasey, Stenberg suggested that there is a narrow\ncategory of pre-viability abortions, intact D&Es, as\nthis Court understood that term in Stenberg, that can be\nbanned so long as the ban contains a health exception.\nBut I'd like to leave the health exception question\naside for a minute and turn to the scope of the law that\nCongress has enacted here.\nThe question is whether Congress can enact a\npre-viability abortion ban that does not track the\nhallmark of intact D&E abortions as this Court\nunderstood that term in Stenberg and by doing so to ban\na substantially greater array of abortions than would be\nbanned had the law faithfully tracked the language in\nthe Stenberg opinions about what constitutes an intact\nD&E. And I'm referring both to the majority opinion in\nStenberg and in the dissents.\nIt is our position that this Court must\nreject Congress's effort to exploit the limited license\nthat this Court seemingly granted in Stenberg because to\nallow such an expansion of pre- viability abortions that\ncan be banned would set the stage for continued\nlegislative efforts to ban other iterations of the\nclassic D&E method of abortion until truly there would\nbe nothing left at all of Casey's holding that it is\nunconstitutional to ban pre- viability second trimester\nabortions.\nThe government in this case has conceded\nthat the act bans more abortions than merely the intact\nD&E as this Court understood it in Stenberg. But I want\nto highlight for the Court how the language of this act\ndeparts from the hallmarks of intact D&E and how these\ndepartures place doctors at risk of prosecution for the\nvery facet of D&E abortions, and by that I mean all D&E\nabortions, that enhance their safety.\nThere is three respects in which the act\ndeparts from the hallmarks of intact D&E as understood\nin Stenberg. First, the act does not require breach\nextraction of an intact fetus to the head, one of the\nprimary hallmarks that this Court understood in\nStenberg. Instead, the act applies once the fetus is\nextracted past the navel, a far more frequent occurrence\nthan extraction to the head. And in fact the government\nin its briefing both in their initial brief and in their\nreply concedes that in any of what the government calls\nstandard D&Es a living fetus can be extracted past the\nfetal navel before demise occurs.\nIn addition, the act does not require the\nfetus to be delivered intact at the end of the\nprocedure, another component of what is considered to be\na hallmark of intact D&E in Stenberg.\nIn fact, the word intact appears nowhere in\nthe statute and again the government concedes that some\nnon-intact D&Es would violate this law as drafted. In\nfact, the government contends that one of the\n\"advantages,\" in its words, is that the law would ban\nmore than intact D&E. And finally, the act does not\nrequire that the fetus be extracted in a breach\npresentation at all, even though in Stenberg the Court\nthought of the breach extraction as one of the hallmarks\nof intact D&E.\nNow this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- I think\nthis question was asked earlier, but I want your\nposition. How often does the vertex delivery occur in a\nD&X procedure? I --\nMS. GARTNER: Your Honor, two, two doctors\nin particular, Dr. Chasen and Dr. Hammond, testified\nthat they have used in their practice the vertex\npresentation to treat women who, as Ms. Smith indicated,\nthe fetus suffered from a serious lethal anomaly that\ninvolved a greatly distended abdomen. The fetus\npresented in a head-first presentation. The head\ndelivered through the dilated cervix, but the only way\nto complete the procedure was to reduce the size of the,\nof the abdomen that was, that was anomalous in size\nbecause of the underlying fetal condition.\nIn those cases, those doctors testified that\nthat was absolutely the safest way to terminate the\npregnancy for the woman. The only alternative way would\nhave been abdominal surgery, which, which all the,\nvirtually all of the doctors, even the government's\ndoctors, agreed carries far greater risks for the woman\nthan a vaginal surgical abortion.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Miss Gartner, with regard\nto your argument that the statute here did not track\nwhat you have described as the characteristics, the\nhallmarks, I think the answer from the other side is\nthat the, the theory of this statute is a theory of a\nclear line between a legitimate abortion and\ninfanticide. And if that is the theory, then whether\nit's a breach delivery or a non-breach delivery is\nirrelevant. What would your answer be to that?\nMS. GARTNER: Well, two answers, Your Honor.\nFirst of all, the clear line that this Court drew in\nStenberg was essentially the line at intact delivery to\nthe head followed by an act that results in fetal\ndemise. Very clearly what this Court understood in\nStenberg could -- was, was an intact D&E and several\nmembers of the court suggested that that would be\nconstitutional to ban.\nIn addition, the government today seems to\nsuggest --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we said that that\nwould be an appropriate line. But the question here is\nis it really essential to an appropriate line that we\ntalk, that we describe it as a, as a breach delivery or\na non-breach delivery.\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, I would agree that\nof the three hallmarks that the Court recognized in\nStenberg, the breach delivery is probably the least, the\nleast central; that the other two hallmarks, the\nextraction to the head followed by a completely intact\ndelivery after demise, were absolutely the hallmarks\nthat everyone on this Court understood in Stenberg, and\nthose, those lines, are nowhere in the statute that\nCongress enacted.\nToday General Clement seems to be arguing\nthat there is a different line that's protected in this\nstatute, a different line than the Court recognized in\nStenberg, and the line is about where the fetus is when\ndemise occurs. But, but this Court in Stenberg\nunderstood that even in a classical D&E, a standard D&E,\nas the government calls it, part of the fetus is outside\nthe woman's uterus when fetal demise occurs. The Court\nrecognized that fetal demise occurs even in a standard\nD&E when, after a part of the fetus is drawn out of the\nwomen's uterus, resistance is met, disarticulation\noccurs, and after that fetal demise. So even in a\nstandard D&E the line that the government today is\noffering up, the line of inside or outside the uterus,\nwould be violated in any D&E --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understood the\nstatute here to apply only when the, in the words of the\nstatute, that the partially delivered infant is killed\nafter passing the anatomical landmark.\nMS. GARTNER: Well, that's right, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we just say your\nhypothetical about extraction of the leg it seems to be\nwould not be covered by the statute.\nMS. GARTNER: Absolutely, Your Honor, that's\nright. But what I'm saying is that some part of the\nfetus, no matter what, is outside the women's uterus,\nwhether it's an intact D&E, a non-intact D&E --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But we don't talk about a\nleg dying. We talk about the fetus dying, I think, and\nI think that's not the leg.\nMS. GARTNER: I think the important point is\nthat the government acknowledges that in a standard D&E,\nwhat it calls standard D&Es, the fetus can be extracted\npast the anatomical landmark. So the anatomical\nlandmark isn't a bright-line decision between intact\nD&Es and non-intact D&Es. But in Stenberg this Court\ndrew that line between intact D&Es and non-intact D&Es.\nIt suggested --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where does the\ngovernment concede that in a standard D&E the living\nfetus is extracted past the anatomical landmark?\nMS. GARTNER: It does so --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought that was\n-- I thought their position was that that was not the\nstandard D&E.\nMS. GARTNER: Right. It does so in two\nplaces, Your Honor. On page 32 of their initial brief\nthey refer to, they describe two circumstances that they\nsay or two parts of the law that they say saved the law\nfrom banning non- intact D&Es. The first is the\nanatomical landmark and the second is the requirement of\nan overt act. They describe the overt act as saving\nnon-intact D&Es that were not already excluded from the\nanatomical landmark requirement. So that suggests that\nthere are some standard D&Es that would not be saved by\nthe anatomical landmark requirement.\nIn addition, in their reply brief on page 22\nthey explicitly say that the fetus is usually not\ndelivered past the anatomic landmark in the standard\nD&E, but they don't say that that never occurs. So they\ndo admit that that sometimes is the case, and in fact\nthe government witness, doctor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought their\nanswer on that was that sometimes the D&E procedure will\nlead to a D&X procedure, but that the requirement of\ndeliberately and intentionally removes those situations\nfrom the scope of the statute.\nMS. GARTNER: Well, I think that's not how I\nunderstood it, Your Honor. But in addition, the\ngovernment witnesses, witness, Dr. Sadigian, admitted\nthat in any standard D&E the fetus can be extracted past\nthe navel, the anatomic landmark of the navel, of the\nnaval, even in a standard.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Prior to demise?\nMS. GARTNER: That's right, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you understand the\ngovernment's argument or answer to that to be, well, if\nthe intent did not exist, if there was not an intent to\ndo that, then the doctor is not liable?\nMS. GARTNER: Well, Your Honor, I think this\ngets to the point I was going to make about the safety\nof doing abortions in a way that would be banned by the\nlaw, and that's that in every D&E, regardless of whether\nthe intent is to do an intact D&E or not an intact D&E,\nthe intent is to minimize the insertion of instruments\ninto the uterus and to extract the fetus as intact as\npossible, because each insertion of the instruments\nincreases the risk of causing harm to the woman's\nuterus. And so in every D&E, regardless of whether the\nphysician expects to have an intact fetus at the very\nend of the procedure, they do want to minimize the --\nthe amount of instrumentation and bring it out in as few\nparts as possible and so there is a deliberate and\nintentional delivery of the fetus as far as possible\nwhich often can be past the navel, though in most cases\nit won't be up to the head. So that's why the line that\nthis Court drew in Stenberg is the line that first of\nall delineates between two distinct procedures: intact\nD&E and nonintact D&E. The difference between those two\nprocedures is whether the fetus is extracted to the head\nor not to the head before demise occurs. This, this\nstatute doesn't draw that line. It draws a different\nline and in doing that, it captures far more abortions\nthan the other law would and, and the key thing is that\nif this law stands with the past the navel line the\ninevitable result is that doctors in order to try to\navoid the reach of this statute will have to stop trying\nto minimize the instrumentation and stop trying to draw\nthe fetus out as intact as possible because often when\nthat happens --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My concern with your\nargument is it's not just the anatomical line. The\nstatute, I guess the Solicitor General referred to this\nas the multiple mens rea requirement. It's not simply\nthe extraction to a particular anatomical landmark but\nwith the purpose of demise at that point. So, if in the\ntypical D&E the demise is going to be accomplished\nbefore extraction passed the anatomical landmark. It\nwouldn't be covered by this law.\nMS. GARTNER: Well, Your Honor, I guess to\nsome extent it comes down to what intent means but if\nwhat it means that the doctors would prefer, would like\nit to come out as far as possible before they have to\ntake any, any kind of action to clear an obstructing\npart, that's, that's what they intend.\nThe doctor only uses disarticulation when\nit's necessary to clear an obstruction because the\ncontinued extraction --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the\nSolicitor General's reference with respect to the\ndiffering protocols on dilation which suggests a\ndifferent intent going into the procedure for the D&E\nand D&X?\nMS. GARTNER: Well, two points, Your Honor.\nOne is the statute makes no mention of dilation\nprotocols even though some group like the American\nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists when they\nintend to define an intact D&E abortion they've defined\nit specifically by reference to dilation protocols. And\nsome state statutes have also used dilation protocols as\npart of the definition of intact D&E but this statute\nmakes no mention of dilation protocols.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the dilation\nprotocol certainly would be relevant on the question of\nintent which this statute does refer to, wouldn't it?\nMS. GARTNER: I think it would be relevant,\nYour Honor, but I think it's not -- it really can't be\ndispositive of the physician's intent be --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Because?\nMS. GARTNER: Some doctors use a one day\nprotocol, some doctors use a two day protocol but that\nin of itself isn't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you're telling us that\nsome do this and some do that and the question is why\nwouldn't following one protocol rather than another\nprotocol very significant evidence of what was intended?\nMS. GARTNER: Because some doctors use a two\nday protocol, Your Honor, even if they don't expect to\nget an intact D&E. There is not a direct correlation,\nthere's some correlation between the amount of dilation\nand the percentage of times that a physician achieves\nintact D&E. To some extent doctors also use other\nagents to dilate, they use misoprostol and medication.\nThat even if they're doing a one day protocol --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do we have any indication\nin your case about the effective safety of any other\naspect of this procedure if these doctors would change\ntheir, their method of operation and go to a one-day\nprotocol?\nMS. SMITH: In terms, one-day protocol?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMS. GARTNER: Some doctors -- I think one\nthing is that doctors perform abortions most safely when\nthey do them in a way that they are most accustomed do.\nThey are doing them the way they were trained to do\nthem.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't want to cut your\nanswer but I want to know whether there is anything\nspecifically in the record in your case that bears on my\nquestion.\nMS. GARTNER: There is nothing specific\nabout doctors changing protocols. There is significant\nevidence about increased risks if doctors were to stop\ntrying to extract the fetus as intact as possible.\nSeveral witnesses, including several government\nwitnesses have agreed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you mean start and stop\nwith a different intent?\nMS. GARTNER: That's right, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: As opposed to adopting a\ncompletely different procedure entirely -- a different\nprotocol entirely.\nMS. GARTNER: Well, no actually even the\nother government witness, Dr. Cook, agreed that -- and\nthe other government witness, Dr. Lockwood, agreed that\nremoving the fetus as intact as possible in any D&E is\nthe safest way to perform a D&E procedure regardless of\nwhether the intent was to do an intact D&E procedure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: For such a doctor, a doctor\nwho thinks that I'm trying to remove in this emergency\nsituation as much of the fetus as possible as quickly as\npossible, would such a doctor often, never, sometimes be\nthinking what I think is likely to happen here, I'll\nmake a pass at the fetus, try to draw it out, and what's\nmost likely to happen is that the trunk, a lot of it\nwill come out and then the head of the fetus will\ndismember, after a lot of the trunk comes out.\nIs that --\nMS. GARTNER: I would say it certainly is\nnot never and it's not always. It's somewhere in\nbetween but I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if a doctor is being\nhonest about that, is there any way that such a doctor\ncould escape the language of the statute on the\ngovernment's interpretation?\nMS. GARTNER: I think not Your Honor because\nthe intent is to extract the fetus as intact as\npossible. In a good many cases it will be extracted\npast the navel though not to the head. So the doctor\nfalls within the deliberately and intentionally language\nand I don't think, the government also proffers the idea\nof specific intent, but again because this statute\ndoesn't track the actual differences between the two\nprocedures, the having the specific intent doesn't save\nthe statute. The doctor may intend to perform the\nabortion as defined in this law but not intend to do an\nintact D&E and that was the testimony in these cases.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you clear up one\nthing for me? You say it's always the doctor's intent\nto extract as much as possible before causing fetal\ndemise. I thought there was significant number of cases\nin which there was a deliberate decision to cause fetal\ndemise before I start any extraction?\nMS. GARTNER: Well, Your Honor there is\ntestimony in our case, in the California case, that a\nfew doctors that testified said the beginning at\napproximately 22 weeks of pregnancy, they offered women\nthe option of undergoing a fetal demise injection before\nthe procedure began. But the testimony was also\noverwhelming, including from the government witnesses,\nthat that injection procedure carries significant risks\nfor some women. For example, women with either\nsusceptibility to infection, like women with HIV or\nhepatitis, you definitely don't want to do an additional\ninjection. That in addition --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: From the point of view of\nthe doctor it would be the safest thing to avoid\ncriminal responsibility.\nMS. GARTNER: It -- but the problem is as\nthe district court, found it's an unnecessary medical\nprocedure that subjects the woman to additional risk.\nNow if the doctors --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why would the\ndoctors in that case propose that option to their\npatients?\nMS. GARTNER: At 22 weeks and later, as the\nabortion is getting closer to the viability line, the\ndoctors feel that some women would feel more -- it's for\npsychological reasons for the woman. That's why it's an\noffer; it's not a requirement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what -- what\nare the psychological reasons?\nMS. GARTNER: If she would prefer that the\nfetus undergo demise before the extraction begins, some\nwomen may feel better about that. The testimony was\nalso that other women absolutely don't want that. And\nyou know, feel that they -- you know, it's a very\npersonal question that really goes to the heart of this\ncase. It's a very personal decision how the woman who\nhas made this very difficult moral/religious decision to\nend her pregnancy, often for very tragic reasons, how\ndoes she want the fetus to undergo demise? Different\npeople will have different views about this. But here\nCongress has legislated that for the woman and done so\npre-viability, when the state interests really are\ninsufficient to require the woman to undergo a procedure\nthat is not marginally safer but significantly safer for\nher.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well is there a\ndifference between, in your view, in the\nconstitutionality, marginally safer and significantly\nsafer? In other words, I take it we don't, you\nobviously were here for the discussion in the prior\ncase. We don't have evidence on marginal significant.\nAnd do you think it matters; if in fact it's a marginal\ndifference in safety, does that, is that still enough to\noverride Congress's interests in this case?\nMS. GARTNER: Yes, Your Honor, it does\nmatter. Marginal safety would not be enough but I think\nwhat is important is that you assess, you assess the\nquestion of marginal versus significant by looking at\nthe averted harms. It's not a question of quantifying\nhow many women would avert the harms.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, do we just\nlook at the averted harms, or -- or do we, or Congress,\nalso look at the incidence of the averted harms? Is it\na theoretical -- is it a theoretical inquiry or is it to\nsome extent a quantified inquiry?\nMS. GARTNER: Well, Your Honor, I think it\ncan't be a quantified, quantified inquiry. Ultimately\nthis Court has never looked at the constitutional\nquestion of when an abortion statute interferes with a\nwoman's health to an extent that it's unconstitutional,\nin terms of how many women are affected. The question\nis, is how seriously would a woman be affected if she\naffected? And the evidence here is overwhelming.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Doesn't the answer to my\nquestion turn largely on the age of the fetus? Isn't it\na vast difference between the kind of decision the\nmother that is to make if it's a 14 week fetus on the\none hand and 26 week fetus on the other?\nMS. GARTNER: Well, I'm not sure if that's.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: For example, one of the\ncongressional interests described in the finding is\navoiding fetal pain to the fetus. And I guess they\ndon't suffer any pain prior to 20 weeks but after 20\nweeks there is some risk of pain. And that seems to me,\nthat could affect a calculus very dramatically for the\nwoman making the decision.\nMS. GARTNER: For the woman, but I think the\nimportant point, Your Honor, is that this, that the\nintact D&E procedure, and the testimony was overwhelming\nto this effect, that -- in some cases this procedure\naverts catastrophic health consequences for the woman.\nIt averts uterine perforation, it averts the spread of\nsepsis or infection; it averts the spread of --\npotentially the spread of malignant cancer throughout\nthe women's body.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- if the woman\ncan take into account the impact on the fetus at a\ncertain point in time, and your option, as you said some\nphysicians give, of fetal demise prior to the procedure,\nwhy is that beyond the scope of things that Congress can\ntake into account?\nMS. GARTNER: Because what Congress has done\nhere is take away from women the option of what may be\nthe safest procedure for her. This Court has never\nrecognized a state interest that was sufficient to trump\nthe woman's interest in her health. If the woman and\nher doctor together agree that proceeding in this way is\ngoing to avert significant health risks to her, and the\ntestimony here is overwhelming that there are situations\nwhere that occurs, this Court has never recognized a\nstate interest that was sufficient to trump that woman's\nparamount interest in her health.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but we have -- we\nhave said that that judgment has to reflect some kind of\nsubstantial medical judgment. It can't be an\nidiosyncratic determination by one doctor alone.\nMS. GARTNER: Absolutely, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So to that extent --\nMS. GARTNER: And that's -- and I take that\n-- and maybe that was my -- and I take this as a given\nhere. Given the overwhelming testimony from doctors\nfrom the American College of Obstetricians and\nGynecologists, and this Court's holding in Stenberg,\nwhere the record was less robust, that we have that\nsubstantial medical authority here. And given that\nsubstantial medical authority, doctors need to be able\nto use their appropriate medical judgment, in the words\nof Roe and Casey, to provide this procedure for their\npatients when in their judgment -- not in their\nunfettered discretion, but in their sound clinical\nexperience and medical judgment it's going to be the\nsafest for her and avert catastrophic health\nconsequences.\nSo this is -- again, it may be that the\nnumber of women is not large, but for the women who are\naffected the impact of this ban is undoubtedly\nsignificant.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't want to\nmisinterpret the Attorney General, the Solicitor\nGeneral's remarks but he indicated in those case there\ncould be an as applied challenge.\nMS. GARTNER: Well, I think, Justice\nKennedy, you answered that question as well as I could.\nIf a woman had to wait until she needed a banned\nabortion for her health, and file a proceeding wait for\nthe court to grant relief, undoubtedly she would not get\nthe relief she needed in time.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the answer that the\nSolicitor gave -- General gave to that was, you could\nhave a pre-enforcement proceeding. That you can back up\nthe clock.\nMS. GARTNER: Right. I'm not sure that I\nactually understood his answers though, because I think\nthat that's what we have here, in fact, is a\npre-enforcement proceeding to, to determine that this\nlaw blanketly banned intact D&E abortions even when the\ndoctor believes it's, it would have significant health\nbenefits for the patient.\nSo this is not, I want to go back to,\nbecause my light is on, Stenberg suggested that there\nwas a line that could constitutionally be drawn between\nbanned, between permissibly banned procedures and, and\nprocedures that have constitutional protection. But the\nstatute didn't draw the line and it didn't draw that\nline in two ways. This, this statute defiantly rejected\nthis Court's view that because there is substantial\nmedical authority for the proposition that intact D&E is\nsometimes safer, a health exception is absolutely needed\nhere, and they also refused to draw the line at what\nthis Court understood was the defining difference\nbetween intact D&E and nonintact D&E.\nIn the Solicitor General's reply brief they\ntalk about the promise of Stenberg. Well, the promise\nof Stenberg was absolutely betrayed by Congress in this\ncase in both respects, both in terms of preserving the\nhealth of the woman and allowing her to use what a\nsubstantial medical authority thinks is the safest\nprocedure for the woman, and in terms of holding the\nline at a limited ban on pre-viability abortions given\nthat Casey recognized that women have a constitutional\nright to choose to end their pregnancy pre-viability.\nI was going to address briefly some of the\nconcerns that the Solicitor General offered about some\nof the health risks of intact D&E and cervical\nincompetence. Just briefly. The, all of the government\nwitnesses in this case agreed that the congressional\nfindings completely overstate any risks of intact --\nthere is no, there is no reasonable basis to conclude\nthat intact D&E puts a woman at any greater risk of harm\nthan standard D&E, and in fact the evidence is quite to\nthe contrary. It averts catastrophic health\nconsequences in some circumstances. There is no strong\nevidence that intact D&E has any impact on cervical\nincompetence.\nThe Solicitor General talks at length about\nthe two cases in Dr. Jason's study, but both of those\nwomen who experienced cervical incompetence had, in\nfuture pregnancy, had had cervical incompetence in prior\npregnancies, and that's a condition that tends to stay\nwith the woman. So there is no reason to think that it\nwas the intact D&E itself that caused cervical\nincompetence in the subsequent pregnancies because of\nintact D&E.\nAnd finally, yes, it's true that Dr. Chasen\nused intact D&E or attempted to use intact D&E in all\ncases, and the women who had D&Es, three of them\nsuffered very serious medical consequences after having\na D&E. The Solicitor General says well, Dr. Chasen tried\nto do intact and he failed so, so there was really\nnothing to say about this law. But the fact is, if this\nlaw went into effect, no woman could have intact D&E. So\neven though, even in those cases where Dr. Chasen was\nable to do intact D&E, he would no longer be able to do\nthat. So the incidence of those women having\ncatastrophic health consequences, which in the Chasen\nstudy, three of the women having D&Es had catastrophic\nhealth consequences. Inevitably if this law is upheld,\nan intact D&E is not available as an option to doctors\nwhen in their judgment based on substantial medical\nauthority, it's the best option for the woman.\nInevitably there will be more and more women having D&Es\nand suffering catastrophic health consequences in\nsituations where if intact D&E had been available, those\ncatastrophic consequences could have been averted.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Gartner.\nMS. GARTNER: Thank you for your\nconsideration, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General Clement, you\nhave three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nA few final points. First of all, I don't\nthink the constitutionality of Congress's act depends on\nwhether the anatomical landmark is the navel or up to\nthe head. Congress, as everyone recognizes, had to draw\na line. I think drawing the line at more than halfway\nout is a pretty good place to draw the line.\nSecond, my learned co-counsel is certainly\ncorrect. This is a pre-enforcement challenge, in\nresponse to your question, Justice Kennedy. But the\npoint is, this is a pre-enforcement spatial challenge,\nand if the Court rejects it and allows this statute to\ngo into operation, it will not foreclose the possibility\nof a future pre-enforcement as applied challenge that\nfocuses on particular medical conditions. That's not\nsomething, though, that one can reach in this record,\nbecause as the district court in this case found at\n147a, there is no specific condition here in which the\nD&X procedure is particularly ready met for or otherwise\nis medically necessary. Rather, the claims in this case\nare that it's always better. That's what some doctors\nsay. It's a heterodox position, it's not the majority\nposition, but it's not focussed on specific situations.\nThe other thing it's not focused on, and\nthis is in reference to something that Justice Breyer\nmentioned, it's not focused on emergencies. Another\nthing that the district court noted at page 128a of its\nopinion is that the D&E procedure and the D&X procedure,\nneither of them are particularly good in dealing with\ntrue medical emergencies where time is of the essence,\nbecause both these procedures require substantial\nadvance time to do the dilation. And since the D&X\nprocedure requires more dilation, I actually think in an\nemergency, you'd probably end up performing the D&E\nprocedure if you performed either one, because you'd\nneed less time for the dilation in an emergency.\nThe other thing I should point out is that,\nof course, there is this question about what's a\nsignificant risk. And one thing about the lethal\ninjection at the beginning of the process, the Digoxin\ninjection, is the other side concedes that the mother\ngets to make the choice as to whether or not to do that\nprocedure. Well, Dr. Carhart does it as a matter of\ncourse after 17 weeks, and I certainly don't think\nanyone would suggest that Dr. Carhart is needlessly\ninflicting significant risks on his patients after 17\nweeks by following that regimen in every case after 17\nweeks.\nAnd I think it's worth noting that the legal\nregime that respondents would construct is a legal\nregime where the woman can decide whether or not to have\nthat shot, Dr. Carhart can decide it for her and that's\nokay, but Congress can't make this judgment. But it's\nimportant to draw a line here, and say that fetal demise\nthat takes place in utero is one thing. That is\nabortion as it has always been understood. But this\nprocedure, the banned procedure is something different.\nThis is not about fetal demise in utero. This is\nsomething that is far too close to infanticide for\nsociety to tolerate. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General\n"
