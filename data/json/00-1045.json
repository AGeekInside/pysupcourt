        "content": "(11:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 00-1045, TRW, Inc. v. Adelaide Andrews.\nMr. Nager.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. NAGER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIn this case, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit held that the statute of limitations on a claim of\nimproper disclosure under the Fair Credit Reporting Act\ndoes not commence until the plaintiff discovers her\ninjury, as opposed to the -- the date of the improper\ndisclosure.\nIn doing so, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit did not parse the language of the statute of\nlimitations that is in the Fair Credit Reporting Act, but\nrather said that language was not sufficiently expressed\nto overcome a presumption in favor of a discovery rule\nthat the Ninth Circuit held is read into that statute and\nall Federal statutes.\nQUESTION: When did the injury occur here to the\nrespondent?\nMR. NAGER: The -- the injury for each alleged\nimproper disclosure would have occurred on the date of the\nalleged improper disclosure, Justice O'Connor, although\nsome of the damages --\nQUESTION: Disclosure to who? I mean, when --\nwhen exactly did the injury --\nMR. NAGER: Well, there were four allegedly\nimproper disclosures at issue in this case. The first was\nin July of 1994, and when that disclosure was made, it\nrevealed --\nQUESTION: Disclosure to some third party.\nMR. NAGER: To the third party. And the first\none here was to a bank.\nQUESTION: And -- and the person injured may\nnever know about it.\nMR. NAGER: They -- they might not know about\nit, although the -- the way these reporting systems work,\nif they ever actually apply for credit themselves and\nthey're denied, they will automatically know about it,\nwhich of course is what happened to the respondent in this\ncase. She didn't know about the --\nQUESTION: But it -- it's a 2-year statute of\nlimitations.\nMR. NAGER: That's correct, and the statute\nexpressly states that the action must be filed within 2\nyears of the date upon which liability arises.\nQUESTION: Is this the type of statute that --\nthat depends largely on private enforcement to implement\nit?\nMR. NAGER: It does have private causes of\naction. The Federal Trade Commission, of course, also has\nauthority to enforce the statute through cease and desist\norders, through civil penalties --\nQUESTION: But in general, I think you would\nlook at this as one that envisions private enforcement.\nMR. NAGER: Absolutely, Justice O'Connor. We\ndon't dispute that.\nBut what is does envision is private enforcement\nwithin 2 years of the date of disclosures. That's what\nthe statute expressly says on its face. It says the\naction can be brought, but if it's going to be brought, it\nhas to be brought within 2 years from the date upon which\nliability arises. And in plain English, as well as under\nthe terms of this statute, if there is liability, it\narises upon the date of the improper disclosure.\nWe know that in plain English, the term arise\nmeans come into existence, originate. And we know under\nthis statute, section 616 and 617, which specify what a\ndefendant's liability can be, the statute equates\nliability with a failure of a defendant to comply with a\nrequirement of the section.\nQUESTION: What about the argument that the\nplaintiff isn't harmed -- the plaintiff may not be harmed\nby the disclosure? So, there may have been a violation of\nthe statute, but no claim for damages, because nothing bad\nhas happened to the plaintiff. So, you have to wait until\nsomething bad happens to the plaintiff.\nMR. NAGER: I don't think that's what the\nstatute says, Justice Ginsburg. The statute says that\nliability arises upon an improper disclosure.\nQUESTION: Liability for what, if you're not\ndamaged?\nMR. NAGER: Well, in this case, the plaintiff\nsought injunctive relief, punitive damages, and actual\ndamages, as well as, if they prevailed at trial, for\nattorney's fees.\nQUESTION: Can you get nominative -- a --\nnominal damages and punitive damages?\nMR. NAGER: Well, it's unclear under statute\nwhether you can get nominal damages. Certainly the\nstatute expressly states that in the case of an alleged,\nwillful violation of the statute, which is what the\nplaintiff in this case alleged, you can get punitive\ndamages. And the case law also allows for a plaintiff to\nseek injunctive relief.\nLet me clarify what the injury is, Justice\nGinsburg. Maybe this will assist both you and Justice\nO'Connor.\nWhat this statute does is -- the credit\nreporting companies have computer databases that compile\ninformation about credit reporting histories of\nindividuals. And it makes that database available to\nsubscribers, banks, insurance companies, and the like.\nAnd a creditor can go onto that database, just like your\nlaw clerks can go on Westlaw, and pull off information.\nAnd when they pull that information off, if there weren't\nreasonable procedures in place to prevent them from\nimproperly pulling information off, that would be an\nimproper disclosure, which would injure the person because\nit would invade their privacy and reveal confidential\ninformation about themselves. Under State law, they\npossibly would have a claim for invasion of privacy, or if\nthere was inaccurate information in the database, for\ndefamation of character.\nWhat this statute did was it created a Federal\nright against improper disclosure in the absence of\nreasonable procedures of people's credit history.\nQUESTION: Just out of curiosity, what -- what\nare the statute of limitations applicable to State actions\nfor, let's say, trade liable I suppose? Somebody gives\nout inaccurate information about -- about the financial\nstanding of a particular person or company.\nMR. NAGER: I don't know --\nQUESTION: How do the statutes run? Do they --\nMR. NAGER: I don't --\nQUESTION: -- normally run from -- from the date\nof the liable or from the date that -- that the person\nfinds out about it?\nMR. NAGER: At the time of enactment of this\nstatute, the -- the statutes of limitations of which I'm\naware of at State law, ran from the date of the -- of the\ndisclosure, not from the date of discovery. That was\ntypical in the 1969-1970 time frame for invasion of\nprivacy claims and for defamation claims.\nAnd we also know that this statute is one of six\ntitles of the Consumer Credit Protection act, and we know\nthat each of the statutes of limitations in those other\nfive titles run from the date of alleged violation.\nQUESTION: We would have been sure about that if\nthe language in the initial bill, which was the date of\nthe occurrence of the violation -- if that language had\nbeen used. Since Congress chose not to use that language,\nwhich would have been clear, it seems to me that the\nphrase that they did use, when liability arises, is\nambiguous.\nMR. NAGER: Well, I understand the -- the point,\nJustice Ginsburg, but let me make the case for why that's\nnot a correct conclusion to draw from the premise.\nIt obviously would have been simpler if they had\nused the language from the date of violation, but they\nused a phrase that means the same thing. And when they\nmade the change --\nQUESTION: How do we know it means the same\nthing?\nMR. NAGER: We know it means the same thing\nbecause every time this Court has had a case that has used\nthe term arise, it has said that means the date upon which\nthe event happens, not the date upon which someone\ndiscovers it later.\nAnd we know in section 616 and 617 of this\nstatute that liability is defined by reference to the acts\nof the defendant.\nAnd we also know that there is an explicit\nexception in section 618, the statute of limitations\nprovision, which does expressly refer to a discovery rule,\nbut it says the discovery rule is applied in the case of a\nwillful and material misrepresentation of a disclosure\nrequired by the statute. And the strong implication from\nthe inclusion of an express reference to the discovery\nrule and the exception is that the general rule doesn't\ninclude a discovery.\nQUESTION: Well, our previous cases haven't\nlooked at when liability arises.\nMR. NAGER: You're absolutely right.\nQUESTION: There's some other noun before the\narise.\nMR. NAGER: The -- the other cases that the\nCourt have said cause of action arises.\nQUESTION: Do you think anything turns on that?\nMR. NAGER: No, I don't. And I -- I would point\nyou to the Court's decision in the Bay Area Laundry case,\nwhich was dealing with the Multi-Employer Pension Plan\nAmendments Act. That statute, like that statute, although\nit used the phrase, cause of action arise, had a 6-year\nlimitation period from the date the cause of action arose\nor, alternatively, 3 years from the date of discovery of\nthe cause of action. And this Court, looking at the\nprimary statute of limitations provision, said that\nreflects the standard rule of statute of limitations law,\nthat the statute of limitations commences when the cause\nof action is complete, not upon discovery.\nQUESTION: Let -- let me ask you. The case is a\nlittle bit difficult because we're not quite sure of -- of\nthe boundaries and dimensions of the negligence cause of\naction that was alleged here. And I assume you're, of\ncourse, contesting liability.\nI -- I take it you -- you do concede you must\nconcede, because of the statute, that there is a general\nduty on the part of the reporting agencies and TRW not to\nbe negligent in the performance of its statutory\nobligation.\nMR. NAGER: Yes.\nQUESTION: So, we can, I guess, then consider\nthe case based on a supposed cause of action where there\nis negligence and there is injury.\nMR. NAGER: Yes, Justice --\nQUESTION: Even though in this case, I'm -- I'm\nsure you would contest it. You would say there was no\nnegligence.\nMR. NAGER: That is correct. The Court can also\nassume, since these are the allegations in this case, for\npurposes of considering this issue, you could consider\nthat the failure to maintain procedures was in fact\nintentional because they've, in fact, proceeded under the\n-- under the provision of the statute which prohibits\nintentional noncompliance with the statute because they've\nalleged a right to punitive damages and an intentional\nnoncompliance with the Ninth Circuit remanding this case\nto the -- to the trial courts. The claim is not barred by\nthe statute of limitations, and they should have the right\nto proceed on their allegations, including their claim for\npunitive damages. So, you could consider under either\nsection of the statute.\nWe would say, as they themselves conceded in\ntheir briefs to the Ninth Circuit, they said Mrs. Andrews\nwas per se damaged when her privacy was invaded by the\ndisclosures. Now, they've made an actual damages argument\nin this Court. That's not the argument they were making\nin the court below. What they were saying in the court\nbelow is what would be assumed from their complaint and\nwould have been assumed in any action at common law where\nsomeone was alleging invasion of privacy or defamation,\nthat their injury occurred upon the date of the alleged\nimproper disclosure, although they may have suffered some\nadditional damages or more damages or all of their damages\nat a later point in time.\nQUESTION: But you're saying in that respect\nit's just like common law defamation. The minute the --\nthe defamatory statement is out, your -- your injury is --\nis complete for purposes of a cause of action.\nMR. NAGER: For purposes --\nQUESTION: That's your only point there.\nMR. NAGER: That is correct.\nLet -- let me move for a second and -- and\nexplain why the Ninth Circuit's importation of a discovery\nrule into this statutory scheme makes little sense.\nIt's in the nature of this statutory scheme and\nthe subject matter that it's dealing with that the claims\nthat this statute can give rise to become stale very\nquickly. The reason is, is all of the information that's\ncritical to presenting one of those claims is not in the\nhands of the plaintiff. It's either in our computer\ndatabase or in the records of the creditors who in the\ncrediting reporting agencies give the information to.\nAnd that's why when Congress passed this\nstatute, it said that there were going to be certain\ndisclosures that it was going to require either the credit\nreporting agencies to make or the creditors to make. But\nit also specified, because of concerns about the burdens\nof record keeping, quite finite periods of time by which\nthose records would have to be kept. So, at the time the\nstatute was passed, a credit reporting agency only had to\nkeep a list of who a disclosure was made to for 6 months,\nand now, as amended in 1996, they only have to keep it for\na year.\nAnd at the time the statute was passed, there\nwas no requirement placed upon a subscriber to our\ndatabase, one of the creditors, for any time period they\nhad to keep their own records. Now, in 1976, the Equal\nCredit Opportunity Act was passed, and the Federal Reserve\nBoard promulgated regulations requiring that a creditor\nkeep records of any action it takes to deny credit for up\nto 25 months.\nBut the fact of the matter is, because of -- of\nthe enormous amounts of information that are retained, the\nrecord retention policies of credit reporting agencies and\ncreditors, pursuant to guidance received from the Federal\nReserve Board and the Federal Trade Commission -- record\nretention -- we -- we get rid of those records at the end\nof 2 years as a credit reporting agency, and the banks get\nrid of them after 25 months. So, the claims --\nQUESTION: I don't understand. You mean if I\napply for credit and TRW checks me out, they're only\ninterested in the last 2 years?\nMR. NAGER: The underlying credit information is\npreserved, as long as it's not negative, forever. If it's\nnegative, the statute prohibits the credit reporting\nagencies for retaining it for more than 7 months.\nBut remember what the -- the claim is is an\nimproper disclosure. So, what you have to know is, is who\nwas the information disclosed to and when. And this --\nthe -- that's a separate data field. And under the\nstatute, that list has to only be maintained for a year\nafter 1996 by the credit reporting agency. So, the only\nway to find out that a disclosure has been made is either\nwithin a year -- or we actually keep it for 2 years\nbecause, in the case of an employment application, you\nhave to keep it for 2 years, or from the creditor, and\nthey only keep it for 25 months.\nWhat that means is, is that claims that aren't\ndiscovered within 2 years that would be preserved under\nthis statute -- the underlying records that would -- would\nreliably prove whether a disclosure has been made and\ncontained an inaccuracy won't exist.\nQUESTION: Well, but if we affirmed the Ninth\nCircuit, you might change your policies, might you not?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. NAGER: No. As a matter of fact, Mr. Chief\nJustice, I don't think we would. And the reason we\nwouldn't is -- for example, California has already, under\nits State consumer code, changed its statute of\nlimitations to be a discovery rule, but the credit\nreporting agencies haven't changed.\nAnd the reason is we -- we have no desire to\nfacilitate the bringing of causes of action. And I'm\ngoing to be honest -- candid with the Court about it. And\nthe information is expensive to retain. So --\nQUESTION: How many other States have changed\nthe way California has?\nMR. NAGER: I don't know the answer to that\nquestion, Justice Ginsburg. I do know from my client and\npartners who practice in this area regularly that their\nimpression is no State has a statute of limitations that\nis longer -- I'm sorry. No -- no State has a record\nkeeping requirement that exceeds the Federal record\nkeeping requirement.\nQUESTION: But one of the arguments you make, if\nI remember correctly, was the Ninth Circuit is -- is a\nlarge area, so we -- whatever they say is going to govern\nfor the Nation because we can't keep our books one way for\nCalifornia and another way for someplace else. But\nCalifornia is a pretty large State. If -- if you're\nsaying, well, California has done it, it doesn't bother\nus, we go our merry way, why wouldn't you do the same\nthing under the Ninth Circuit's decision?\nMR. NAGER: Well, we would go -- in response to\nthe Chief Justice's question, as long as the Federal law\nor State law doesn't require us to keep the records any\nlonger than the present 1-year requirement, we're not\ngoing to keep the records for any longer --\nQUESTION: So, then this -- this -- whether it's\na discovery rule or whether from the date of the violation\ndoesn't matter, as far as your record keeping is --\nMR. NAGER: As far as the record keeping. What\nI would suggest is it would leave the courts and our\nclients -- to the extent that claims are asserted after\nthe records are gone, it will be left -- we will be left\ndefending against claims that are based upon quite\nunreliable evidence, and the courts will be left\nadjudicating claims that are based upon quite unreliable\nevidence because the underlying documents won't exist.\nAnd the reason that I would like to make that\npoint to the Court, Justice Ginsburg, is because the very\nmost fundamental purpose of a statute of repose -- of the\nrepose aspect of a statute of limitations is to prevent\nsociety and its courts from being burdened with claims\nthat can't be reliably proved. And --\nQUESTION: But that's an argument that you\nreally save those records; you shouldn't throw them away.\nMR. NAGER: No, I don't think so, Justice\nStevens, because no one disputes in this case what\nCongress contemplated in the record keeping requirements.\nAnd my point to the Court --\nQUESTION: No, but I'm talking about your\nexposure to State cause of action where they have a\ndiscovery rule that your exposure runs beyond the 2 years.\nMR. NAGER: The -- the --\nQUESTION: And it seems to me you would have an\ninterest in keeping records that would disprove\nunmeritorious claims.\nMR. NAGER: Well, the -- the -- I think the\nanswer to that is -- is no.\nQUESTION: Except that they would also prove\nmeritorious claims.\nMR. NAGER: That's -- that's true.\nQUESTION: Well, that's right, and the question\nis which -- which is the greater number.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. NAGER: And I think the -- the -- I can't\ntell you that I have actual empirical information, and my\nclient would tell you that the number of inaccurate\ndisclosures is de minimis relative to the number of\naccurate, proper disclosures. That's why we maintain\nreasonable procedures.\nBut I can tell you this -- and I think this is\nthe issue in this case -- is -- how long did Congress\ncontemplate that we would keep those records for, and what\nstatute of limitations did Congress correlate with those\nrecord keeping requirements? Because when asking what\ncould Congress have intended through this statute of\nlimitations rule, when it only said that we had to keep\nthe records for 6 months in 1970 and for a year in 1996,\nit couldn't possibly have been contemplating that it would\ncreate a statute of limitations that would produce\nunreliable claims for the court, that the more -- much\nmore --\nQUESTION: But the statute of limitations I\nthought was 2 years.\nMR. NAGER: The statute -- yes because the --\nQUESTION: So, that's more than 7 months or a\nyear.\nMR. NAGER: It understandably gives the\nplaintiff some time to commence their lawsuit.\nQUESTION: Even though you can say, we don't\nhave the records after whatever is -- the -- the time\nperiods -- the statute of limitations is longer than the\nrequired record keeping.\nMR. NAGER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: But there's nothing that prevents you\nfrom keeping the records.\nMR. NAGER: Nothing other than lots of expense.\nQUESTION: Do we -- we do have a Federal agency\nin this picture, the FTC. They know something about\ncredit. Do we owe them any kind of respect?\nMR. NAGER: I -- I think the answer is you\nplainly do not owe them deference in the Chevron sense\nbecause they don't have rulemaking power and they're not\nthe only agency charged with that administration of this\nstatute. And I don't think that you owe them Skidmore\nlevel respect because the fact of the matter is the first\ntime they've articulated this position is in their brief\nin this case. They don't address the language of the\nstatute other than to say, well, other words in other\nstatutes have been -- haven't foreclosed the importation\nof a discovery rule, and so perhaps it would be\nappropriate for the Court to import one here.\nAnd we would suggest to the Court that the\nlanguage of this statute is very clear. It may not be\nperfectly clear, Justice Ginsburg, but the phrase,\nliability arise, has a plain English meaning, which\ncorresponds very naturally with the liability provisions\nof section 616 and -- and section 617.\nAnd the overwhelmingly strong negative\nimplication of the misrepresentation exception, which has\nan express reference to a discovery rule -- and as you\nnoted, Justice Ginsburg, both the Senate and the House\nbills had a date of violation language. And the\nconference committee report, which changed that language\nand added the misrepresentation exception, commented that\nits action was taken only for the purpose of adding the\nmisrepresentation exception, not for changing the\nunderlying meaning of the basic statute of limitations --\nQUESTION: And -- and the -- at common law, as I\nrecall, I think under California statute in defamation\nactions, the statute began to arise from the date of the\nstatement, from the date of the defamation.\nMR. NAGER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And I assume that one rationale for\nthat was because if the injured party doesn't discover the\nstatement for -- for 2 or 3 years, it's necessarily\ndiminished and any remediation is minor. Is -- is -- and\nassume that is the rationale.\nDoes that apply to you or not? Does -- does the\nfact that the erroneous credit information was given 2 or\n3 years ago in most cases diminish its -- its injurious\nnature?\nMR. NAGER: I think that in some --\nQUESTION: I'm not sure I can say that. I'm --\nI'm just trying to think --\nMR. NAGER: With respect to just a pure improper\ndisclosure, it may. I'm not sure I know the answer to the\nquestion.\nWhat I can say -- and I think this may not\nanswer your question, but I think it's important for you\nto know -- is that if a case of identity theft has\noccurred here, the -- our individual consumer who isn't\naware of the disclosure -- they will find out. They may\nnot find out in a month. They may not find out in 6\nmonths, but once the -- a report is issued in a false --\nto -- to a person who isn't the consumer, if -- if the\nconsumer later applies for credit and they're denied\ncredit, they have to be told by the creditor that denies\nthem credit why they're denying them credit and where they\ngot the consumer credit report from, and then they can go\ncheck on our database as to what actually is on the\ndatabase.\nQUESTION: But I take it what's implicit in your\nargument is that if they are not given notice that they\nhave been denied credit within 2 years, chances are not\nvery great that they're going to get that notice after 2\nyears. Isn't that --\nMR. NAGER: No, no. They may because they may\nnot apply for credit within 2 years.\nQUESTION: Well, I know. But in terms of\nprobabilities, isn't -- I -- I thought that's what you\nwere assuming.\nMR. NAGER: No, no. What I'm -- what I'm\nsuggesting to the Court is that there are improper\ndisclosures that might not be discovered within 2 years.\nBut if there is a disclosure which adversely impacts an\nindividual's credit rating and their desire to obtain\ncredit, they will find out about the fact that their\ncredit has been impaired when they do apply for credit,\nwhether it's within the 2-year period or not. Now, they\nwon't know, because the records won't exist any longer,\nwho that credit information -- what other creditors that\n-- that information was given to, but the underlying data\nabout -- will be in the database about what their credit\nis and why their credit is being adversely impacted. That\n-- that was the point --\nQUESTION: Well, I know.\nBut going back to Justice Kennedy's question, I\nmean, you're saying that there certainly are going to be\ncases in which the 2 years will have passed and then\nspecific injury will arise.\nMR. NAGER: And they'll have a claim about that\nspecific injury if the specific injury is in year 3 I was\ndenied credit, because in order for that credit to be\ndenied, there's going to be a new credit report that's\nrequested. That will be a new disclosure, and if the new\nrequest for credit is denied because of something in the\ncredit record reflecting the -- the fact of earlier\nmultiple applications for credit that have been denied,\nthey have to be told that and they have to be told who\ngave it to them. That's what I'm saying.\nIf you look at the claims in this case, the two\nclaims that are subject to this Court's review right now\nare the oddball claims. They're the improper disclosure\nclaims, not the inaccuracy claims. There's no doubt the\nrespondent had a -- had the -- found out within the 2\nyears and thus had the ability to timely bring a claim\nabout when she was actually denied credit herself. That\nwas the point I was trying to make.\nQUESTION: What happens to a person, if you're\nright, who finds out 3 years -- 3 years later she's denied\ncredit, and the reason was because 3 years ago the company\nSears got a report that had all kinds of incorrect\ninformation in it or whatever? Is that person without any\nremedy totally?\nMR. NAGER: I'm not sure I --\nQUESTION: Well, happens is --\nMR. NAGER: She finds -- she finds --\nQUESTION: Let's suppose --\nMR. NAGER: When does she apply for credit?\nThat's --\nQUESTION: She -- in year 1 you do a credit\nreport. You have 19 things you're not supposed to\ndisclose: old arrest records, old bankruptcy records.\nYou do everything wrong. All right. You send it off to\nSears. She doesn't actually apply until year 8 to get\ncredit from Sears. Sears goes to its files, looks up this\nold report, says no credit. Now, does she have any remedy\nat all?\nMR. NAGER: If she applies in year 8, she'd have\na -- a remedy for the credit that she was denied in year\n8. She --\nQUESTION: She can sue who? She can sue you?\nMR. NAGER: She could sue the -- the credit\nreporting agency for inaccurately disclosing. If I'm\nunderstanding you correctly, there's a new report that's\nissued.\nQUESTION: The -- your -- your client deals with\nSears in year 1.\nQUESTION: He didn't say there was a new report.\nMR. NAGER: Oh, I'm -- I misunderstood. If\nthere's not --\nQUESTION: In year 1 and they never see Sears\nagain. In year 8, the credit is denied. Is there any\nremedy for the person who was denied the credit?\nMR. NAGER: In the absence of a willful\nmisrepresentation, not -- not under this statute.\nQUESTION: It's unlikely, of course, that Sears\nis going to be using an 8-year-old report without asking\nagain, and you'd probably give the same information again.\nMR. NAGER: It's almost inconceivable that they\nwouldn't ask again, and it's also probably slightly less\ninconceivable but still relatively inconceivable they\nwould still have the records because it's in their\ninterest and I'm sure they have the record retention\npolicies to abandon them as well.\nThank you, Justice Scalia.\nLet me move quickly to the presumption that the\ncourt of appeals applied. It's -- it's wrong and it's\nwrong for two reasons.\nFirst, insofar as they --\nQUESTION: What -- precisely what presumption is\nit you're talking about?\nMR. NAGER: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. The\nNinth Circuit in this case said that in the absence of an\nexpress statement by Congress, it would imply a discovery\nrule into this statute -- into this statute irrespective\nof the particular words this statute chose to use. And so\nthere's a basic -- there are two aspects to the Ninth\nCircuit's ruling. One is that a default rule will be a\ndiscovery rule, and secondly, that they'll apply that\ndefault rule in every case under every Federal statute\nunless the statute expressly refers to discovery for the\nbasic statute of limitations rule.\nWith -- with respect to the -- their clear\nstatement rule, this -- neither this Court nor any other\ncourt of appeals that I'm aware of has equated a statute\nof limitations with a retroactive law with a waiver of\nsovereign immunity, or with any of the areas of law in\nAnglo-American jurisprudence where this Court has said\nthat it will require a specifically clear statement from\nCongress in order to accept the proposition that Congress\nhad a particular intent.\nAll of the courts of appeals that have embraced\na discovery rule as a default rule have said in the\nsilence of Congress, not in the ambiguity of Congress.\nQUESTION: So, you're not asking us to say, no,\nthere's no discovery rule. But what you're saying is you\ncan find Congress otherwise intent -- intended from\nsomething that's not an express negation.\nMR. NAGER: Our primary position in this case is\nthat this statute, when you look at the term, liability\narise, when -- when the Court looks at the\nmisrepresentation exception, when it looks at the\ndefinitions of liability in sections 616 and 617, the only\nreasonable construction of this statute is that the basic\nstatute of limitations rule is the traditional complete\ncause of action.\nQUESTION: But -- but all that the Court must do\nto hold in your favor is to say you've got an express\nmisrepresentation exception. Then that's it.\nMR. NAGER: That's correct.\nWe would also say if the Court chose to decide\nwhat kind of default rule should be applied in -- in this\n-- in this case or in Federal cases generally, that the\nNinth Circuit's opinion vastly overstates the support and\nauthority for using a discovery rule as a default rule.\nThis Court for 150 years at least has said that\nthe traditional rule is the complete cause of action rule.\nThis Court has made exceptions to the complete cause of\naction rule in the cases of fraud, in the case of the\nFederal Employer's Liability Act, and in -- in the context\nof medical malpractice claims in the Federal Torts Claims\nAct.\nBut both -- in Kubrick, dealing with the Federal\nTorts Claims Act, both the majority and the dissent in\nthat case said that the general rule is an injury rule,\nnot a discovery rule. And as Justice Stevens pointed out\nin his dissent, an injury rule would be the thing that\nmakes the most sense in the commercial context and the\ndebate in that case was simply about in the peculiar\ncontext of medical malpractice claims, what should the\ndiscovery -- the United States in that case didn't contest\nthat -- that a discovery rule shouldn't apply. And the\nquestion was what kind of discovery rule should apply.\nNow, it is true that a number of -- of courts of\nappeals -- and, Justice Ginsburg, when you were on the\nD.C. Circuit, you wrote one of the opinions -- said that\nin the late 1980's in the wake of Kubrick, a number of\nFederal courts of appeals had, in fact, adopted discovery\nrules as default rules in -- in statutory silence.\nI would suggest to you that -- that Congress has\nwritten reams of United States code against the\ntraditional rule, not against the discovery rule, that\nonce you enter into the debate -- into the notion of using\na discovery rule as a default rule, you run into exactly\nthe kinds of problems that the Court faced in Klehr and in\nRotella where then this is, well, which discovery rule do\nwe use now? Is it --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Nager.\nMR. NAGER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Mr. Henderson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW R. HENDERSON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HENDERSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nLooking at the statute at issue, there are two\nparts to it. The first part is the main part that\nprovides that under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the\n2-year limitation begins when liability arises.\nQUESTION: I -- it is quite correct for you to\nbegin with the statute, but just a carryover of the very\nlast point. The Ninth Circuit was wrong, wasn't it, when\nit said the general Federal rule is that a Federal statute\nof limitations begins to run when a party knows or has\nreason to know the injury? I mean, that's -- that's just\nnot the general Federal rule, is it?\nMR. HENDERSON: That -- that is the rule that's\nbeen adopted by many circuit courts of appeal around the\ncountry, in Cada and in the Connors case.\nQUESTION: Including the D.C. Circuit.\nMR. HENDERSON: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: But it's certainly not the rule of\nthis Court, is it?\nMR. HENDERSON: I don't know that it's the rule\nof this Court. That's what we're here to answer today in\npart.\nQUESTION: Well, it's not what we said in\nHolmberg. That was a much more limited case --\nMR. HENDERSON: Holmberg --\nQUESTION: -- than the Ninth Circuit gave it\ncredit for.\nMR. HENDERSON: That's correct, and I -- and I'm\nnot here to defend the articulation of the judgment by the\nNinth Circuit. I -- I believe that the judgment was\ncorrect, but for reasons that can be much better\nexplained.\nQUESTION: But I sidetracked you on the statute,\nand I think that is the right place to begin.\nMR. HENDERSON: Thank you.\nAnd there are the two parts. The first part is\nthe liability arises language, which generally applies\nThe second part is an estoppel provision, and a\nvery liberal one at that, in that it calls for a complete\nrenewal of the limitations period, not merely suspension,\nwhich is the normal rule at Federal law. So, it is a very\nliberal estoppel provision enacted by Congress that should\nin no way derogate the application of the normal\nprovision, the liability arises language.\nQUESTION: That to me is one of the hard parts\nof this case. It's not quite expressio unius, exclusio\nalterius, but it's close. And Congress did consider\nwhether or not the -- the rule that the statute begins\nwhen the injury arises ought to be modified and it did\nmodify it for a misrepresentation but not otherwise. And\nthat's, it seems to me, a very difficult problem for you\nto overcome.\nMR. HENDERSON: Well, Justice kennedy, I believe\nthat when you consider the misrepresentation exception,\nwhat -- what it is is it is a very additive provision that\nsays that if there is an intervening misrepresentation by\na credit reporting agency, during the running of a -- of a\nnormal limitations period, then there is complete renewal\nupon discovery of that intervening misrepresentation, not\nmerely suspension, which is the normal Federal rule, as\nthis Court has recognized, at least members of this Court\nhave recognized, for example, in Jordan Chardon v. Soto in\n1983 in the dissent. But the -- the fact that Congress\nwent out of its way to say if -- if this particular type\nof -- of egregious misconduct arises, which is not the\nnormal misconduct that the statute is meant to address,\nbut this particular new type of egregious misconduct\narises, then we're going to have a complete renewal when\nthat is discovered. That really is an --\nQUESTION: Where does this statute say this\nduring thing? It just -- you put a lot of words into it,\nbut all that it seems to say is that -- that if there's a\nmisrepresentation, the statute doesn't run. Period.\nMR. HENDERSON: No. It says that the -- that\nthe limitations period shall begin from and shall run from\n-- for 2 years from the discovery of the\nmisrepresentation.\nQUESTION: Why don't we take a look at it?\nWhere is this provision that --\nMR. HENDERSON: It's shown on page 1 of the blue\nbrief, for example. And it's -- it's a very long\nprovision that takes up the bulk of statute at issue.\nQUESTION: It does but still is an exception\nfrom the basic prohibition.\nMR. HENDERSON: It -- it uses the word except,\nbut it is clearly an additive provision that -- and the\nodd thing about this is that the four courts of appeals\nthat have misconstrued the statute in my view have looked\nat this and have said, that which is clearly additive\nshould be read so as to subtract from the main provision\nin -- in a substantial way. And it makes no sense that\nwhen Congress intended to simply add something, that is\nclearly for the benefit of consumers, and that provides 2\nfull years upon the discovery of an intervening deception,\nshould how -- somehow be read to truncate the normal\nprovision.\nQUESTION: Well, the reason that I think I'm\nhaving such difficulty with it is because on your theory,\nthe statute doesn't begin to run till discovery anyway.\nSo, you have to imagine a case where the only way -- the\nthing didn't begin till discovery. Then this proviso is\nsupposed to be doing some work? What could it be? I\nmean, it seems you have to think of very weird cases, very\nunusual cases before you could imagine a situation where\nthe proviso would serve any function at all on your\ntheory, which is it doesn't run till discovery anyway.\nMR. HENDERSON: Justice Breyer, they are\ndiscovery of two different things. Just as, for example,\nthe Seventh Circuit's Cada decision, which was written by\nJudge Posner, clearly makes a distinction between the\ninjury discovery rule, which is an accrual rule, and\nequitable estoppel, which -- which is used normally to\nsuspend the running of a statute of limitations after it\nhas begun, well, the injury accrual rule has to do with\nthe discovery of the injury commencing the limitations\nperiod. Equitable estoppel has to do with discovering the\ndeception or the wrongdoing on the part of the --\nQUESTION: That, of course, is true, but it's\nvery hard to see how a -- a deception could be a material\ndeception where the person is fully aware of the\nunderlying liability.\nMR. HENDERSON: Fully aware is correct.\nQUESTION: Well, and if he is not fully aware on\nyour theory, the underlying statute didn't begin to run.\nMR. HENDERSON: That -- I beg to differ, Justice\nBreyer. It's -- full awareness is the kind of full\nawareness that the dissent in Kubrick argued for, which is\nfull awareness of all the elements, including the breach\nof the duty. We do not argue that the breach of the duty\nneed be discovered --\nQUESTION: Strike full aware.\nMR. HENDERSON: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: I'm looking for the example on your\ntheory of the case and at the heart of the statute which\nhas to do primarily with two things. You've got to have\nreasonable procedures, et cetera, when you have your\nagency, and then in the few cases, comparatively, where\nsomebody wants the information about them, you have to\ngive it to them. Okay? That's basically what it's about.\nThat heartland of the statute on your theory --\nit's hard for me to find examples that would be\nsignificant in number where this proviso would be doing\nany work. Now, that's my problem, and you can respond to\nthat by giving me obvious examples where it would be.\nMR. HENDERSON: Gladly, Justice Breyer. The\nbest example would be the facts in this case, and I'll add\nsome facts to show you how the misrepresentation exception\nwould work. The facts in this case are that the\nplaintiff's privacy was breached four times between July\n1994 and January 1995, and she had no reason to know that\nuntil she went to apply for credit in the normal course of\nher business in May of 1995.\nNow, immediately upon --\nQUESTION: And had no cause of action before\nthen.\nMR. HENDERSON: She had no cause of action\nbecause she had not suffered any injury as a result of\nthese completely latent privacy breaches, and in fact, she\ncould have gone to her grave never knowing about them.\nBut because she went out and applied for credit,\nshe found out about them, and she immediately asked for\nand received her -- a consumer file disclosure from TRW,\nthe defendant.\nNow, TRW, the defendant in this case, did not\nmisrepresent any facts, did not, for example, conceal\nthose four privacy breaches. Had they done so, however,\nhad they sent back to here a letter, in which they had\nconcealed the four privacy breaches, then she would still\nbe perhaps -- well, she might not even be aware of the\ninjury at that time, but she would certainly -- the -- the\nmisrepresentation exception at that point in time would be\ninvoked if, in fact, the misrepresentation --\nQUESTION: But what you just swallowed -- the\nwords you just swallowed are my problem. If those\nmisrepresentations were material, then she wouldn't have\ndiscovered the underlying harm anyway. So, you wouldn't\nhave needed the proviso on your theory of the case.\nMR. HENDERSON: Well, there may be -- there may\nwell be other misrepresentations that could be made by a\ncredit reporting agency, however, that was -- that went to\nthe -- their -- that were material to their liability, and\nthe fact that -- that they might not --\nQUESTION: But those were the examples I was\nlooking for. You see? That -- you put your finger right\non where I'm having the problem.\nMR. HENDERSON: Well, perhaps they could give a\nmisrepresentation to the effect that the Federal\nGovernment requires us to use the procedures we use, and\nthey've been deemed reasonable by the Federal Government\nor in some other way reasonable --\nQUESTION: Mr. Henderson, you have, from I think\nyour answer to Justice Breyer, pretty well indicated that\nthere would be, even under your view, a large overlap\nwhere you'd never get to the misrepresentation exception\nbecause the claim never arose in your -- in your view of\nthe case. You stopped yourself in the middle of your\nanswer to him and gave an answer that suggested that the\nclaim wouldn't accrue anyway. So, you'd never get to the\nmisrepresentation exception. And -- and I think that a\nlot turns on that.\nSo, I would like you to give -- I have exactly\nthe problem that Justice Breyer has. I couldn't think of\nsomething that wouldn't be covered by your main rule,\nwhich is nothing -- no liability arises until the person\nsuffers the injury, knows that she's suffered the injury.\nNow, give me an example where she knows she suffered the\ninjury and would have the benefit of the misrepresentation\nexception.\nMR. HENDERSON: As I sit here, I'm trying to\ncome up with one, but I think that any misrepresentation\nby the credit reporting agency in response to a consumer\ndemand --\nQUESTION: But you had time when you wrote your\nbrief to think about this.\nMR. HENDERSON: yes.\nQUESTION: And if -- if the misrepresentation\nexception is superfluous on your reading of the statute,\nthat is a powerful reason for us not to agree with you.\nMR. HENDERSON: No, I don't believe it's at all\nsuperfluous any more than I believe equitable estoppel is\nsuperfluous from the injury discovery rule.\nQUESTION: Well, then give us a concrete example\nwhere it would have any work to do.\nMR. HENDERSON: Well, I -- I believe that, for\nexample, if a consumer were to inquire of a credit\nreporting agency saying give me everything in your file,\nwhich includes all the credit accounts, all the\ndisclosures for up to 2 years for employment purposes and\nlesser amount of time for other reasons, and if there was\nany disclosure in there or any representation in there by\nthe credit reporting agency that was intended to deceive\nthe -- the consumer about the -- about the extant\nliability, then it could be, for example, as I said, a --\na -- some message from the credit reporting agency saying\nthat we are -- we are required by law to have the\nprocedures we have or to do that which we did, which would\nbe a falsehood and intended to deceive the consumer from\nbringing a claim for -- for -- to determine whether or not\nthe procedures were, in fact, reasonable.\nQUESTION: Yes, but if there were anything wrong\nin what it disclosed to her, presumably the consumer would\nknow, and that would start the period running. And there\nwould be no need for the consumer to invoke the exception.\nMR. HENDERSON: How would the consumer know that\nthe misrepresentation is --\nQUESTION: Well, I assume it's a\nmisrepresentation about the consumer.\nMR. HENDERSON: It would be a misrepresentation\nabout the behind-the-scenes activity of the credit\nreporting agency.\nQUESTION: Well, if the -- if the behind-the-\nscenes activity of the credit reporting doesn't, in fact,\nresult in a misrepresentation about the consumer, where is\nthere going to be any cause of action ever at any time?\nProviso or no proviso.\nMR. HENDERSON: Are you talking about a\nmisrepresentation to a user of the credit report?\nQUESTION: A false -- false statement about the\nconsumer in a matter that would be material to a decision\nto extend credit to the consumer.\nMR. HENDERSON: I think you're confusing a\nmisrepresentation made to a user of a credit report from a\nmisrepresentation made to the consumer who inquires of a\ncredit reporting agency.\nQUESTION: But doesn't -- I guess what I was\nassuming was that when the consumer inquires, the consumer\nis told all those facts which are in the credit reporting\ncompany's file which bear on the consumer's credit\nworthiness which are the sorts of things that the -- that\nthe credit rating service discloses when a credit inquiry\nis made. Am I wrong about that?\nMR. HENDERSON: They should be the same given --\nexcept that there might be differences in time.\nQUESTION: Well, is there any reason to -- I\nmean, I -- I'm not following you. Are you saying that in\nsome cases they won't give the consumer the entire file?\nMR. HENDERSON: They -- that's the problem.\nThat's what Congress was intending to address. The way\nit's set up is that, for example, if I apply for credit\nand it's denied, the credit -- the creditor, potential\ncreditor, is supposed to notify me that it was based on a\nreport from, for example, TRW. I am then put on notice --\nQUESTION: Okay. So, you're saying that if the\ncredit reporting service lies to the consumer when the\nconsumer says, tell me what you've got and who you've been\ntelling, then the proviso would have some work to do.\nMR. HENDERSON: Exactly.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: Why? Why? I mean, the -- I still\ndon't see it. Maybe you need an example.\nMy simpleminded thinking of it is the consumer\n-- the credit people make a misrepresentation.\nMR. HENDERSON: To whom?\nQUESTION: To the consumer and it's either\nmaterial or it isn't. If it is material, that must be\nbecause, at least in most cases, it's hidden, some fact\nthat is relevant to showing liability, in which case you\ndon't need the special exception because the person didn't\nknow all the facts. They hadn't discovered it. Or it's\nnot material, in which case it doesn't fall within the\nexception anyway.\nNow, that's my simpleminded thought, and what I\nstarted with and I think I'll continue with is you produce\nan example that proves my simpleminded thought is\nsimplemindedly wrong.\nMR. HENDERSON: And let me give you one. For\nexample, if in the initial credit report that's given out\nthat is erroneous to a user, there are trade accounts that\ndo not belong to the consumer, they belong to someone else\nand they are negative trade accounts, and yet -- and on\nthat basis the -- the user writes to the consumer and\nsays, you don't credit, we've got a credit report from\nTRW, and on that basis we're denying your credit. So, the\nconsumer turns to TRW and says, please give me a credit\nreport, and they look at it and they go, oh, there's all\nthis derogatory information in there that does not belong\nto this consumer, let's get it out of there and give it to\nthe consumer. So, they take out these -- these trade\nlines that are derogatory and -- and in so doing\nmisrepresent information to the consumer in such a way as\nto be material and to deceive the consumer such that the\nconsumer is then misled about the status of the files.\nAnd -- and presumably all this is done with the intent of\ndeceiving the --\nQUESTION: Yes, but under your theory, the\nconsumer is never put on notice.\nQUESTION: Yes. Because the question is simply\nthis. Imagine there were no proviso. Think of the\nexample you just gave. Are you going to admit on your\ntheory that the statute began to run against your\nconsumer, or are you going to say, of course, it didn't\nrun? He didn't discover what was going on.\nMR. HENDERSON: I think under --\nQUESTION: Which are you going to say?\nMR. HENDERSON: -- under the injury discovery\nrule or the actual injury occurrence rule, either one\nwhich we favor, the injury occurs when the credit is\ndenied, and then immediately thereafter the consumer is\nput on notice.\nQUESTION: All right. I understand.\nMR. HENDERSON: And so, yes.\nQUESTION: It is true, though, that under what I\nthink is the prevailing rule in most circuits at least,\nthere would be an equitable estoppel there, and the\nstatutory proviso need not have covered that unless it\nmeant to indicate that there was a -- an injury-based\nstatute of limitations.\nMR. HENDERSON: Well, I think the -- it's true\nthat the equitable estoppel might apply even if they had\nnot added the misrepresentation exception, but as members\nof this Court have recognized, for example, when -- when\nthis Court declined the opportunity to apply a Federal\nrule to class action in civil rights cases, that the\ngeneral rule under Federal law is suspension not renewal,\nwhich means that normally you would just toll the running\nof the limitations period for such amount of time as there\nis -- as there is a deception in place.\nHowever, Congress went out of its way to say\nthat's not the rule here. We want complete renewal. We\nwant 2 full years of unadulterated knowledge in which to\ngo about considering whether to bring a claim. And it --\nand it's odd to think that the Congress would want that 2\nfull years in the situation where a -- when a\nmisrepresentation had sprung up but not allow the same 2\nfull years in the normal case after discovery of an\ninjury.\nQUESTION: Mr. Henderson, your -- your response\nto Justice Breyer's question leaves me with -- with some\nconfusion as to what you mean by injury discovery rule. I\nassumed it meant at the time the consumer knows, one, that\nhe's been injured, number two, by the defendant. And the\nexample that Justice Breyer was given, you say it's enough\nhe just knows he was injured because he was denied credit.\nIs that the rule you want?\nMR. HENDERSON: Well, this Court in Kubrick\nseemed to settle upon an injury and causation accrual\nrule, but I believe that --\nQUESTION: And causation. And -- and you don't\n-- it's enough that he knows he was denied credit and --\nand the statute runs then even if he doesn't know that the\nreason he was denied it was -- was the -- the inaccurate\nreporting.\nMR. HENDERSON: Based on my understanding of the\nlaw that has developed in the courts of appeals in Cada\nand Connors, that it is -- injury alone is enough to set\nthe -- to set the plaintiff on a course of diligence\ntowards the potential presentation of a claim.\nI think obviously the injury and causation\naccrual rule is -- is more liberal and more fair in many\nways. It's the rule in Germany, for example. But --\nbut --\nQUESTION: It destroys -- it destroys the\nexception, so you don't want to use it here.\nMR. HENDERSON: But if I could, Your Honor, I\nwant to just talk also about the actual injury occurrence\nrule.\nIn Hyde v. Hibernia National Bank in 1987, I\nbelieve it was, the Fifth Circuit looked at this statute\nand said in the case of negligence violations, you have an\nactual injury occurrence rule. In the case of willful\nviolations, you really need to discover the fraud. It was\nsomewhat of a -- an elegant theory that -- that was\nderived by the Fifth Circuit, but it's been argued\nthroughout this case at all levels, in the district court.\nIn fact, in the petition at page 24a is a discussion of --\nin the appendix at page 24a is a discussion of Hyde v.\nHibernia National Bank.\nQUESTION: Why isn't the release of -- of\nconfidential information an injury? That -- that does not\ncount as an injury.\nMR. HENDERSON: I don't believe so. If it is an\ninjury, it is the most metaphysical type of injury, such\nas underground trespass where some mining company burrows\nbeneath someone's land that is, by its very nature,\nundiscoverable, unnoticeable. And if it is an injury, it\nis so metaphysical and so unreal that it cries out for the\napplication of the injury discovery rule, which by the\nway, does not require actual discovery in all cases, but\ncan also be invoked by constructive discovery. And yet,\nwhere you have an injury, if it is an injury, of this\nnature that is by its nature undiscoverable, unnoticeable,\nthen of course, you would have to have the injury\ndiscovery rule at hand.\nI want to also point out that there is -- there\nwas some question about the meaning of liability arises.\nCongress more recently has indicated that the phrasing --\nthe phraseology used in this statute, the liability arises\nlanguage, is synonymous with accrual language. And I ask\nthe Court to look at 49 U.S.C., section 32710, and the\ncase of Carasco v. Fiori Enterprises, the site for which\nis 985 F.Supp. 931 at pages 934 through 935. And in that\ncase, the Court recognized that when Congress amended the\nodometer --\nQUESTION: This is a district court decision?\nMR. HENDERSON: It is, and it -- and it analyzes\nwhat Congress did with respect to the odometer --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Henderson.\nMR. HENDERSON: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Jones, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nIN SUPPORT OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. JONES: It's really the second question, of\ncourse, whether if the statute has an injury discovery\nrule, that would be negated by the misrepresentation\nexception. But the Court is focused on that and there is\na direct and simple answer to it.\nIn this Court's own opinion in Rotella, at page\n555, the Court said, in applying a discovery rule, we have\nbeen at pains to explain that discovery of the injury, not\ndiscovery of the other elements of the claim is what\nstarts the clock.\nQUESTION: Well, the difficulty -- the\ndifficulty I'm having with that, though I see that now, is\nbasically what you've done there is you've taken a statute\nthat doesn't discuss any of these things, and you take\nwhat would be a full discovery rule, and then you break it\ninto bits. Now, you say -- you say, well, we're taking a\nbit out of it and that's the work that the proviso will\ndo.\nMR. JONES: The injury discovery rule starts the\nclock in the sense that once you become aware of the\ninjury, you have a duty of inquiry to find out the cause\nof the injury, who caused it, whether it violated your --\na standard of care that was owed to you. If in making\nthat inquiry, the -- the defendant lies to you about one\nof those aspects -- for example, he conceals what he\nactually disclosed -- the statute then gives you 2 years\nfrom the date you discover the truth.\nQUESTION: Suppose I find that a credit\nreporting agency has given incorrect information to -- to\nsomebody who's inquired. I haven't been denied credit.\nIn fact, they give me credit anyway. But I find that they\nhave given inaccurate information. Is that injury\ndiscovery?\nMR. JONES: Well, you're -- you're mixing, I\nthink, two points. One is what is disclosed to you as the\n-- if the consumer.\nQUESTION: No, no.\nMR. JONES: If you think that they violated your\nrights and you ask them something, what they tell you.\nThat's what the misrepresentation --\nQUESTION: No. I -- I discover that the credit\nreporting agency, in -- in its information to Sears,\nincluded erroneous information. Sears has given me credit\nanyway.\nMR. JONES: Right.\nQUESTION: Have I had any injury?\nMR. JONES: It's just erroneous information?\nQUESTION: It's erroneous information.\nMR. JONES: I don't --\nQUESTION: And it's detrimental. It's\ndetrimental but Sears gives -- Sears gives me the credit\nanyway.\nMR. JONES: I don't --\nQUESTION: Have I suffered any injury under this\nstatute?\nMR. JONES: I don't see that you would have,\nbut --\nQUESTION: Wow.\nQUESTION: You might, if there were a higher\ninterest rate charged and you didn't know about that.\nMR. JONES: That's possible, but if you were\ncharged a higher interest rate, you'd probably be on a\nduty of inquiry to -- reasonable diligence to find out\nwhether that was injury to you.\nQUESTION: You don't think that you could then\nget the relief against Sears doing the same thing all over\nagain? You don't think you could tell them to straighten\nout the record for future requests?\nMR. JONES: I didn't say that you wouldn't be\nable to ask them to correct the record.\nQUESTION: If you haven't been injured, how can\nyou get the relief?\nMR. JONES: You'd be entitled to ask them to\ncorrect the records, and you'd be entitled to have them do\nso. But --\nQUESTION: You mean they'd be liable. They'd be\nliable in a suit.\nMR. JONES: They'd be required to correct the --\nQUESTION: For an injunction.\nMR. JONES: Here's the way that would work, as I\nunderstand it. If I asked them to correct the records and\nthey failed to do so without a reasonable cause, I could\nbring a suit to require them to correct the records, and\nif they willfully refused to do so, I might be able to\nprove both actual damages and punitive damages. But I\nwould still have to have some actual damages before I got\na monetary recovery.\nQUESTION: Do you think the word liability in\nthe statute refers only to monetary recovery?\nMR. JONES: I think that -- well, I think the\nword liability in this statute, like any statute that uses\ncause of action accrues, cause of action arises -- these\nare ambiguous terms that the court has to interpret based\non the purpose of the statute.\nQUESTION: Don't they include injunction and\nrefer not merely to monetary damages, but to an action for\ninjunction?\nMR. JONES: There is not a statutory action for\nan injunction. There is a statutory action for damages\nwhen the -- when the defendant either acts negligently --\nQUESTION: Where does the action for injunction\ncome from if not from the statute?\nMR. JONES: It comes from the invocation of the\ncommon law when --\nQUESTION: I don't believe in Federal common\nlaw. If there's -- there's a cause of action, it's a\ncause of action under the statute.\nMR. JONES: Well, it's -- it's a cause of action\nthat perfects the rights created by the statute. I\nwouldn't call it an implied right of action, but I would\nthink that a Federal court sitting in equity would be able\nto give an injunction to enjoin repeated violations of a\nstatute.\nQUESTION: Before there's any liability, but you\ncan't get money damages before there's any liability.\nMR. JONES: That's doesn't strike me as a\nstartling idea, that the -- that an injunction can be\ngiven in a situation when you're not able to obtain money\nrelief.\nQUESTION: But you do have to assume that\nthere's a violation for the injunction to lie.\nMR. JONES: That's correct. You have to -- you\nhave to determine that for an injunction to be given.\nBut this -- the question here -- I mean, the\nsecond half of the question I think is easily answered,\nand if the Court has more questions on that, fine, but if\nnot, I'd like to address the first question, which is does\nthe phrase, liability arise, suggest an interpretation\nthat -- that -- from which we would conclude that the\ninjury discovery rule applied as opposed to the injury\naccrual rule.\nAnd Congress often creates remedies for -- for\ninjuries that are latent or hidden, and -- and it's\nimprobable to assume that when Congress does so, it\nintends to curtail that remedy before even a diligent\nplaintiff could be expected to learn of it. And so, the\ninjury discovery rule has been applied by the courts in\ninterpreting these kinds of vague provisions like\nliability arises and cause of action accrues to give them\nmeaning in the context where there's a hidden or latent\nclaim that wouldn't be expected to be discovered in the\nordinary course.\nQUESTION: But it is odd in the context of a\nstatute that has the other language in it where Congress\nspells it out. Yes, here we think there has to be\ndiscovery. I just find the juxtaposition in this statute\ndifficult to overcome.\nMR. JONES: There -- there is nothing odd. In\nfact, it's ordinary, as -- as it was pointed out, for this\nkind of fraudulent concealment or equitable estoppel rule\nto be applied to a statute that has an injury discovery\nprovision.\nQUESTION: No, that isn't odd. What's odd is --\nwhat is odd is how it's expressed. If -- if the first\npart was expressed in intending to have a discovery rule,\nthe way it was, you would expect the last part to have\nbeen expressed, the action may be brought at any time\nwithin 2 years after the misrepresentation because --\nMR. JONES: The -- Justice --\nQUESTION: Of course, you would imply 2 years\nafter discovery of the misrepresentation.\nMR. JONES: Justice Scalia, the\nmisrepresentation is -- is of any fact material to the\nviolation. The discovery rule is only of the injury, as\nthis Court said in Rotella and as the other courts have\nalso held. If -- you -- you can know of the injury and\nnot know what caused it or who or whether they were liable\nfor it. And if they -- the defendant lies about that,\nwhen you're trying to inquire, during this 2-year period\nfrom discovery of the injury -- if they lie about that,\nthe statute can -- comes in and says, we're not going to\nlet them profit from their lie. They're going to be --\nyou're going to get another 2 years from the time you\ndiscover the injury.\nQUESTION: But that's always true under\nequitable estoppel.\nMR. JONES: I'm sorry. Discover the lie. I'm\nsorry.\nQUESTION: That's always true under equitable\nestoppel.\nMR. JONES: That is -- that is --\nQUESTION: You have that -- now, it's true that\nthe whole -- the statute doesn't run, but you don't have 2\nyears.\nMR. JONES: Right. This statute does not -- is\nnot a codification of the entire doctrine of equitable\nestoppel. It's a specification of the doctrine of\nequitable estoppel in the specific context of these kinds\nof claims. And it's focuses on these -- these specific\ntypes of claims. So, I don't know whether it intends to\npreclude any broader equitable estoppel doctrine, but I do\nknow that what Congress has provided is simply a\napplication of the equitable estoppel rule in the specific\ncontext of this statute.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm a little nervous. Perhaps\nCongress -- I don't know if I would have written the\nstatute this way, but I assume that the credit companies\nwere arguing, look, if you have a discovery rule here\nacross the board, even discovery injury, what will happen\nis 45 million Americans who never ask for their report, 2\nmillion do. All right? 20 years later, it turns out that\nwe used an unreasonable procedure 20 years ago. And\nlawyers for the 45 million others will start combing the\nrecords to find out how there was an invasion of privacy\nor some other injury, and before you know it, will\nproliferate lawsuits about things that happened 20 or 30\nyears ago and created only minor injuries that people\ndidn't even know about then.\nMR. JONES: Well, you have the -- under the\ninjury discovery rule, you have the requirement that the\nplaintiff act with some reasonable diligence.\nQUESTION: They -- they don't know. They don't\nknow who was -- you know, there's no way to know if it was\nan unreasonable procedure, who was told what.\nMR. JONES: Well, if they don't -- if they don't\nmake any inquiry at all over 20 years, I think a court\ncould conclude that they didn't act with reasonable\ndiligence. I certainly don't know of any decision\napplying the injury discovery rule that refuses to apply\nit simply because it may have applications. I mean, I've\nnever seen a court say that when these kinds of hidden\nharms are -- are remedied by Congress, Congress meant to\nlet them go unremedied if they weren't discovered. I\nmean, it's just the opposite. It's because as -- as\npetitioner says, yes, you can have injuries that aren't\ndiscovered.\nQUESTION: But you -- you can discover the\nmisrepresentation, that -- that is, the -- the erroneous\ncredit information. You can discover that and you can sue\nindefinitely after that. That doesn't start anything\nrunning. It's only when you find that that misinformation\nhas caused a denial of credit that your cause of action\narises. You can just leave it there.\nMR. JONES: The -- there are two different\naspects of this case. One is the inaccurate -- inaccurate\nreports, which is I believe what you're talking about, but\nthen there's the thing that can never be discovered, which\nis the improper disclosure. When I say can never be\nrecovered, I mean is not ordinarily going to be likely to\nbe discovered.\nThis case actually only involves the improper\ndisclosure. And the Court's analysis of this statute of\nlimitations issue should appropriately focus on the fact\nthat these kinds of improper disclosures are inherently\nhidden and not going to be known by the -- by the\nplaintiff.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Jones.\n"
