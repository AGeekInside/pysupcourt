        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Osborn v. Haley.\nMr. Grant.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC GRANT\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. GRANT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe court of appeals misinterpreted the\nWestfall Act in a way that unfairly deprives tort\nplaintiffs of the most basic procedural protections\nroutinely afforded in both Federal and State courts.\nThat misinterpretation cannot be reconciled with the\ntext and history of the statute, the nature and\noperation of official immunity or the jurisdictional\nlimitations of article III. Accordingly, the judgment\nof the court of appeals should be reversed and this\nState law case should be remanded to the State courts\nwhere it rightfully belongs. In the alternative, the\ncourt of appeals judgment should be vacated for lack of\nappellate jurisdiction.\nPrior to the Westfall Act, courts considered\nwhether, assuming the alleged acts occurred, the Federal\nemployee was acting within the scope of his employment.\nIn Westfall v. Erwin, this Court added the additional\nrequirement that the acts be undertaken with a\ndiscretionary function, but invited Congress to address\nthe issue. In responding with the Westfall Act,\nCongress did not change the basic rule that scope of\nemployment sets the line for immunity. Indeed, Congress\nconfirmed that rule. In particular, Congress gave no\nhint that it was radically rewriting the rules to direct\nFederal district courts to determine the merits of\nwholly State law claims in some sort of unprecedented\nsummary proceeding.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it a wholly State\nlaw claim if the principal matter is whether this\nFederal employee is immune from suit? That's the\nthreshold question that has to be answered. It's\ndetermined wholly by Federal law, so you must get\nthrough that Federal law gateway before you can go any\nplace else in the suit.\nMR. GRANT: Your Honor, that is true in\nperhaps a majority of Westfall Act cases, but in cases\nlike this and a significant and recurring subset of\ncases there is no Federal law question because scope of\nemployment simply is not at issue. What the Government\ndoes in those subset of cases is merely to assert the\ndefense of he didn't do it or it never happened.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- it's not it\nnever happened as though the Federal employee was off in\nHong Kong. He was there on the premises. He is\nclaiming that whatever he did was within the scope of\nhis authority. It seems like it's a question of\nphraseology that you're dealing with.\nMR. GRANT: With respect, Your Honor, that\nis not the case, certainly in this case and in others.\nThe Government has conceded that if Respondent Barry\nHaley acted as alleged in the complaint he was acting\noutside the course and scope of his Federal employment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I think Justice\nGinsburg's point, and it concerns me as well, is that\nthe Government is entitled to say that during the time\nthe event occurred, i.e., the firing, he was on duty and\nhe refrained from committing any unlawful act.\nMR. GRANT: Your Honor, there may be cases\nwhere even if the acts occurred, they were within the\ncourse and scope of the Federal employment. But in the\ncase like this, as in Wood versus United States, as in\nMelo v. Hafer in the Third Circuit, the Government\nconcedes, because the law and the facts require the\nGovernment and the employee to concede, that if the\nalleged acts took place they were necessarily outside\nthe scope of employment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the actual\nstatutory language refers to acting within the scope of\nemployment at the time of the incident, and so a\ncertification based on the view that at the time of the\nalleged incident, he was acting entirely within his\nscope would seem to be within the language of the\nstatute.\nMR. GRANT: Your Honor, on its face the\ncertification in this case, as in others, tracks the\nstatutory language. But when the Government's position\nwas examined in the district court, it became apparent\nthat the Government's essential defense, in fact\nsupported by two declarations, including the declaration\nof Respondent Haley, was that he simply did not do the\nacts alleged.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the question is\nwhat the district court should examine, and the statute\ntalks about the incident out of which the claim arose.\nSo that necessarily requires the Government to look at\nthe complaint, see the incident out of which this claim\narises, whether or not the claim is true, and to certify\nit.\nMR. GRANT: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: \"Out of which the claim\narose\" it seems to me is of some importance. But the\ndissenting judges in the First Circuit case, Wood,\ndidn't think it was important. I'm not sure they were\nright about that.\nMR. GRANT: Your Honor, this Court has\nconsistently made a distinction between immunity and the\nmerits. Starting in cases like Mitchell versus Forsyth\nin 1985 and continuing through cases like Richardson\nversus McKnight in 1997, the Court has consistently\nrecognized that immunity is different from a defense on\nthe merits. It's different from a defense of he didn't\ndo it or it never happened. And I would say that,\nalthough the time of the incident is important, that is\nonly one of several factors certainly under Kentucky law\nin determining whether something happened within the\ncourse and scope of employment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well how is it -- I\nmean, that line is awfully difficult to draw. You assert\nhe didn't do it versus something else. But it's easy,\nlet's say it's an assault case and the person says, you\nhit me, and the person says, well, it was entirely an\naccident; I was gesticulating with my hand so it wasn't,\nwouldn't have met the requirements for the tort. Now,\nare they denying the incident in that case?\nMR. GRANT: Your Honor, the Court in Wood v.\nUnited States took account of the possibilities of\nartful pleading and would allow the Government to\nchallenge the characterization of the incident.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's not just a\ncharacterization. If it's something that has, for\nexample, a mental element, the plaintiff can assert, you\ndid that with malice aforethought and the defendant can\nsay, no, I didn't. Now, is that a characterization or\nis that a denial of the incident?\nMR. GRANT: I believe that's a\ncharacterization, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't it the denial of\nan element of the claim? There's no recovery for\nassault if the mental element is what the Chief Justice\njust described in his hypo, and if in fact that is an\nelement of the claim how do you draw a distinction\nbetween that and the existence or nonexistence of any\nact at all.\nMR. GRANT: There are, Your Honor, certain\ncases in which --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I'm not asking about\ncertain cases. I just want to know analytically how you\ndo it or how you think we're supposed to do it.\nMR. GRANT: There are cases in which the\nmerits and the immunity defense overlap and in those\ncases the district courts are fully empowered to make\nfactual findings.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, in this case the\nimmunity defense is, number one, as you said, the\nGovernment forthrightly said at the beginning right in\nterms of the statute that he was acting within the scope\nof his employment. Secondarily, as you said, the\nGovernment in effect elaborated on that and said the\nreason he was not acting outside the scope of his\nemployment is that these acts which would have been\noutside scope didn't happen. Why is that any\ndifferent from the claim in the Chief Justice's hypo\nthat there was no intent to harm?\nMR. GRANT: Your Honor, because a claim of,\nthat the alleged act did not occur, that he didn't do\nit, is not a claim of immunity. Again, this --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's a claim upon which the\nimmunity depends. The immunity is claimed -- the\nimmunity claimed here is that at the time in question he\nwas not acting outside the scope of his employment. The\nreason he was not acting outside the scope was that he\ndidn't do what they say he did.\nMR. GRANT: Your Honor, I'm sorry if I have\nthe same answer to the question, but again, this Court's\njurisprudence has consistently distinguished between\ndefenses, so to speak, on the merits, a claim that the\nalleged act did not occur, that one of the elements of\nthe State law claim is not met.\nJUSTICE ALITO: In this case, if Mr. Haley\nhad said, I had some conversations with the private\nemployer and the plaintiff's name was mentioned during\nthe conversations, but I never told them to discharge\nher, would this, would that be something -- would your\nargument apply there?\nMR. GRANT: It would apply, Your Honor, if,\nif that factual determination were relevant to scope of\nemployment under the applicable law, namely the agency\nlaw of Kentucky.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, is it? I mean,\nthat's -- the problem that I have with your argument,\nMr. Grant, is that in life things are often not, it\nhappened or it didn't happen. There is a middle\nground, which is this officer is saying, I was there at\nthe relevant time or place and when I was there\neverything that I did was within the scope of my\nemployment, I didn't do anything that was outside the\nscope of my employment.\nMR. GRANT: There are cases in which there\nis a middle ground, Your Honor. But this case is not\none of them, and there is certainly a distinct and\nrecurring subset of cases, like Wood and Melo and\nKimbro, where it is conceded on the facts and the law\nthat if the actions occurred, they occurred outside the\nscope of employment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand why\nanyone would want to come out the way you urge us to\ncome out. Why would it make any sense to give a Federal\nemployee the benefit of trial in Federal court when he\ncommitted the act, and then you debate about whether it\nwas, whether there was liability or not, and yet deprive\nhim of the benefit of a Federal court when he denies\nthat he did anything at all? Why would you want one set\nof cases to remain in the State court and the other set\nof cases to go to Federal court?\nMR. GRANT: Your Honor, it's Congress that\nset the line at scope of employment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, that's what\nwe're debating, whether the line is there or not, and as\nyou've seen from the discussion, there is at least some\nambiguity in it. There being ambiguity, why should we\nfind a line that doesn't make any sense?\nMR. GRANT: Well, Your Honor, I believe that\nline does make sense because if the Government's view is\nadopted and the view of the majority of the court of\nappeals, the merits of the wholly State law claim will\nbe resolved in Federal court and resolved in a\nprocedural context that denies a tort plaintiff the\nright to discovery, that denies the tort plaintiff a\nright to the normal evidentiary presumptions on a motion\nto dismiss or motion for summary judgment, and denies\nthat tort plaintiff the right to a jury trial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that can happen when in\nfact the certification of the Attorney General turns out\nto be wrong and there isn't any immunity. Still, the\nwhole thing is going to be tried in Federal court.\nMR. GRANT: Your Honor, in that situation,\nthe merits will at least be tried under the normal\nprovisions for discovery and evidentiary presumptions,\neven if it does ultimately proceed against the United\nStates.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But Mr. Grant, I'm a\nlittle puzzled. Why is the discovery in the Federal\nsystem any less valuable in the State system?\nMR. GRANT: Because what the Government\nadvocates here, as I think most starkly illustrated by\nthe Third Circuit's decision in Melo v. Hafer is some\nsort of summary proceeding that takes place before the\nnormal processes of Federal litigation. After all, it's\nthe Government's position that this employee is immune.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't that only summary\nfor the purpose of deciding whether the removal was\nproper?\nMR. GRANT: It's for the purpose of deciding\nscope of employment, but the Government's interpretation\nof that phrase encompasses essentially the merits of the\ncase.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not for\ndeciding whether removal -- I thought the statute says\nthat the Attorney General's certification is conclusive\nwith respect to removal.\nMR. GRANT: It is conclusive, Your Honor, in\nthose cases that truly do implicate scope of employment.\nIn this case, by contrast, the certification was\nessentially to raise the he didn't do it or it never\nhappened defense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what does it\nmean to say that the certification is conclusive with\nrespect to scope of employment for purposes of removal\nif it doesn't mean that it's conclusive, if you're going\nto have judicial review that is going to address the\nquestion of removal as opposed to the validity of the\ncertification on the merits?\nMR. GRANT: Your Honor, it's conclusive\nwhere it satisfies the definition in the statute. What\nis conclusive in the final sentence of paragraph (d)(2)\nof section 2679 is this certification, and this\ncertification of course is the one referred to earlier\nin that paragraph.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're saying\nit's only conclusive if it's right?\nMR. GRANT: No, Your Honor. It's only, it\ncan be conclusive right or wrong, but it's only\nconclusive if it satisfies the statutory definition,\nbeing about scope of employment, not about the merits.\nIn this case, for example, there never will be, never\ncould be a true scope of employment determination, the\nGovernment having conceded it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose, Mr. Grant, that\nthe district court had said, I'm going to deny the\nsubstitution of the United States as the defendant, but\nI realize that this is a debatable question, so I'm not\ngoing to order a remand until the defendant and the United\nStates have had a chance to challenge my initial ruling\nthat I deny the substitution of the United States.\nSuppose that it had happened that way? Would you have any\nright to get back in the State court? Wouldn't that\nproperly go to a court of appeals?\nMR. GRANT: Your Honor, that, that could\ncertainly go to the court of appeals under the\ndiscretionary appeal procedure in section 1292(b), or\nperhaps by mandamus.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, suppose that\nhappened, and then the court of appeals said the United\nStates should have been substituted?\nMR. GRANT: That would -- that would on its\nmerits restrict the district court from remanding, but\nof course in this case, the district court did enter an\norder of remand based on its interpretation of section\n2679.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But your position is that\nthe Attorney General's certification is conclusive --\nis not conclusive in those situations in which the\nAttorney General doesn't draw the line properly between\nan event denying answer and an event characterizing\nanswer? Whenever the Attorney General is wrong on that\nvery nuanced decision in some instances, then the\nAttorney General's certification is not conclusive?\nMR. GRANT: The short answer is yes, Your\nHonor. The Attorney General's certification is not\nconclusive where it does not satisfy the statutory\ndefinition, where it is not a certification that truly\nimplicates scope of employment. We have tried to draw\nthe distinction between an unauthorized or improper\ncertification, one that doesn't meet the statutory\ndefinition, and a certification as, as the Court in\nAliota versus Graham said was wrong or erroneous on its\nmerits, so to speak, on the facts, on the law, of State\nagency law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Grant, these items\nwe've been discussing are perhaps the more important\nfeatures of the case. But your argument in your brief\ndidn't begin with those. It began with the assertion\nthat there is no jurisdiction to review the district\ncourt's remand order at all. I take it you're not\nabandoning that, are you?\nMR. GRANT: Absolutely not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then why was it first in\nyour brief and not first in your argument?\nMR. GRANT: It was first in my brief because\nthis Court ordered me to brief and address it, and I was\nhappy to do so. The court of appeals in fact did lack\njurisdiction in this case. This Court has made clear as\nrecently as the Kircher opinion last term that section\n1447(d) means what it says. And in this case, the\ndistrict court entered an order remanding the case to\nthe State court from which it was removed, and 1447(d),\nof course, bars review of that order by appeal or\notherwise.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is at least\nconsiderable tension with 1447(d), though, and\n2679(d)(2), in that that specifically says that for\npurposes of removal, the Attorney General's certification\nis conclusive. And it doesn't, if you look at 2679, it\nsuggests, you'd think that case would proceed in Federal\ncourt rather than be immediately remanded without the\navailability of review.\nMR. GRANT: Your Honor, on the merits of the\ninterpretation of 2679(d)(2), we tried to explain why\nconclusive does not operate in a case like this, but I\nthink the important point for jurisdiction is that this\nCourt has consistently said that even if a district\ncourt misinterprets a jurisdictional statute, that\nreview is nonetheless barred by section 1447(d).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is a different\ntype of jurisdictional statute in that there is concern\non Congress's part here to provide a Federal forum for\nthe adjudication of whether something is within the\nscope of a Federal employee's duty. It's not\ninconceivable, but it would seem illogical to\nspecifically provide for review of that determination\nbut then have that review take place in State court\nrather than Federal court.\nMR. GRANT: Well, Your Honor, Congress\nobviously knows how to make exceptions to section\n1447(d). I believe it was footnote eight of this\nCourt's opinion in Kircher that cited a number of\nexamples. The Government in its brief relied on 12\nU.S.C. section 1441(a), and that statute which involved\nthe Resolution Trust Corporation specifically refers to\nappeal and remand. And so what this Court has said is,\nthe bar of section 1447(d), which has been around for\nmore than a century, is not to be ignored unless there\nis a clear statutory command that makes an exception.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But here not only, not only\ndoes it say that the Attorney General's certification is\nconclusive for purposes of removal, but there is no\nmention about remand in relation to a case that is\nremoved after the Attorney General's certification.\nWhereas by contrast, where the Attorney General doesn't\ncertify and the case is removed, the statute does\naddress the issue of remand. So if you put those two\nthings together, isn't it perfectly clear that Congress\ndid not want these cases that are removed on the\nAttorney General's certification to be remanded?\nMR. GRANT: No, Your Honor. The authority\nto remand in this case proceeds from subsection C of\nsection 1447. As this Court has said in various cases,\nincluding the International Primate Protection League\ncase in 1991, when a Federal district court lacks\nsubject matter jurisdiction because a case, a party\nattempting to remove has done so without authority to do\nso, section 1447(c) obliges a remand.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought your\nanswer would have been even if, even if the remand was\nimproper, even if it is the case that, what is it,\n(d)(2) envisions that the suit remain in the Federal\ncourt. Nonetheless, if there is an erroneous remand, it\nis still a remand that is covered by the prohibition of\nreview. I mean, we said in other cases that even when\nthe remand is wrong, the remand is not reviewable.\nMR. GRANT: That is my answer, Your Honor.\nSection (d)(2) goes, gives direction to district courts,\nbut section 1447(d) gives direction to appellate courts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If that's your answer, can\nI go back to the other main issue for a second? I would\nhave thought that your case, unfortunately for you in my\nmind, is the classic case where there should be\njurisdiction because the AG is supposed to say look, I\ndon't think anything happened, okay? So he was doing\nhis job all day. But if something did happen, I'll tell\nyou what, it was within the scope of his employment.\nAnd apparently, that's just what they did say here. And\nthen it got mixed up in the courts below. In other\nwords, if he made some phone calls and even if he\nmentioned the employee, even if he said something\nimproper, it was within the scope of his employment,\nwhich is just what they said. So because of that, it\nseems to me this makes a lot of complexity out of\nnothing. Now you explain what your answer is.\nMR. GRANT: Your Honor, with respect, I\nbelieve the Attorney General said just the opposite,\nthat --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In the district court he\ndidn't say, if something happened here, it was in the\nscope of his employment? I thought he had. Maybe he\nhadn't. I thought he had, but I'll ask him that.\nMR. GRANT: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In the district court I\nthought he said that.\nMR. GRANT: The Attorney General's\nsubmission, the Government's submission in the district\ncourt was that nothing happened.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it was there first,\nbut you can argue in the defense alternative, I think\nnothing happened. But if the plaintiff can convince a\njury otherwise, fine, but then what they can convince\nhim of is within the scope of his employment. Now did\nthat happen in the district court, that they said\nsomething like that or not?\nMR. GRANT: Your Honor, the Government did\nmake what it called an alternative argument.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why can't they do\nthat, which is just what Wood says they can do, if\nanybody, you know, thinks that's valid? But the --\nwhat's the problem then? Because I would have thought\nthat the reason this case appears difficult is because\nyours is a case where the AG should be able to come in\nand remove it.\nMR. GRANT: The district court, the very\nsame district court that the Government so, so\ndesperately wants to review the facts of this case, said\nthat given Mr. Haley's declaration under penalty of\nperjury, it would not accept that alternative.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it's wrong in that,\nisn't it?\nMR. GRANT: Well, the Government did not\nappeal that point in the court of appeals, and in fact --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, the Wood issue was\nthe issue of where if anything happened, of course it's\noutside the scope. It's like one employee shoots\nanother, you know. There is nothing to do with scope of\nemployment there, it's plainly outside. And of course,\nthis act, in my view then, then, was that this is not an\nact that allows the AG to defend that kind of thing.\nBut if it's arguable at least that something happened,\nif it happened at all it was within the scope of\nemployment, the AG can defend it.\nMR. GRANT: Your Honor, the Government --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's the problem with --\nthere should be a problem with what I say from your\npoint of view, so --\nMR. GRANT: I think the problem is in the\nrecord, Your Honor, and the Government's brief at the,\nat the petition stage on page 14 in note five quotes its\nown appellate brief in the court of appeals, and that\nbrief says the memorandum of understanding between the\nForest Service and the private respondent showed that if\nHaley did cause the contractor to fire Osborn, he acted\noutside the scope of his employment. And the court of\nappeals quite logically took that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you're saying they have\nabandoned the argument?\nMR. GRANT: They have Your Honor and the\ncourt of appeals recognized that on page 3a of the\npetition appendix. If the Court has no further\nquestions I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Grant. Mr. Hallward-Driemeier.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER,\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice\nand may it please the Court:\nIn the Westfall Act Congress provided an\nabsolute immunity for Federal employees for acts\ntaken within the scope of their employment and it\nwent further and provided that when the Attorney\nGeneral certifies that the employee was acting\nwithin the scope of his employment at the time of\nthe incident out of which the claim arose, that that\nissue of Federal immunity is to be decided by the\nFederal court. It is the Attorney General's assertion\nof this Federal defense of immunity that satisfies\narticle III just as the employee's own assertion of\nimmunity satisfies article III under the Federal Officer\nRemoval statute and just as a, in other circumstances a\nplaintiff's assertion of a claim under Federal law\nsatisfies article III.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what if the\nAttorney General certifies and removes a case in a\ncriminal case, a case clearly not within the statute?\nWhat happens then?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I think that\nthe, the -- that would probably be a defect in removal\nprocedure rather than a jurisdictional defect but even\nif it is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, on the\nprocedure, he follows the procedure meticulously; it's\njust wrong. It's a criminal case. The statute says he\ncan do it in a civil case. On the other hand the statute\nalso says that his certification is conclusive.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor\neven if that is a case that would be removed without\njurisdiction, that case is quite different from this\ncase because this case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, this one is a\ncivil one and that's a criminal, but I'm just\ntrying to understand how broad your argument that this\nis not subject to further review goes.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the issue\nthat is not subject to further review for purposes of\njurisdiction is the Attorney General's certification\nthat the employee was acting within scope. The\nstatute doesn't provide that the Attorney General's\ncertification that it is a civil action is conclusive\nbut only the Attorney General's certification that the\nemployee was acting within scope is conclusive for\npurposes of removal. That's the essential element of\nthe Federal defense and that's what satisfies article\nIII jurisdiction. And in fact, this Court in the\nWillingham case recognized that an employee could assert\na claim of Federal immunity even though he was also at\nthe same time denying that he caused any harm to the\nplaintiff.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well I thought your\nanalogy to Willingham was a strong one until you go back\nand read the statute. Willingham is a very different\nstatutory predicate. It's acting under color of law.\nThis is much more specific. At the time of the\nincident, he was acting within his scope, so I'm not\nsure the analogy holds up.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well if anything\nthe language of the Westfall Act is broader because as\nYour Honor emphasized earlier, the statute, the Westfall\nact provides that the Attorney General is to certify\nthat at the time of the incident out of which the claim\narose the employee was acting within the scope. So\narguably the necessary question is what was the employee\ndoing at the time. The Federal Officer Removal statute\nis somewhat narrower because it requires that the claim\narise out of the, the acts taken under color of office.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But yet that would\nbe a good argument if the statute said the Attorney\nGeneral can certify that the employee did not do\nanything outside the scope of his employment, but it's\nphrased in the affirmative. He has to certify that he\nwas acting within the scope of his employment.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. And\nthat's what the Attorney General did here, certified\nthat Mr. Haley was acting within the scope of his\nemployment at the time of the incident out of which the\nclaim arose. And as several --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that's the issue then.\nAnd what I -- is my, my question for you is this, let's\nimagine not this case, which as I said I think is too\ncomplicated and probably is one that the Government\nshould be able to defend, but suppose it's an assault\nlike Wood's, a sexual assault and there is absolutely no\ndoubt that if it happened it was outside the scope of\nemployment, everybody concedes it but Government. And\nthe Government's position is, nothing happened. All\nright? Nothing happened. You say Government, would you\nlike to argue that if something happened, and they may\nbe able to prove something, something like a movement?\nNo, we agree there was nothing like that, we agree\nnothing like that happened; we are not going to defend\non any scope of employment ground. All we are arguing\nis that ordinary work went on and that was within the\nscope of employment. Now, does this act cover it or\nnot? Your view is yes and you read, you know I thought\nit was a close question but you read what I thought the\nother way in Wood, though it was obviously a close\nquestion. So what is your basic response to that?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: You are correct\nthat our view is that yes, the Attorney General can\ncertify in that case. The issue is really one along a\ncontinuum as I think Your Honor has recognized. Of on,\non the one extreme, one might say that the Attorney\nGeneral must accept all of the plaintiff's allegations\nas true. And, and I don't think that anybody here is\narguing that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the position of\nthe district court, though, wasn't it?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That was the\nposition of the district court, although I don't think\nthe Petitioner is now advocating that view. And that\nview would certainly be inconsistent; it would create\nthe anomaly that the Attorney General's authority to\ncertify scope and to assert the immunity on behalf of\nthe employee would be narrower than the employee's own\nauthority to assert the immunity, because again going back\nto the Willingham case, the Court never asked whether it\nwould be within the scope of employment for the prison\nofficials to have maliciously tortured the prisoner;\nrather the defense was we didn't harm the prisoner but\nanything that happened between us and the prisoner\nhappened within the scope of our employment. And so the\nAttorney General's authority to certify has to be at\nleast as broad as that in our view.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The basic point I think in\nWood is this. I'm the district judge. And the\nGovernment, you come in and argue in the alternative.\nNothing happened, but if it did happen it was within the\nscope of employment and they say there is no\npossibility. You'd say, plaintiff, I want to know here\nif there is a reasonable chance, maybe any chance, that\na jury could find that something went on here that was\nwithin the scope of employment that shouldn't have. And\nif the answer to that question is no, the defendant wins\neither because of summary judgment or because -- no,\nsorry. I've gotten lost in what I said. Do you follow\nit?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The -- I think I do.\nIn our view --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Good, I'm glad\nthat someone did.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: In our view, it\nwould be anomalous that the, that the more innocent\nemployee would be deprived of the benefits of the\nWestfall Act, and if I could use a more simple --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I was talking really about\npracticality of it. I don't think you can give me a\ncase that is going to be hard for me as a district judge\nto decide because I'm going to ask you, the Government,\nto tell me if anything went on here that might have been\nwithin the scope of employment. And I look at what\nyou're saying; if you say no, if you say no you can't\ndefend it. If you say yes, you can defend it and that's\ngoing to be the end of it as long as your view is based\non a reasonable reading of the record.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I don't think\nthat that could be the end of it. As Justice Ginsburg\npointed out, reality is much murkier than the black or\nwhite and even in the hypothetical that Your Honor\nposes, it is quite possible that as the case progresses,\nthe plaintiff is going to attempt to introduce evidence\nthat is much more ambiguous as to whether the employee\nwas acting within the scope or not.\nIf I could use a simple example of assault.\nIf the, if a supervisor is dressing down her employee\nfor, for inadequate work, the employee then sues the\nsupervisor alleging that she assaulted her, shaking her\nfist right under her nose, threatening harm to her.\nEven if that would be outside the scope of employment,\nthe employee might say -- the supervisor rather might\nsay, I never raised my hand at all. I raised my voice\ncertainly but I never raised my hand. A third party\nwitness may say well I saw the supervisor wag her finger\nat the employee but not in a threatening fashion. Now --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And as long as a jury could\nfind that there is a view of the record such that the\nplaintiff might prove something wrong that it was within\nthe scope of employment, such as finger wagging that\nhits her forehead, for example, you can defend it.\nWhat's the problem?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, if the\nemployee --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The only problem is if you\nadmit that you can't prove anything like that.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: If the employee was\nacting within the scope of the employment when she\nwagged a finger, then a fortiori she was acting within\nthe scope of her employment when she didn't raise her\nhand at all.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, not a fortiori, for the\nreason that Congress wrote this statute not to give the\ndefendant the right to call in the Government to defend\nhim no matter what he did. The reason that Congress\nwrote the statute was to repeal the Westfall case, which\nwas a question of the scope of immunity, which was the\nquestion of the scope of Government responsibility to\ntake away that limited determination in Westfall. That\nwas the only point. Congress could have written a\nstatute the way. What's your response to that?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: But Congress made,\nestablished an absolute immunity where the employee was\nacting within the scope of employment, and Petitioner\nagrees that scope of employment is the essential\nquestion for immunity. So if in my hypothetical the\nsupervisor was acting within the scope of her employment\nwhen she dressed down, raising her voice but not raising\nher fist, her, her subordinate, then she is protected by\nthe Westfall Act from a claim arising out of the context\nof that employment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what happens in a\ncase where the certification is clearly wrong? I mean,\nyou get into a fight with your neighbor. It's got\nnothing to do with your employment at all but the\nAttorney General certifies that it does. You know:\n\"They are always thinking about your cases. You must\nhave been thinking about it at the time.\" That\ncertification goes into the district court. The\ndistrict court looks at it and says this is ridiculous,\nthrows it out, then that State law assault case proceeds\nin Federal court?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Your Honor, the\nCongress enacted the Westfall Act against the\npresumption of regularity of Federal officials and that\nis of course what this Court has often said as well, and\nso I don't think we should construe the statute on the\npresumption that the Attorney General would, would\ncertify ridiculous cases.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well what about the,\nLamagno, where the question was, was the employee\nworking within the scope of his employment or was he off\non a frolic of his own? I think that's the kind of\nquestion that the Chief Justice put to you. The\ncertification, if it were wrong, the Attorney General\nsaid what he was doing was within the scope of\nemployment and turned out he was on a drunken binge with\nhis friends and they got in his car and killed someone.\nIf that certification within the scope was wrong and\ninstead he is on a frolic of his own, then the United\nStates isn't substituted.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. That\nwould mean that the district court did not on the merits\nultimately uphold the defense of immunity, but as the\nCourt said in Mesa, the merits of the immunity defense\nhave nothing whatsoever to do with the question of\njurisdiction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that that case\nwas about, was the certification reviewable?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right.\nLamagno was about whether the certification was\nreviewable. Your Honor is also correct about the facts\nof that case. One of the points of dispute between the\nGovernment and the plaintiffs there was whether\nMr. Lamagno was drunk at the time of the accident, and,\nand the Attorney General certified on his understanding\nthat Mr. Lamagno was not drunk. And that was upheld by\nthe district court on remand after some discovery and\nsummary judgment type litigation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Court said that\nthat could be reviewed.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. It\ncan be reviewed and the Attorney General's certification\nis not conclusive for purposes of the substitution.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It is conclusive\nfor purposes of the court's removal jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does that mean? Does\nthat mean that if the district court finds that in fact\nthe defendant was not acting within the scope of his\nemployment, the United States is eliminated as the\ndefendant and the individual employee is resubstituted?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes, Your Honor.\nThat's what happened. But, and in that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where, where does that come\nfrom?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the procedure\nfor what happens upon the district court's review is not\nspelled out in the Westfall Act, neither is the review\nitself in particular. But the, the employee --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe the United States\nshould remain the party defendant and the United States\nshould pay which would be the, you know, the price of\nthe Attorney General's certification. He should be\ncareful what he certifies.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the uniform\nview of the lower courts is that when the certification is\noverturned, the effect is to resubstitute the employee\nas the defendant and it proceeds in Federal court as a\npendent claim. The Attorney General's assertion of the\ndefense of immunity which we presume to be colorable\nbecause we presume regularity by the Attorney General,\nconfers article III jurisdiction on the courts, even\nthough it may ultimately on the merits be rejected.\nThis Court held in the Carnegie-Mellon case that the\ndistrict courts have discretion whether to exercise\njurisdiction over pendent claims once the Federal\nquestion has been resolved. If the courts have\ndiscretion to exercise that pendent jurisdiction, then\ncertainly Congress can instruct them to exercise that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they wouldn't\nhave discretion in that case, though, because the\nstatute says the Attorney General's certification is\nconclusive for purposes of removal.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right.\nCongress has removed the discretion in this class of\ncases and says that the courts must retain jurisdiction.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought maybe your\nanswer, one alternative answer, would have been that you\ncan't remand the case but you can still dismiss it.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the, perhaps,\nperhaps that's so. Certainly Carnegie-Mellon --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would still be\nconclusive for purposes of removal, but it doesn't mean\nit's conclusive for purposes of subject matter\njurisdiction.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: By its text, the\nstatute speaks to removal and that the Attorney\nGeneral's certification is conclusive for purposes of\nremoval. But I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Couldn't it be conclusive\nfor purposes of removal jurisdiction, but still leave\nthe district court with discretion to remand on the\ngrounds that, although it had removal jurisdiction, in\nfact the premise of that removal jurisdiction was wrong,\nand it would therefore remand, in effect, because the\nonly claim it had before it was the equivalent of a\npendent claim.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: But the -- as the\nCourt held in Carnegie-Mellon, a remand of pendent claims\nafter the Federal issue has been resolved is not a\nremand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction within\nthe meaning of 1447(c). Rather, it is a discretionary\nremand under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, and\nso --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In that case it would be\nreviewable.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: And it would be\nreviewable. That's why -- that's one of the reasons why\nthe district court's order here is reviewable, because\nit is not an order of remand authorized by 1447(c)\nbecause, first of all, Congress has instructed the\ncourts that they are not to remand.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's, that's what the\ndistrict court said it was, though, isn't it? Didn't it\n-- wasn't the district court remanding for lack of\njurisdiction?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It is certainly\ntrue that the district court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you want us to review\nthe, the assertion of the district court that it was\nremanding for, I mean that would mean every case would,\nwould be reviewable.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No, Your Honor,\nbecause here the Court need not go beyond the face of\nthe district court's order to understand what it was\ndoing. The court exercised jurisdiction over the\nFederal question that was properly brought before it by\nthe Attorney General's certification and this Court's\ndecision in Lamagno. After resolving that, the district\ncourt said, having concluded that the United States is\nnot a proper party to this case, the court must now\ndetermine whether or not it has jurisdiction, and it\nalso said that the absence of the U.S. as a party to the\ncase destroys the court's jurisdiction. So it's evident\nthat the court understood that it had jurisdiction and\nthat it was a subsequent event that deprived it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me go back to the\nChief Justice's hypo a little earlier. Could the\ndistrict judge at that point dismiss the case without\nprejudice to refiling in the State court?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I don't think that\nthat would be consistent with Congress's intent. The --\nin all of the Government --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It would be consistent\nwith the court having jurisdiction to dispose of the\ncase.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That is true. But\nI think that the intent of Congress was the same as this\nCourt, all the members of this Court, recognized in\nLamagno. In Lamagno, even the dissenters, the\nplurality, all acknowledged what Congress intended by\nthe \"conclusive for purposes of removal\" language was to\nprevent the shuttling back and forth of the case. Once\nit was removed, it was to stay in Federal court. That\nwas what Congress intended. And one reason --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then it's more than\npendent jurisdiction, because pendent jurisdiction\nleaves it up to the Federal court to either retain the\nState claim or send it back. So this is -- what you're\nsuggesting is something other than pendent jurisdiction.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. By\npendent jurisdiction what, what I meant to convey was\nthat it is within the Court's article III jurisdiction\nto exercise jurisdiction over the State law claims that\nwere pendent to a Federal claim. Under this Court's\njudicially developed doctrine of pendent jurisdiction,\nthat is discretionary with the court. But if it is\ndiscretionary with the court, then certainly Congress\ncan mandate that the court exercise that jurisdiction\nand that it would be consistent with article III.\nBut another reason why Congress would have\nwanted the case to remain in Federal court even if the\ncertification is overturned is, as we've alluded to\nbefore, the development of the case subsequent to the\ncertification substitution decision may, may illustrate\nthat the plaintiff's claim does indeed assert facts that\nwere within the scope of employment. The court would at\nthe very --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the\njurisdiction wouldn't depend on that. Justice Ginsburg's\npoint that there's more than pendent jurisdiction here I\ntake it is because these are not separate State claims\nappended to what you thought was a Federal claim. This\nis the same claim that you initially thought was a\nFederal claim and then it turned into a purely State law\nclaim, and that may be analyzed quite differently for\npurposes of jurisdiction.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No. The case is I\nthink not distinguishable from removals under the\nFederal Officer Removal statute, where Congress has\nindicated that it is the Federal defense that confers\njurisdiction rather than the Federal claim. Then, the\nultimate merits of the Federal defense are irrelevant to\nthe jurisdictional issue. And the Court --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying there are\ntwo claims, one claim is raised by the defense, and if\nyou look at that claim which is by definition Federal,\nthen it's fair to look at the original State claim by\nanalogy as a pendent claim?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that fair?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What happens if the\nAttorney General doesn't certify and it goes to State\ncourt? I take it one of the concerns we have here is\nthat there will be a deprivation of jury trial if the\ncertification is wrong and if it's in Federal court.\nSuppose that there is a denial of certification. Then\nunder (d)(3) --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: (D)(3).\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the employee can ask\nfor a certification decision. I take it that's a\nFederal law defense that the, or a Federal law\npoint, that the State court must hear and so now we're\nback in State court?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And we still don't have a\njury trial and if that's so I'm not sure if that helps\nyou or helps the Petitioner.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I think that\nYour Honor's point illustrates that this issue of Federal\nlaw is one that Congress has mandated be resolved at the\noutset by the judge, and if the employee petitions for\ncertification over the Attorney General's objection the\nstatute allows the Attorney General to remove the\npetition to Federal court and the statute states that\nthe district court shall find and certify whether the\nemployee was acting within the scope.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But in my case I guess I\ndon't think it ever gets to district court because\nthere's no certification, but then the employee can ask\nthe State court to have a bench trial on the scope of\nemployment. Am I right about that?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: He can, you are\ncorrect. It is at the option of the Attorney General\nunder (d)(3) to remove the case at that point so that\nthe review of his noncertification happens in Federal\ncourt. (D)(3), in stark contrast to (d)(2), provides\nthat if the district court holds that the Attorney\nGeneral was correct that the employee was not acting\nwithin the scope the case is to be remanded to State\ncourt. So the presence of the remand --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But my point is I suppose\nthe Government can just say, we're not going to make the\ncertification and we're not going to remove.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So then the State court\nstill has to have the bench trial on the scope of\nemployment.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure if that helps.\nIt seems to me that might be an argument for limiting\nthe inquiry just so that we can avoid having bench\ntrials in almost every case.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The -- I think what\nthat illustrates is that Congress wanted the issue of\nimmunity resolved at the outset of the case by the\ncourt. And one reason that that is so essential under\nthe Westfall Act FTCA scheme is that if the immunity --\nif the scope of employment issue is resolved in favor of\nthe employee, that has many, many consequences,\nincluding that the United States is the proper\ndefendant, exclusive jurisdiction lies in the Federal\ncourt, the case must be dismissed until an\nadministrative claim is filed and that avenue is\nexhausted.\nAll of these procedural and substantive\ndefenses come into play depending on how the scope of\nemployment issue is resolved.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right, but that's the\nstrongest argument I thought the other way initially,\nthat suppose the issue is whether he is on a frolic of\nhis own. That you resolve in a bench trial. If the\nanswer he was, okay, it stays in the Federal court\nanyway. I understand that.\nBut if you're going to take your position\nwhether, say, it's a sexual assault as it was in Wood\nand the question is well, was there a sexual assault or\nnot, and if there was it's clearly outside of the scope\nof employment, well, then you're going to have all these\nthings resolved in a bench trial and actually it's\nsupposed to normally be before a jury, for example.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that so? If the\nemployee is resubstituted, it's going on now, the United\nStates is not a party, just the Federal employee, but\nit's staying in Federal court under this pendent\njurisdiction-like theory, wouldn't either party be\nentitled to a jury trial?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes. Yes, Your\nHonor. I think Justice Breyer's question, though, had\nto do with the procedure at the certification review\nstage. That is to be done by the district court sitting\nwithout jury and that's because under the statute the\nAttorney General's certification has the legal effect of\nmaking the United States the defendant. The United\nStates -- the action shall be deemed an action against\nthe United States and the United States shall be\nsubstituted, and that is true unless and until the\ncertification is overturned. And there is of course no\nSeventh Amendment right to jury trial against the United\nStates.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Grant, could I come\nback for -- I'm sorry. I have the wrong counsel. Mr.\nHallward-Driemeier --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I'll respond to\nanything, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is your response to\nthe application of 1447(d)? You say that it does not\napply where it's apparent on the face that the remand is\nimproper?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That the remand was\nnot one of the remands authorized by 1447(c) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right, right.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Not just that it\nwas erroneous.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wouldn't somebody always be\nable to bring an appeal asserting that to be the case --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And wouldn't that destroy\nthe whole purpose of 1447(d), which is to stop this\nping-pong?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No, Your Honor, I\nthink not. And we have two arguments that both the\nissues, substitution and remand, are appealable. One is\na very specific one and that is that Congress has\ncategorically taken this kind of remand outside the\ncourt's authority under 1447(c) by specifically\nprohibiting remand at all in 2679(d)(2), and that\nargument of course would not have relevance, I don't\nthink, much beyond this case. And this Court has\nrecognized that Congress can exempt a certain class of\norders from the scope of 47(c) and (d) without\ncross-referencing those provisions. In the Rice case,\nthe Court said that that specific removal provision did\nnot purport to impair or restrict the application of the\nthen equivalents of 747(c) and (d). But clearly\n2679(d)(2) does purport to impair the authority to\nremand by making the certification conclusive for\npurposes of removal. So with that as our narrowest\nargument --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the response to that is\nthat our opinions show that even an erroneous remand is\nnonetheless governed by 1447(d). There are a lot of\nerroneous remands and this would just be, just be\nanother one.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: But when Congress\nspecifically prohibited the courts from remanding a case\nunder 2679(d)(2) it certainly did not mean to protect a\ncourt that ignored that mandate from review.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the problem, and\nmaybe I'm missing, and I may be missing something here,\nbut isn't the problem with your argument is that the\nstatute didn't come out and say you can't remand. The\nstatute said, for purposes of removal, the certification\nis conclusive, and that allows for the kind of dichotomy\nthat you and I were talking with before. A court can\nsay look, I know that I have article III jurisdiction\nhere, but in point of fact I am, I am remanding because\nwhat you and I are calling here the pendent claim does\nnot support any of the Government's theory. If that's\nthe case, then under 1447(d), there could be a review of\nit because it was not a jurisdictional ruling. But if\non the contrary, the judge said, as I think the judge\nsaid here, I am remanding because based on this\nanalysis, I do not have jurisdiction, i.e., the judge\nwent against the statute saying that jurisdiction is\nconclusive. That is an erroneous jurisdictional ruling,\nand as Justice Scalia said, we have said over and over\nagain, however erroneous it may be, it is not\nreviewable.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: If I may, Your\nHonor? I think, two things: One, that there is a\ndifference between Congress categorically prohibiting a\ncertain kind of remand, and saying that a remand was\nsimply erroneous. And secondly, that that argument\nwould not go to our argument that under Waco, at the\nvery least, the order on substitution is appealable,\nbecause it is separate and independent from remand.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Grant, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC GRANT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GRANT: Thank you. As to jurisdiction,\nCongress knows how to make an exception to section\n1447(d). All of the examples cited by the Court in\nKircher, and by the Government in its brief,\nspecifically referred, used the terms appeal and remand.\nThe statute here contains neither of those terms.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there was\nnothing expressed about Thermtron, and yet we recognized\nan exception there.\nMR. GRANT: Your Honor, Thermtron was a case\nwhere the district court did not even purport to be\nrelying on one of the grounds enumerated in section\n1447(c), namely lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In\nthis case, of course, the district court explicitly\ncited both that statute and used the term subject matter\njurisdiction, and the Government itself is, is not\nwilling to go behind that. On the merits, the\nGovernment has argued this morning that the Westfall Act\nprovides a Federal forum to assert a Federal defense of\nimmunity. The Government has analogized this statute\nto section 1442(a), which allows the assertion of a\ncolorable Federal defense, but the defense of, he didn't\ndo it, it never happened, is not a Federal defense. It\nis not a defense of immunity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the defense of,\nI was on the job and everything I did on the job was\nwithin the scope of my employment?\nMR. GRANT: In certain cases, Your Honor,\nthat could be a defense of immunity, but in a class of\ncases identified by Justice Breyer, there will be an\nadmission. There has to be an admission under the facts\nand the law, that even if the alleged acts occurred, it\nwas outside the scope of employment. In that case, the\ndefense is purely a merits defense. And I think for\nthis Court to say otherwise in this case would require\noverruling, or being contradictory to over 20 years of\nofficial immunity jurisprudence, where the Court has\nconsistently distinguished between immunity defenses and\ndefenses on the merits, where certainly the lower courts\nhave taken that conceptual distinction and said a\ndefense that the alleged acts did not occur do not raise\nan immunity defense. And so, the assertion of a defense\nin that case on the merits is not the assertion of a\nFederal defense. It is not sufficient to confer Federal\njurisdiction under article III. It does not meet the\ndefinition of a statute, of the statute, which uses the\nphrase \"scope of employment\" no fewer than seven times.\nThere is no indication that Congress in the Westfall Act\nintended to change the normal rules that purely State\nlaw defenses such as he didn't do it were to be decided\nin a Federal forum.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you're left with\nthis question Justice Scalia raised. If it's ambiguous,\nan employee says I did everything within the scope of my\nemployment, I did nothing improper. They allege I did\nsomething improper. I didn't. I was a faithful\nservant. The negligent employee will be allowed the\nFederal forum, but the one who was a loyal, careful\nemployee has to be in the State court. Does that make\nany sense?\nMR. GRANT: Your Honor, I think that's, with\nrespect, a misunderstanding of how the statute works.\nThe employee who acts within the scope of his\nemployment, whether or not he did the acts alleged, gets\nimmunity. The employee who acts outside of the scope of\nemployment --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is an employee who\nsaid I never did one thing that was inconsistent with my\nFederal employment.\nMR. GRANT: That's an employee who should\nwin on the merits and will win on the merits. As\nJustice Kennedy recognized, there are certain\napplications that allow the State court to resolve even\na Federal defense. We should trust that State courts\nwill resolve State law defenses in a manner fair to\ntheir own citizens as well.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
