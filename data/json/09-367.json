        "content": "(10:11 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument first this morning in Case 09-367, Dolan v.\nUnited States.\nMs. Karlan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. KARLAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe Mandatory Victim Restitution Act makes\nrestitution a mandatory part of a defendant's sentence\nfor certain crimes, and it sets out two paths by which a\ndistrict court can meet its responsibilities.\nFirst, section 3663A(a)(1) authorizes\ndistrict courts to impose restitution when sentencing a\ndefendant; that is, at the same time that they impose\nterms of imprisonment, fines, probation, or the like.\nSecond, section 3664(d)(5) of the Act allows final\ndetermination of the amount of restitution to occur\nduring a period not to exceed 90 days.\nOnce those periods and the general deadlines\nfor correcting or appealing a sentence have passed, a\ncourt's judgment is final, even if it fails to order\nrestitution. In this, the Mandatory Victim Restitution\nAct is like all other mandatory sentencing provisions,\nand as this Court confirmed 2 years ago in Greenlaw v.\nUnited States, when a court fails to impose a mandatory\nsentence, that error can be corrected only by following\nwhat this Court called the dispositive direction\nregarding sentencing errors.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. Is your\nargument that if the district court -- for whatever\nreason, unlikely as it may be -- starts a hearing the\nday after the rest of the sentence was imposed and has\nto continue that hearing for 91 days before it can\nrender a judgment --\nMS. KARLAN: No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that it's now barred\nfrom entering that judgment?\nMS. KARLAN: No. If I understand your\nquestion correctly, the district court has imposed\nsentence on day one announcing imprisonment. Any time\nduring the next 90 days, it has a power to set a date\nand make final determination of the restitution amount.\nOnce that 90-day period has run -- in this case, on\nOctober 28th, because the sentencing occurred on\nJuly 30th -- the district court loses the authority to\nimpose restitution.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the sentence is not\nfinal until then?\nMS. KARLAN: That's our position.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and what if -- what\nif the court does set a date for additional sentencing?\nThen it's not final until then, right?\nMS. KARLAN: No, Justice Scalia. It would\nbe that once a court has started the sentencing process,\nit has 90 days within which to complete that process, if\nit announces at the initial sentencing that it intends\nto hold open the sentence for final determination of\nrestitution.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I'm not sure I\nunderstood your response to my question. It must impose\nthat restitution order, complete all its proceedings\nwithin the 90-day period?\nMS. KARLAN: Yes, that's correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it can't hold a\nhearing over from the 90th day to the 91st day?\nMS. KARLAN: No, it cannot do that. And if\nit were to do that in a case where restitution were\nmandatory, the sentence would become final, the\ngovernment would file an appeal, and that appeal would\ncertainly succeed, because it's plain error not to have\nto imposed the restitution.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Your position is that if the\ncourt puts off the order of restitution for 90 days,\nduring that period, the defendant cannot take an appeal?\nMS. KARLAN: If the court has announced at\nthe initial sentencing that it intends to do so, no, then\nit cannot.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that dramatically\ncontrary to the way criminal appeals have been handled\nfor a long time? There's a very short period of time\nfor a defendant to file a notice of appeal in a criminal\ncase, and you're saying that that is dramatically\nextended by the possibility of -- of restitution later\non or by the fact that the restitution order will be\nentered later?\nMS. KARLAN: No, Justice Alito. What I'm\nsaying is that a defendant can only appeal from a final\nsentence, and until the restitutionary term is imposed\nwithin the time period allowed by the MVRA, there is not\na final sentence. Then he has from the time that\nrestitution is --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes, I understand that. But\nyou're saying the defendant is -- the defendant is\nincarcerated, let's say; is convicted, is sentenced to\nprison. The defendant wants to take a quick appeal.\nThe defendant thinks he's going to win on appeal. And\nyou're saying, well, no, you have to wait 90 days\nbefore you can file your notice of appeal?\nMS. KARLAN: I believe that's correct,\nbecause he has to have a final judgment before he can\nappeal.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what -- what do you\ndo about the further provision that at any time later,\nif the government -- or the victim finds additional\nbasis for restitution, so long as after discovering it,\nwithin 60 days after that, the victim can come to the\ncourt and ask for restitution? What does that do?\nDoes that --\nMS. KARLAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, doesn't that\nnecessarily mean that there are indeed two final\njudgments? That -- that one has to be -- has to go up\non its own, doesn't it?\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct, but section\n3664(o) of the statute says that the initial restitution\namount constitutes a final judgment, even though there\ncan be amendment after it's been entered.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that?\nMS. KARLAN: In our brief, it's on page --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. Oh -- \"a sentence that\nimposes an order\" --\nMS. KARLAN: It's on page --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- \"is a final judgment,\nnotwithstanding the fact that\" --\nMS. KARLAN: Yes, petition appendix 60a.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Got you.\nMS. KARLAN: So that's why that has to be in\nthere, because otherwise the defendant really would be\nin the position that Justice Alito --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any circuit\ncourt who has addressed this issue of when an appeal is\ntimely, in a situation in which a restitution order has\nnot been entered at the initial sentencing?\nMS. KARLAN: Not in precisely that way.\nThere are a couple of cases that are -- that kind of\ncircle around that.\nSo for example, Kapelushnik, which we cite\nin our petition for certiorari and in our brief as the\nwisest way of thinking about this, held that once the\n90 days has lapsed, the judgment is final by operation\nof law.\nThere's an opinion by Judge Posner in the\nSeventh Circuit that's not on restitution but on a\nrelated issue, which says that if you have several\ncomponents to the sentence, until that last component is\nentered, the time for filing an appeal under F.R.A.P. 4\ndoes not begin to run. And that's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In this -- when the\njudge did not enter a date for restitution, did you\nobject to that?\nMS. KARLAN: We were not required to do so,\nso we did not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why not? It\nseems that that's when the violation occurred. The\nstatute said the court shall set a date if they're not\nready to calculate the restitution, and he didn't do\nthat.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, that's correct,\nMr. Chief Justice, but the statute doesn't say when he\nhas to set the date. The statute simply says the date\nhas to be set so that final restitution will occur\nduring the period -- and here I quote again from the\nstatute -- \"not to exceed 90 days.\" So he can set that\ndate once he gets the information from --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought it\nsays -- maybe I am misreading it. It says the court --\nthis is at sentencing. When sentencing -- you look at\nthe previous provision -- what is it? 3663A(a)(1) --\nMS. KARLAN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- talks about what\nyou do when sentencing it.\nMS. KARLAN: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the statute\nsays, \"the court shall set a date for the final\ndetermination\" ... \"not to exceed 90 days.\" And he didn't.\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct, he did not set\nit. But the statute -- I'm now looking at petition\nappendix 55a, which is where section 3664(d)(5) of the\nAct is set out. It says, \"The court shall set a date\nfor the final determination of the victim's losses, not\nto exceed 90 days after sentencing.\"\nThe 90 days modifies the final\ndetermination. It doesn't modify the setting of the\ndate. So within that 90-day period, I think\nthat what was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I think that's\nright. I -- I agree with you that.\nMS. KARLAN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, the\nfinal determination -- the date for the -- the final\ndetermination can't exceed 90 days --\nMS. KARLAN: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- but that doesn't\nmean that the provision saying the court shall set a date\ncan wait -- that he can wait 89 days to do that.\nMS. KARLAN: No, I think it would be very\nunwise for a district court to do that, but the court\ncan't really set the date until it receives the\ninformation that it hopes to receive from the probation\noffice or from the victim. So that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It can say 90 days. It\ncan say 90 days.\nMS. KARLAN: It -- it could, yes. Or it\ncould say, as the district court did here, I'm going to\nhold open the date. But it can only hold open that date\nuntil the point at which it actually imposes the\nrestitution, within the 90 days.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is a -- this is, in\none respect, Ms. Karlan, a technical argument, is it\nnot? Because it's true that this defendant, from the\nprobation officer's report, knew within the 90 days what\nrestitution was going to be recommended.\nMS. KARLAN: Yes. He knew within the\n90 days what the government's claim was going to be, but\nthe court did not hold the hearing and did not impose\nthe judgment. And so the August 8th judgment became\nfinal by operation of law on October 28th, because that\nwas 90 days after the July 30th sentencing.\nAt that point, the government could have\nfiled an appeal in this case, and, quite frankly, they\nwould have won. As it was --\nJUSTICE ALITO: How is your position -- how\nis your position consistent with the thrust of the\nvictims' rights legislation that Congress has enacted in\nrecent years, including the statute that's before us\nhere?\nNow, in this case, the victim -- the\nvictim's medical bills were paid by the United States.\nBut that isn't always going to be the case, and\nsometimes victims are going to have a lot of lost\nincome. So you have the victim, like the victim here,\nwho is beaten to a pulp by a defendant and loses a\nsubstantial amount of future income as a result, and you\nsay that if the judge makes a mistake, it's just too bad\nfor the victim. The victim gets nothing because the\njudge waited too long.\nMS. KARLAN: No, I don't --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that's what\nCongress had in mind?\nMS. KARLAN: I don't say that, and I don't\nthink that's what Congress had in mind. First, what\nCongress had in mind was to strike the balance it struck\nin this statute, which was to give victims the right to\nreceive restitution as part of a criminal sentence, as\nlong as it was done within 90 days of sentencing.\nSecond, the government can appeal if a court\ndoesn't follow the rules.\nThird --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes, but wasn't -- wasn't\nthe whole thrust of the victims' rights legislation that\nup to that point, Congress thought prosecutors were not\nsufficiently attending to the rights and the interests\nof victims? They were doing their own prosecutorial\nthing, but they weren't involving victims, making sure\nthey knew about court proceedings, and so forth.\nAnd you're saying, well, if the court makes\na mistake and the prosecution falls down in its\nresponsibility, the person who suffers is the victim who\ngets victimized again.\nMS. KARLAN: No, that's not what I'm saying.\nWhat I'm saying is Congress struck a balance. They\nwanted to give restitution to victims. They also wanted\nfinal sentencing for defendants. Congress struck that\nbalance by giving a 90-day extension. It didn't provide --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're not\nreally -- you're not really answering Justice Alito's\nquestion. He says he understands that, as I understand\nthe question. We understand that argument.\nBut it doesn't address the fact that the net\nresult of your argument is (a) unfair to the victim and\n(b) inconsistent with the whole design and thrust of the\nVictims Act.\nMS. KARLAN: It's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you, it seems to me,\nhave to say: So be it; the technical rule prevails.\nThat's too bad.\nI mean, that's your argument, it seems\nto me.\nMS. KARLAN: No, my argument is Congress\nstruck that balance, and in some cases, yes, too bad --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, the same thing\nwould happen if the trial judge makes a mistake of law\nwhich causes the -- the defendant to be acquitted, so\nthat he not only escapes the liability to the victim, he\nescapes any -- any criminal punishment. It happens all\nthe time. The judge makes a mistake; society pays for\nit.\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct, and Congress\nhere has said 90 days. And they meant it. If they had\nmeant to say, at any time, a victim can receive\nrestitution, they would have said that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But Congress says -- to\nparaphrase and not get it accurate -- that the\nDepartment of Transportation shall enact a rule\ngoverning tire safety within 9 months from the\neffective date of this legislation. And the Department\nof Transportation fails to do that. It doesn't\npromulgate its law for 18 months. Is that law invalid?\nThe rule?\nMS. KARLAN: No, generally, under this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course, it isn't.\nMS. KARLAN: Because that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So how is this different?\nMS. KARLAN: Well, this is a criminal\nsentencing statute which is different than a civil\nagency action.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I understand that point.\nI'm just asking what's a relevant difference?\nMS. KARLAN: That is the incredibly relevant\ndifference, for the following reason --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMS. KARLAN: -- that finality in sentencing\nis important, because otherwise a defendant cannot even\nappeal his conviction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why couldn't he?\nMS. KARLAN: Because he --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You just read us the\nprovision.\nMS. KARLAN: It's not a final --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The judge enters a -- an\norder, a final order. And that final judgment, as was\ntrue here, says: I haven't decided restitution yet. He\ncan appeal. Then what it says is when you get around to\nthe restitution, then enter another judgment, and you'll\nappeal that, as happens precisely in the case of\nthe 60 days -- you know, that extra stuff that Justice\nScalia was referring to. That's a possible\ninterpretation of the Federal Rules of Appellate\nProcedure. I don't see, you know, the appeals thing. I\ndon't see anything -- I don't have in front of me the\nlanguage on filing an appeal, but I can't think of\nanything that's contrary.\nMS. KARLAN: What's contrary to that is\nthat the Federal courts of appeals only have\njurisdiction to decide cases that come up, in criminal\ncases, on final judgment or under the collateral order.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's right.\nMS. KARLAN: This is not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's a final judgment, and\nbecause there is another provision that says an order of\nrestitution is itself a final judgment.\nMS. KARLAN: No. With all respect,\nJustice Breyer, there is no provision that says an order\nof restitution --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You read it to us. I mean\nthe one you read to us.\nMS. KARLAN: No. That says --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What?\nMS. KARLAN: -- that a sentence that\nincludes a term of restitution can be a final judgment,\neven though that 60-day provision to which\nJustice Scalia pointed is on the books.\nBut you can't have a final judgment in a\ncriminal case that involves several different components\nof a sentence until those aspects of the sentence have\nactually been imposed.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why isn't the --\nMS. KARLAN: Justice Scalia, I believe, was\nreferring to the 60-day provision.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, the same problem.\nMS. KARLAN: The 60-day provision is\nspecifically immunized from the final judgment rule by\nsection 3664(o) of the statute. The 90-day provision is\nnot. So until a defendant -- perhaps I could -- perhaps\nI could use a slightly different example, which is:\nSuppose a defendant is supposed to be a sentenced to a\nfine, a mandatory fine --\nJUTICE BREYER: I see.\nMS. KARLAN: -- and a mandatory prison sentence.\nIf you sentence him to the mandatory prison sentence and\nsay I still need to calculate the fine -- there is no\nfinal judgment. He cannot appeal that sentence.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But isn't there a difference\nbetween those two situations? A fine is a criminal\npenalty. It goes -- it -- the prosecution is brought in\nthe same of the sovereign. The fine goes to the\nsovereign. It's a traditional criminal penalty.\nRestitution is not a traditional criminal\npenalty. It's much like, arguably, attorneys' fees in a\ncivil case. It is -- it is like -- it is really a -- a\nbenefit for the victim. It is not something that inures\nto the benefit of the sovereign.\nAnd so why doesn't it make sense to view\nthat judgment of restitution as a separate judgment,\njust as the award of an attorney's fees is a separate\nfinal appealable order in a civil case?\nMS. KARLAN: Well, because this judgment of\nrestitution is not a civil judgment. It is part of the\ndefendant's criminal punishment, and, therefore, it is\nnot like attorneys' fees, something that's separate.\nAs we point out in our reply brief, in order\nto calculate the amount of imprisonment, in order to\ncalculate the fine, the Federal criminal sentencing\nprovisions -- and I should note that section 3664(a)\nappears in Title 18 in the section under miscellaneous\nsentencing provisions, not civil provisions. All of\nthose things interact. And so you can't calculate one\nof those without knowing all of them.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, functionally, isn't\nit a substitute for the remedy that the victim of a\ncrime might have? Wasn't what Congress was trying to do\nwas to spare the victim the necessity of suing the\ndefendant and having his kind of civil restitution\ntacked onto the criminal proceeding?\nMS. KARLAN: That's certainly Congress's\npurpose, but they did it within the context of\nsentencing. So, for example, Justice Ginsburg, if this\nreally were a civil penalty, defendants would not be\nentitled to the assistance of counsel in challenging the\namount of restitution, because the Sixth Amendment would\nnot apply. The dates for filing an appeal would be\ndifferent. There would be a jurisdictional bar that\ndoesn't exist in criminal cases.\nThis Court said several times that\nrestitution under these kinds of circumstances -- in\nHughey, under the predecessor to this Act, and in Kelly\nv. Robinson -- is a penal statute. Justice Sotomayor in\nher opinion for the Second Circuit in Varrone said this\nis a penal statute.\nSo there is no question here that this is a\nsubstitute for a civil remedy or a supplement for a\ncivil remedy, but it is a criminal punishment. And\nCongress has said that you have to order it at\nsentencing or within 90 days, or else it is error that\ncan be corrected through Rule 35 or by appeal, but not\notherwise.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, what -- what can the\ndefendant do within that 90 days? He has to wait\n90 days before he appeals the sentence that he has been\ngiven; is that right?\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct. There is not a\nfinal judgment in his case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's 3 months that --\nthat he has to sit on his hands.\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that?\nMS. KARLAN: Well, the final judgment rule\nsays that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, this is a court-made\nrule of what counts as a final judgment.\nMS. KARLAN: Right. And -- and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Is there\nanything in the decisions of this Court interpreting\nthat rule? I mean, you could have collateral orders. You\ncould have all kinds of things. And doesn't it boil down\nto the same question?\nI mean, I agree with you that if Congress\nwanted to make a 90-day deadline, you really have to do\nit, and you can't restitute thereafter. All right.\nThat's one thing. But if they didn't, why didn't they\nequally intend the judgment without the restitution\norder to be a final judgment?\nMS. KARLAN: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then later on, just as\nin (o), if the judge does impose an order of restitution,\nthen of course, that's appealable, and that's a different\njudgment. Is there -- what in the law prevents the --\nthat interpretation?\nMS. KARLAN: I think two things prevent that\ninterpretation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMS. KARLAN: One is this Court's precedent,\nand let me talk about that. And two is a proper reading\nof section 3664(o). So I'll turn first to the\nprecedent and then to 3664(o).\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you have precedent.\nMS. KARLAN: So the precedent is, for\nexample, this Court said in Parr v. United States, which\nis cited on page 12 of the reply brief, among other\nplaces, that \"a judgment or decision is final for purpose\nof appeal only when it terminates the litigation between the\nparties on the merits of the case, and leaves nothing to\nbe done but to enforce by execution what has been determined.\"\nUntil restitution has been determined, a\ncase does not fit within Parr. Parr is, I believe, an\ninterpretation of 1291, 28 U.S.C. 1291, which is the\nprovision that gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you can -- under\nyour view, you can change the amount of jail time up to\nthe point at which you have to set the restitution. The\njudge says: I'm going to sentence you to 3 years, and\nI'm going to figure out the restitution.\nHe looks, and the restitution turns out to\nbe a lot more than he thought. So he says: Well, I'm\nonly going to give you 2 years. Or it's less, and he\nsays: I'm going to give you 4 years.\nBecause the judgment is still open, he can\ndo that?\nMS. KARLAN: I believe, Your Honor, that he\ncan. And the reason for that is the sentencing statute\nitself -- 18 U.S.C. section 3553, I believe it is --\ntalks about how a court, in sentencing a defendant, is\nsupposed to be considering all of these penalties and\nhow they interact with one another.\nSo if a defendant can make restitution to a\nvictim by, for example, being put on community release\nor probation rather than serving time in prison, a court\ncan take that into account in setting the sentence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Must take it into account --\nMS. KARLAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- if you read 3553 the way\nit's written.\nMS. KARLAN: Yes, I think they must take it\ninto account. Now, whether -- how they'll actually\nstrike that balance is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there no -- is there\nno possibility that a judge could say: I want to make\nthis analogous to 54(b) under the civil rules; that is,\nI don't want to delay the time that the defendant can\nappeal from the -- from the -- from the sentence. So\nthis order is final, and 3 months later, I'll take up\nthe question of restitution when all the information is\nin. The court is prevented from doing that?\nMS. KARLAN: I'm unaware of any criminal\nrules analogue to Rule 54(b) in the civil context, because\nin general, as I understand the way this Court's\nprecedents have worked, there have been what might look\nlike interlocutory appeals in criminal cases, but they've\nalways involved collateral issues.\nAnd the problem here, for the reason that\nJustice Scalia just pointed to, is restitution and the\namount of imprisonment are not collateral to one\nanother; that is, they may interact. And a fine\ncertainly isn't, because the statute itself says you\ncan't impose a fine to the extent that it will impair\nrestitution. So if --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So the judge -- but the\njudge could say -- once she thinks she needs -- that\nthey need time for more information: I'm going to\ndefer the whole sentencing. So, Defendant, you'll have to\nwait 3 months to find out how much time you're going to\nserve. That would be all right. You could use the\n90-day period to extend the time for imposing the\nsentence.\nWell, in effect, you're saying the sentence\nisn't final, so she could change it any time within the\n90 days?\nMS. KARLAN: There's a slight complication\nthere, but I think the answer to your question is yes;\nthat is, the judge could delay the entire sentencing\nunder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.\nLook, we're not saying that you couldn't\nget restitution in a case like this. We're simply\nsaying that you have to follow the rules.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, what about\nthat as a possible answer? If we accept -- the -- the judge,\nof course, could say to the defendant: I'm not going to\nsentence you; I'm not going to put that sentence -- I'm\nnot going to sentence you at all --\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- for 100 days.\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And your remedy, then,\nmight be to ask for mandamus, if that was too long a\nperiod?\nMS. KARLAN: It -- it might be. I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- and -- so why\nwouldn't that be similar here? If the judge is going to\ngo after the 90 days, he'd have the power to do it,\nbut it would be like a continuance, and he'd have to\nexercise that reasonably.\nMS. KARLAN: Because you have to follow the\nrules as laid down.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I know. You're\ninterpreting it literally, and --\nMS. KARLAN: Yes. Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and that's --\nMS. KARLAN: -- that is, there are many\nmechanisms for ensuring that a victim --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I mean, if I thought,\nfor argument's sake --\nMS. KARLAN: You can't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that Congress doesn't care about\nwhether it's after 90 days -- it was just to sort of\nspeed things up -- on that assumption, wouldn't you\nstill have a remedy, because it would be like the\nunreasonable continuance?\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That is correct? I've got\nit?\nMS. KARLAN: If -- if you -- you can't have\na continuance from the 90 days. You can have a\ncontinuance --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I'm thinking of --\nMS. KARLAN: -- of sentencing itself.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm thinking of the\ngeneral problems --\nMS. KARLAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- of continuances for\nsentencing.\nMS. KARLAN: Yes, that's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And your argument is that\n90 days is long enough?\nMS. KARLAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I've got it.\nMS. KARLAN: And I'd like to reserve the\nremainder --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you one\nquestion?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I have a question going\njust to that. It seems to me that if 3553, as -- as I said\n-- maybe you shouldn't have agreed -- requires the\nsentencing court to consider the totality of the\nsentence it's imposing, including the restitution,\nthat would mean that the judge cannot impose a sentence\nbefore the expiration of the 90 days; that is, has to\nwait until the restitutionary issue is resolved to\nimpose the incarceration part of the sentence. No?\nMS. KARLAN: I think the way that the\nstatute is written contemplates that the judge will do\nthe regular sentencing at which he imposes these other\nterms, but may keep it open for 90 days.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question\nbefore you sit down? Are you aware -- maybe you cite\nthem in the briefs and I didn't catch it -- of any cases\nin which the courts -- a court of appeals has\ndismissed an appeal because it was taken before the --\nthe civil remedy had been imposed?\nMS. KARLAN: I'm not aware of a case that\ndoes that directly under the Mandatory Victims\nRestitution Act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Heytens.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TOBY J. HEYTENS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HEYTENS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nTo begin by addressing the question just\nraised by Justice Stevens, the government agrees that we\nare not aware of any cases that directly confront this\nfinality question. There are, however, at least four\ncases in the courts of appeals where one of two things\nhappened: Either the defendant took an appeal from the\noriginal term of his imprisonment, then later took an\nappeal from the order of restitution and the appeals\nwere consolidated. That happened, among other things,\nin the Cheal case, which is the First Circuit decision\ncited in our brief. There are at least two other\ncircuit court cases that do that as well.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was it within the 90 days?\nMR. HEYTENS: No. It --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The restitution sentence\nwas after the 90 days?\nMR. HEYTENS: That's correct,\nJustice Scalia. Now --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In those -- in those -- in\nthat case, or any of those four cases, did they discuss\nthe problem of whether there was -- both appeals were\nproper?\nMR. HEYTENS: Justice Stevens, I'm not\naware of any case that squarely --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They just went ahead and\nconsolidated?\nMR. HEYTENS: That's correct, Justice\nStevens. I'm not aware of any case that directly\nconfronts this issue. Now --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under your view of\nthings, however, that's fortuity that the underlying\nconviction was still in the appeal process, because\nthere is no statute of limitations under your reading.\nA victim could come 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 100 years\nlater and say: I'm entitled to restitution.\nMR. HEYTENS: The statute --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And absent prejudice to\nthe defendant, that would be okay?\nMR. HEYTENS: Absent prejudice or some sort\nof double jeopardy problem, that's correct. The\nstatute, by its terms, says as long as the victim comes\nforward within 60 days of the discovery of his losses,\n(d)(5) expressly says that the victim can do that. So I\nthink this --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, that's\n60 days after the restitution order has been issued. Am\nI --\nMR. HEYTENS: I believe that's incorrect,\nYour Honor. The provision that we're referring to,\nsubsection (d)(5), is reproduced on page 6A of the\nappendix to the government's brief. It's the, I\nbelieve, second sentence of (d)(5) that we're\ndiscussing right now that states: \"If the victim\nsubsequently discovers further losses, the victim shall\nhave 60 days after the discovery of those losses in\nwhich to petition the court for an amended restitution\norder.\"\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That 60 days says after\nthere has been an -- a restitution order. I'm positing\nthe situation where the victim comes 10 years later.\nMR. HEYTENS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That says there's no\nrestitution order. It's the initial action. And\nyou're saying that's okay? It's an endless statute?\nMR. HEYTENS: It is -- it is certainly not\nokay, Your Honor. Congress has directed that this\ndetermination must be made and that it must be made\nwithin 90 days. And Federal district courts are\nrequired to comply with that obligation.\nBut what Congress has not done is to specify\na consequence that occurs in the situation where the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it -- it -- it's sort\nof a ridiculous consequence that 5 years later, and\nthe judge who tried the original case is dead.\nI think it's bad enough to have the issue of\nwhether this victim suffered $100,000 damages\ndecided by the judge, if that's what you're going to be\nsentenced to, but at least it's being decided by the\njudge who tried the case. And under your proposal, it\ncan be decided by some other judge who is just -- just\npulled in, because the -- the trial judge has -- has\nbeen deceased. That doesn't seem to me to make any\nsense at all.\nMR. HEYTENS: Your Honor, I don't think it\nis our proposal. Congress has not specified -- Congress\nhas certainly required this to be done within 90 days.\nThat meant Congress wanted it to be done within 90 days.\nBut Congress has not specified a consequence for --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the\nconsequence is the usual consequence when trial courts\nmake errors, which is to appeal.\nMR. HEYTENS: Your Honor, I think this Court\nsaid in Montalvo-Murillo what the consequence is in this\ncategory of cases, which is when a trial court fails to\ncomply with a mandatory time limitation for doing\nsomething that the court is required to do, the remedy\nis -- unless Congress provides otherwise, such as it\ndoes in the Speedy Trial Act, the remedy is not a loss\nof the power on the part of the court to act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't the statute\nestablish time limits for filing an appeal?\nMR. HEYTENS: The statute does, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does it -- does it state a\nremedy for it? I don't think so. But if you don't\ncomply with the time limit, you're too late; you can't\nfile the appeal.\nMR. HEYTENS: Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Same thing here.\nMR. HEYTENS: There's a critical difference\nbetween a statute of limitations for filing a notice of\nappeal and what's happening here that's illustrated by\nthe example given by Judge Gorsuch in his opinion for\nthe courts of appeals.\nThere can be two kinds of time limits. The\nfirst kind can say, if you want to do something -- you're\nnot required to do it -- but if you want to do it,\nyou have to do it within a certain time. That's what a\nstatute of limitations is.\nThe second kind of time limit is to say you\nmust do something and you must do it within a second --\nwithin a certain amount of time. This case is the\nsecond category, just as the statute at issue in\nMontalvo-Murillo was in the second category of cases, and\njust as --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except that that was a\nbail question, where there's not issues of finality at\nplay, and bail is a question that repeats itself\nthroughout the proceedings. Defendants are denied bail\nand then make a different showing of other\nresources or less danger or whatever, and they get out.\nAnd vice versa, defendants are out and are put in.\nThat's it. There are no finality questions there.\nWhat do you do in this situation when you're\ndealing with a criminal sentence where there are\nfinality rules?\nAnd I'm going to tie that back to my starting\npoint, which is I'm looking in your brief for the\nprecedent and/or legal basis for us to treat restitution\nas not part of the final judgment in this criminal\naction. What -- what other examples do we have in the\ncriminal context?\nMR. HEYTENS: We cited the things we cite in\nour brief. There is, however, also a statute; I\napologize to the Court, it is not cited in our brief,\nbut it is section 18 U.S.C. section 3582(b). That\nprovision is captioned Imposition of a Sentence of\nImprisonment. Subsection (b) -- subsection (b) of that\nprovision says Effect of Finality of the Judgment. It\nthen says, \"Notwithstanding the fact that a sentence of\nimprisonment can subsequently be\" modified or altered in\ncertain ways, and then this is the critical language: \"a\njudgment of conviction that includes such a sentence\nconstitutes a final judgment for all other purposes.\"\nIn this case there was a judgment of\nconviction. It was entered on July 3, 2007. And that\njudgment of conviction imposed a sentence of\nimprisonment on Mr. Dolan.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, now suppose -- now\nwe're getting to exactly the point where I thought your\nco-counsel, your sister counsel had a good point that I\nwasn't -- hadn't thought through, and that is what\nhappens now in -- on day -- we're finished the\ntrial. The sentencing is over. They got the\npresentence report, and the judge enters -- suppose he\nentered a judgment but didn't say anything about\nrestitution, because he says: I'd like to give you a\nchance to appeal this. And I'm not going to deal with\nrestitution for a month when the victim recovers -- all\nwithin the 90 days.\nCan the defendant appeal that piece of\npaper?\nMR. HEYTENS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The answer is because of\nthis provision?\nMR. HEYTENS: We think because of that\nprovision and because of general principles of law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Whoa, whoa. What about\nwhat the -- what -- what you just heard quoted,\nforgetting this particular sentence in the code, was that\na judgment isn't final -- you can only appeal a final\njudgment until all the parts that are there, and the\nrestitution is part of it. And so until it's final, you\ncan't appeal it. That's what -- that's what the case\nParr, which it quoted. What is -- what is your response\nto that?\nMR. HEYTENS: That certainly establishes the\ngeneral rule that this Court has said repeatedly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. HEYTENS: -- that the jurisdiction of the\nFederal courts is established by Congress.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I just want to make\nclear where we are. Justice Breyer said, can the\ndefendant appeal? You said yes. Suppose he said, must\nthe defendant appeal?\nMR. HEYTENS: The defendant in our view is\nrequired to appeal --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Must?\nMR. HEYTENS: Once the district court enters\na judgment that imposes a sentence of imprisonment, if\nthe defendant wishes to appeal that sentence of\nimprisonment he has 14 days to do so following the entry\nof the judgment, yes, which is the normal rule in\nFederal criminal cases.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And if he misses --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Even though -- even though\nhe says the restitution shall be held in abeyance\npending receipt of information?\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, to the extent that he\nhas an objection to the district court's -- it depends\non the precise circumstances of the case, Justice\nKennedy. To the extent what he says is, I think the\ndistrict court needs to, when it imposes the sentence of\nrestitution, take into account the other aspects of the\nsentence, at that time the issues become interrelated.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me see if I understand\nthis. He has 14 days to appeal that. And if he doesn't\ndo that, then later within the 90 days or even after the\n90 days, a sentence of restitution is imposed, he can --\nhe can appeal that sentence of restitution, right?\nMR. HEYTENS: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: On the same grounds on\nwhich he would have appealed the -- the sentence of\nimprisonment, right?\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, it -- to the extent --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if it's an error in\nthe trial, he claims: I was innocent.\nMR. HEYTENS: No, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No?\nMR. HEYTENS: To the -- his time for\nappealing from the judgment of conviction runs from the\nentry of the judgment of conviction, which is\ncontemporaneous with the imposition of the sentence of\nimprisonment. If he wants to appeal that, he needs to do\nthat like any other --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I suppose it's no -- no\nimprisonment; it's supervised release. Now what\nhappens?\nMR. HEYTENS: If it's -- if the judge imposes a\nsentence of supervised release, I am not aware if there\nis a specific statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but I mean, what's\nbothering me about this, and I'm not aware -- but you're\nquoting a sentence that wasn't in your brief and what I\nhadn't taken in at all is the extent to which this is\ninextricably mixed up with the rules of appeals, which are\nvery important.\nSo unless I have in my own mind how -- how\nthis all fits together, I -- I don't know how to decide\nthis case. I don't want to say something in here that's\ngoing to muck up the -- the rules of appealing from a\ncriminal case.\nNow, what you've told me is I'm supposed to say\nthat within 14 days of a -- of a judgment imposing imprisonment,\nhe has to appeal, but of course if it's supervised release,\nhe doesn't, or I'm not sure.\nMR. HEYTENS: Justice Breyer, first and\nforemost, the Court doesn't need to say anything about\nany of these issues.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not?\nMR. HEYTENS: For one very simple reason:\nThe only thing that this defendant has ever attempted to\nappeal at any point is the order of restitution. He\nnever attempted to appeal from his guilty plea.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but if -- but I have\nto be able to write my reasons, and in doing that I have\nto respond to the argument of the other side, which is\nthat the strongest reason for thinking Congress intended\nthis to be final and not beyond 90 days is that if you\ndon't do that, you muck up the rules of appeal. Now,\nexplain to me why that isn't so.\nMR. HEYTENS: A couple of reasons, Your\nHonor: First of all, I think it's actually one of the\nstrongest arguments against their position, because it\ncreates the unlikely scenario where it will be\nroutinely -- we know that Congress has authorized these\ndeterminations to be made up to 90 days after the\nimposition of sentence. So their rule would create the\nsituation where it would be completely consistent with\nCongress's intent to routinely create a situation where\na Federal criminal defendant has to wait 3 months after\nsentencing until he can appeal.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which is just what you say\nhe has to do if the sentence is supervised release.\nMR. HEYTENS: What I'm saying, Justice\nBreyer, is I -- I -- I know there is a statute that\ngoverns imprisonment. I believe there is a similar\nstatute that governs a sentence of probation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was that statute on\nimprisonment?\nMR. HEYTENS: 18 U.S.C. 3582(b), Justice\nScalia. I know there is a statute that governs that.\nWe also know there is a statute governing a term of\nrestitution itself. That's the provision cited, 3664(o),\nwhich is reproduced at 11a of the appendix to our\nbrief --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I've got it.\nMR. HEYTENS: -- which is the rules\ngoverning finality with regard to an order imposing\nrestitution.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Heytens, one problem\nwith the -- we have said that notice of appeal -- that\nthat time limit is jurisdictional, which means if the\ndefendant misses that deadline, no appeal. And we're\nleaving this in a nebulous state if the judge says,\nwithin -- this is -- this is a judgment of conviction\nand sentence, but I'm still thinking about the\nrestitution.\nThe defendant has to know at that point,\nmust I appeal that first judgment? Because if I don't,\nI'll never be able to appeal it.\nBut on your reading, the defendant can't\nwait. When the judge imposes a sentence, the defendant\nmust meet the time clock for notice of appeal from the\nsentence.\nMR. HEYTENS: That's correct,\nJustice Ginsburg. In our view, the defendant -- when\nthe judgment of conviction was imposed on this case,\nwhich imposed a sentence of imprisonment on Mr. Dolan,\nthe time for appealing the judgment of conviction and\nthe term of imprisonment began to run.\nIf I could go back to Justice Breyer's\nquestion --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- that would\nmean even if the judge says, I'm going to impose the\nrestitution order 10 days from now, defendant's time\nclock for notice of appeal would begin at -- at the time\nthe sentence is imposed, not 10 days later when\nrestitution is --\nMR. HEYTENS: That's correct. He files a\nnotice of appeal when the judgment of conviction\nis entered, and then 10 days later he can file a second\nnotice of appeal, and courts of appeal can consolidate\nthat case in the ordinary course.\nYou don't -- to answer Justice Breyer's very\nspecific question about the supervised released, I have\nbeen advised that a district court cannot impose a term\nof supervised release unless it also imposes a sentence\nof imprisonment. So that particular hypothetical that\nJustice Breyer raised wouldn't arise. The court\ncan't just --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, let's --\nlet's suppose there's no 3664(d)(5), and we're back to\njust 363(a)(1), which says when sentencing a defendant,\nthe court shall order restitution. What if the\njudge doesn't -- is that mandatory? It has to be when\nsentencing the defendant?\nMR. HEYTENS: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nI think what --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think even\nwithout 3664(d)(5), the judge can say: I know it says\nwhen I'm sentencing I've got to order restitution.\nBut 2 months later, he can do it?\nMR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, let me\namend my answer slightly. He -- the judge is required\nto do it when sentencing --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but nothing\nhappens if he doesn't. Is that --\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, the question then\nbecomes one of a remedy. The court is required to do it,\nand the question becomes what is the remedy when the\ncourt does not. And what the Court said in\nMontalvo-Murillo is that we presume that Federal\ndistrict courts will comply with the law, and that it is\ninappropriate in situations where Congress doesn't\nspecify a remedy for courts to impose their own remedy.\nThat was exactly the situation in Montalvo-Murillo.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why don't we go back to my\nhypothetical --\nMR. HEYTENS: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and just substitute the\nword \"fine\" for \"supervised release.\"\nMR. HEYTENS: Justice Breyer, I'm -- I'm fairly\ncertain there is a statute that addresses the finality\nwhen it comes to a sentence that imposes a term of a\nfine, which is similar to the statute that addresses\nfinality of a judgment of conviction that imposes only\na term of imprisonment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not -- I'm not an\nexpert in this area, as you can see. And -- and I need\nto have a place to go to look so that I can see that\nthese things, in your view, all work out, and you're\nnot creating some odd appellate system. Do you have any\nsuggestions for me as to what I could go and read and\nlook at that would help me?\nMR. HEYTENS: Justice Breyer, to address\nyour very specific fine question, there is in fact a\nstatute that addresses that as well. That is 18 U.S.C.\n3572(c). It's structured very similarly to the -- the\nsection regarding judgments of imprisonment that I\nquoted to the Court earlier, and Congress has addressed\nthat. It says: \"Notwithstanding the fact that a\nsentence to pay a fine can subsequently be altered in\nvarious respects, a judgment that includes such a\nsentence is a final judgment for all other\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can the (o) -- you\nremember -- you know what I'm referring to by (o)?\nMR. HEYTENS: Yes, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Can that be\nread to refer to initial -- an initial judgment of\nrestitution as well as an amended judgment?\nMR. HEYTENS: Absolutely, Justice Breyer.\nThat's exactly what the First Circuit said in the Cheal\ncase, which is cited in our brief. The First Circuit in\nthat case addressed an initial judgment that said,\nsimilarly, somewhat, to the judgment in this one -- the\noriginal judgment, if you recall, in this case says the\nMandatory Victims Restitution Act is applicable;\nhowever, the court does not have sufficient information\nto calculate restitution at this time. What the First\nCircuit reasoned in Cheal is that that can be\ninterpreted as a judgment imposing a restitution\nobligation, which is thus final under subsection (o).\nIf you conclude that, you don't need to look at any\nother statute to resolve --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even though there's no\namount given?\nMR. HEYTENS: Yes, Justice Scalia. Because\nthe one thing we know for certain is that even if it had\nstated an amount, the fact that the amount can be amended\nlater doesn't deprive the judgment of finality.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Simply because when you\nstate an amount, that amount can be amended later, that\nleads to the conclusion that you need not even state an\namount? Do you do the same thing for imprisonment? You\nsay: I'm going to send you to prison; I'm not sure how\nmany years, but I'm going to send you to prison. Is\nthat appealable right away?\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, Justice Scalia, the\ndistrict court is not permitted to do any of this.\nCongress has required the district court to set the\namount --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, but\ndistrict courts don't always do what they are supposed\nto. And it seems to me a very strange result that\nyou're --\nMR. HEYTENS: It's true that, regrettably,\ndistrict courts sometimes don't do what they are\nsupposed to. What this Court has said, most notably in\nMontalvo-Murillo, is that we should assume that they\nwill, and that it's inappropriate for courts to craft\nlegal rules that are based on the presumption that they\nare going to violate their legal obligations.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this\nhypothetical? Supposing the defendant fails to appeal\nwhen he's sentenced, and then 90 days later, they impose\na restitution order and he appeals from that. May he\nraise the issues about guilt and innocence and error in\nthe trial in that appeal?\nMR. HEYTENS: Justice Stevens, just to make\nsure I understand -- I want to make sure I understand\nthe hypothetical -- it's that the district court\nsentences him, enters a judgment of conviction, and then\n90 days later imposes an order of restitution?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Correct.\nMR. HEYTENS: Okay. In that situation, no.\nIt is the government's view that he has -- the time for\nappealing the judgment of conviction and the sentence of\nimprisonment has run.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But he -- he can appeal\njust the restitution order.\nMR. HEYTENS: Just the restitution order, in\nthat situation, yes. Now, if he has appealed them both,\nthey can be consolidated, which has been done in several\ncases in the courts --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, I understand that.\nMR. HEYTENS: -- in the circuit court of\nappeals.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You attach no significance\nto the fact that in this case the judge said: I shall\norder restitution? It's the same as if he said nothing\nat all about restitution, so far as you are concerned?\nMR. HEYTENS: We think this makes it an\neasier case, in terms of it establishes that there is no\nconceivable prejudice to Mr. Dolan as a result of the\ndelay in this case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you this\nquestion: If we conclude there's a hole in the statute\nthat Congress has to amend, is it more likely that\nCongress will cure the statute if we rule for you or if\nwe rule against you? It's pretty clear, the answer to\nthat, isn't it?\nMR. HEYTENS: Yes, Justice Stevens. I think\nMontalvo-Murillo supplies the answer to that.\nMontalvo-Murillo says, where Congress does not supply a\nremedy for violation of a statutory time obligation, it\nis inappropriate for courts to invent their own in order\nto coerce district courts into complying --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So this then becomes a\ngoal, not a time line -- a deadline?\nMR. HEYTENS: I think -- at some point, it\nbecomes a debate over precise wording, Justice Ginsburg.\nI think it is a deadline. I think Congress intended for\ndistrict courts to do this. I think district courts who\nhave sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and laws\nof the United States are required to do it.\nThe question is: What is the remedy in the\nrare, regrettable situation where they do not do it? And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So a -- a defendant\nwho is sentenced to a week in prison, and he decides,\nthat's no big deal, I'm not going to appeal, and then\nfinds out, you know, 90 days later he has got to pay a\nmillion dollars in restitution, is just out of luck,\nright?\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, that would be -- yes.\nThat would be our view, Mr. Chief Justice. Now, what I\nwould say is, it is, first of all, our view that the Court\ndoesn't need to resolve any of this. But, second of all,\none of the reasons is there is another way the Court\ncould resolve this, which is to follow the approach the\nCourt took in its decision in Corey v. United States,\nwhich is cited in the blue brief.\nNow, Corey involved a statute. It's\npresentence -- it's pre-Federal sentencing guidelines.\nIt involves a statute that said if, at the time of the\nsentencing, the district court feels like it needs more\ninformation to decide how long to send the defendant to\njail for, it may commit the defendant to the discretion\nof the Attorney General for a period of either 3 to\n6 months; get, essentially, a PSR, before there were\nPSRs; and then make a determination then.\nThe Court in Corey faced the question: When\nthe district court does that -- it says, I'm going to\ngive you to the Attorney General, and we'll come back in\n6 months and decide what your sentence will be -- when\ndoes the defendant have to appeal? That was the\nquestion before the Court in Corey.\nWhat the Court said in Corey is that the\ndefendant may appeal either at the time he is committed\nto the discretion of the Attorney General or at the time\nthe district court imposes the final sentence. The\nreason the Court said that -- this is the language\nthat's cited in the blue brief -- is the Court said it\nwould be extraordinary to tell a Federal criminal\ndefendant that he might have to wait up to 6 months in\norder to take a notice of appeal from his judgment of\nconviction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Look, you straightened me\nout, from your point of view. But now you've mixed me\nup again.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HEYTENS: Sorry. I didn't realize,\nJustice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because I think you said\nthat the defendant is just out of luck. But, previously,\nyou had said that (o) applies, so I thought what you\nwere saying was that the sentence of imprisonment is\nimmediately appealable and must be appealed within\n14 days because of that 3582.\nMR. HEYTENS: That's our --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then you said (o)\napplies, and (o) says that a sentence that imposes an\norder of restitution is a final judgment. So if (o)\napplies, when, 8 months later or 20 months later,\nthat restitution is made final and embodied in another\njudgment, that is a final judgment which can't be\nappealed.\nSo if you're right about (o) applying, then\nthe answer to the question is, no, he is not out of\nluck. Now, don't just agree with me because I seem to\nbe on your side in this question.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HEYTENS: No --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I've got to figure this\nout.\nMR. HEYTENS: I apologize, Justice Breyer.\nThe government's position is that at the time the\njudgment of conviction and the sentence of imprisonment\nare entered, that is the time at which the defendant has\nto appeal and, in our view, he may appeal. Later, when\nthe sentence of restitution is imposed, that is when\nhe appeals that.\nWhat I was suggesting is that, to the extent\nthe Court has any concern about that, the alternative\nway of resolving this issue would be the same way the\nCourt approached the issue in Corey, and you could say\nthat the defendant could appeal at either time.\nNow, we think that would be incorrect, but\nit would be open to the Court to do so to -- or to leave\nthe issue open in order to resolve this case. Because\nas I said before, this defendant never attempted to\nappeal his judgment of conviction or his original term\nof imprisonment. So it's not, in this case, necessary\nto decide what exactly would have happened had he\nattempted to do so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This criminal judgment of\nrestitution -- I assume it's the judge who finds that the\nvictim suffered so much money?\nMR. HEYTENS: That's correct,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does he find that beyond a\nreasonable doubt?\nMR. HEYTENS: No, Justice Scalia. The\nburden --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just more likely than not?\nMR. HEYTENS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it's a criminal --\nit's a criminal judgment?\nMR. HEYTENS: That's what Congress has\nprovided. And in this Court's decision in Oregon v.\nIce, the Court, admittedly in dictum, stated that\nrestitution determinations are a category of\ndeterminations that have been historically made by the\ncourt, not by the jury. And regardless of what anyone\nthinks is the answer to that question, it is certainly\nnot within the question presented. It has not been\nraised at any point by the Petitioner in this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose that an answer to\nthe Chief Justice's concern about the 1-week sentence and\n-- and he's not concerned -- is that all criminal\ndefendants know that an adjudication of guilt is\npreclusive of later issues with -- with respect to civil\n-- civil liability, and they take their chances.\nBut that -- that points up a difference\nbetween this case and Montalvo-Murillo. In this case,\nfinality is central to the system, and that wasn't --\nthat's not really -- wasn't really true in Montalvo.\nMR. HEYTENS: That's certainly correct,\nJustice Kennedy. That was by its terms a bail\ndetermination, which by its nature is not a final\ndetermination in the sense that a criminal statute is,\nthough the Court's language doesn't really suggest that\nthat would make any difference. And I would say that\nsome of the other cases in this same line of cases,\nincluding some of the ones Justice Breyer mentioned, did\nraise finality concerns. There was a very strong\nfinality concern raised in the Peabody Coal case. There\nwere finality concerns raised in Brock, that Congress\nhad said this needs to be done, and once it's done, it\nneeds to be done. And so, there are -- some of the\ncases in this same line have also involved finality,\nadmittedly not in the criminal context.\nBut I think the -- the most important thing\nthat the Court said in -- the two most important things\nthat the Court said in Montalvo-Murillo, as are relevant\nhere, is that, first, when Congress doesn't specify a\nremedy -- and Congress has not specified a remedy in\nthis case -- it's inappropriate for courts to impose\ntheir own.\nThe second thing that the Court said is that\nwe should presume that Federal district courts are going\nto comply with legal obligations, and we shouldn't make\nrules based on the assumption that they won't.\nAnd third is that when courts do impose\nremedies, they shouldn't make -- impose a remedy where\nthere's a profound lack of fit between the violation that\noccurred and the remedy that the defendant is asking\nthem to impose.\nLet me give you an example on that. The\ngeneral rule in Federal criminal litigation is that the\nFederal district court is supposed to impose sentence\nwithout unnecessary delay. Now, say the district court\nviolates that obligation. It takes too long to impose a\nsentence. I think it would be extraordinary to suggest\nthat the remedy of a district court's unnecessary delay\nin sentencing the defendant means the defendant should\nget off scot-free.\nThe remedy is to tell the district court you\nhave taken too long to impose the sentence; impose the\nsentence forthwith.\nThe same thing is true here. Congress has\ntold the district court you need to impose restitution\nin every case where the defendant is convicted of a\ncrime of violence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your argument is\n\"not to exceed 90 days\" means the same thing as \"without\nundue delay\"?\nMR. HEYTENS: We don't think it means the\nsame thing, Mr. Chief Justice. What we think it means\nis the violation should have the same consequences. The\nviolation is to say if you don't do what you are\nsupposed to, the remedy is to do it immediately. The\nremedy isn't to say you don't have to do it anymore.\nIf there are no further questions, the\ngovernment urges that the judgment of the court below be\naffirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Karlan, you have 4 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. KARLAN: I have three points -- excuse\nme -- to make: The first goes to what the remedy is\nhere and what the error is here. The error here\noccurred when the district court did not impose\nrestitution. The government should have filed a timely\nappeal under Rule 4. They had 30 days to do so. The\ngovernment did not appeal the failure to make\nrestitution.\nThat error is not before this Court now.\nWhat's before this Court is a second judgment.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They couldn't do that\nuntil the end of the 90 days. If the judge has 90 days\nto order restitution, that's a vicious cycle argument.\nMS. KARLAN: No, Justice Sotomayor, because\nhad the -- had the government on October 28 looked and\nsaid, there's no restitution order in this case, they\ncould have filed an appeal then under Rule 4, and they\nwould have won. They didn't do so.\nSecond --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's rather\ntheoretical because if that -- I mean, the -- the judge\nsurely would have acted before he could process an\nappeal.\nMS. KARLAN: Well, he lacks actually the --\nthe power to do that. Once the appeal is taken, he\ncan't do that. And may I just say that here I think the\ncritical rule to understand is one sentence, one appeal.\nSo turning first --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's not true. I\ndon't know if you've had time to look at 3582 or 35 --\nMS. KARLAN: Yes, I have.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Those do appear to say\nthat once there's a term of imprisonment, that that\nconstitutes a final judgment.\nMS. KARLAN: But they do so in the context\nof Section 3553(a), which is cited on page 6 of the\nyellow brief, which says \"the court shall impose a\nsentence.\"\nNow, the different components can each be\nadded together. But there is one sentence in a criminal\ncase on a particular charge, and that sentence can\ninclude restitution, it can include a fine, it can\ninclude imprisonment. That doesn't make it three\nsentences. And only when all of those have been imposed\nis there a final judgment. Until then, the judgment --\nJUSTICE ALITO: It can also include\nforfeiture. What's -- what is the rule for forfeiture?\nMS. KARLAN: I don't know the rule for\nforfeiture. I do know the rule for all of the other criminal\nproceedings, which is 3582(b), to which the government\nrefers; 3572(c) for fines; 3562(b) for community\nrelease; and 3664(o) for restitution. All of those have\nto make one sentence, and then there is one appeal.\nUnder our rule, which I think comports with\nthe plain language of the statute, we know when an\nappeal takes place, and there will be one appeal. Under\nthe government's rule --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference -- in\nresponse to the last argument that your opponent made,\nwhat is the difference between the provision here and\nRule 32(b)(1) of the criminal rules, the court must\nimpose sentence without unnecessary delay?\nMS. KARLAN: There, the question is, did it\ndo it without unnecessary delay? Here the question is,\ndid it do it within 90 days? When it didn't, the\ngovernment had to appeal. The government did not do\nthat.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So if the -- I didn't\nunderstand the answer. If the sentence is not imposed\nwithout unnecessary delay, the consequence is that there\ncan be no sentence?\nMS. KARLAN: No. This Court has never\ndecided what the rule means there. But this is a\nstatute. And if I could turn to the question of what\nthe statute --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Before you do that, tell me\nwhat the government appeal would consist of. The 90 days\nhas expired --\nMS. KARLAN: And the judgment of August 8th\nbecame final.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you -- you tell\nme the court -- the court has no ability to impose\nrestitution after 90 days.\nMS. KARLAN: That's right. The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's the use of appealing?\nMS. KARLAN: Because on appeal you say the\ncourt erred, and it imposed an illegal sentence --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the appellate court says\ntoo bad --\nMS. KARLAN: No --\nJUSTICE SCALIA -- 90 days are up.\nMS. KARLAN: No, Justice Scalia. In the\nsame way that if a court failed to impose a mandatory minimum\nsentence and there was a final judgment, the government\ncould appeal. And the fact that the initial sentence\ndidn't do that doesn't mean anything at that point.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is no time limit on\nthe mandatory minimum.\nMS. KARLAN: But the -- but -- but, Your\nHonor, if the government appeals an illegal sentence,\nthat sentence can be corrected and the new mandate from\nthe court of appeals saying you erred in not imposing\nmandatory restitution starts the 90-day clock again.\nNow, this is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Could you go back to --\ncould you go back to Justice Alito's question,\nbecause --\nMS. KARLAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that was exactly the\nsame thing. I think what he may be saying, though, is\nit makes more sense to read these statutes as saying\nimprisonment or community -- or community service, a\nform of supervised release, or fines -- I don't know\nabout forfeiture -- can be appealed as separate final\njudgments, because then you don't have to wait for\n90 days.\nMS. KARLAN: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if you read it that\nway, it's fairer to the defendant, and you don't have to\nworry about the restitution appeal because of (o).\nNow, what blocks the reading -- what blocks\nthe reading I just gave?\nMS. KARLAN: The principle that there must\nbe one sentence that determines each of the punishments\nfor a particular crime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
