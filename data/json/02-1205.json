        "content": "(10:24 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 02-1205, Edith Jones v. R.R. Donnelley & Sons.\nMs. Gorman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF H. CANDACE GORMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. GORMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress answered the call of the judiciary by\nenacting section 1658, a bright line rule that provides a\ndefault statute of limitations of 4 years for any civil\naction arising under an act of Congress after December\n1st, 1990.\nSection 1658 applies to plaintiff's claims\nbecause this Court said in Patterson that plaintiff did\nnot have claims of racial harassment and -- and\ntermination and discharge claims.\nPlaintiff's claims arise under the 1991 Civil\nRights Act because that is the act that created the cause\nof action that plaintiff has filed under.\nIn Rivers, this Court held that the 1991 act, as\namended by the 1991 Civil Rights Act, was a new cause of\naction that created new liabilities and a new standard of\nconduct. Therefore, under section 1658, under the plain\nmeaning of that statute, the 1991 Civil Rights Act\napplies.\nThe simple one-sentence statute has been\ninterpreted in such a way as to give it no meaning. The\nterms, arising under, and the term, civil action, are\nsimple terms used by this Court repeatedly to describe the\nstatute's reach and that reach includes all civil actions\narising under an act of Congress after December 1st, 1990,\nwhether it has roots in or references preexisting law.\nQUESTION: Ms. Gorman, one of the anomalies that\nif -- if you are complaining about a refusal to hire, a\ndiscriminatory refusal to hire, the limitation would be 2\nyears, but if you're complaining about a discriminatory\nfiring, it would be 4 years.\nto have those two claims both stemming from the original\n1981, but one having extended it?\nMS. GORMAN: Yes. I -- I believe it does, Your\nHonor, and the reason is that the purpose of section 1658\nis to cut down on borrowing and State limitations periods\nthat have been used for the borrowing purposes, and\nanything that cuts down on those purposes of borrowing is\ngoing to be going to the effect of that statute.\nNow, the fact that there are two statutes of\nlimitations is not unusual in -- in the discrimination\ncases that I file. There are often many statutes of\nlimitations that someone has to look at. For example, in\nthe Age Discrimination Act, there are two statutes of\nlimitations for willful and not willful. Often claims are\nfiled under section -- under title VII, as well as under\nsection 1981, and we have various statutes of limitations\nthat we deal with in those claims as well.\nQUESTION: But one can see some rhyme or reason\nto those differences. Here it seems that -- that one\nclaim is -- is no more deserving of a longer time than the\nother.\nMS. GORMAN: Well, we have to look at the plain\nmeaning of the statute, Your Honor. And it is a default\nstatute of limitations, so Congress has the option at any\ntime of creating a -- a statute of limitations going back\nto 1981 if it thinks that this is not the way it wanted it\nto work out. But it -- the statute is clear that it's for\nall new causes of action or for all causes of action that\narise under acts of Congress after December 1st, 1990, and\nI think it's very clear that plaintiffs' claims did not\narise until the 1991 Civil Rights Act. Plaintiffs could\nnot file a cause of action until that 1991 Civil Rights\nAct.\nQUESTION: Do you want us to interpret this\nsection (b) as a new cause of action, in other words?\nMS. GORMAN: The 1991 act. The claims -- I'm\nonly addressing the narrow issue -\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. GORMAN: -- of the claims that plaintiff\ncould not file prior to -\nQUESTION: Section (b). You -- you want us to\ninterpret section (b) as a new cause of action?\nMS. GORMAN: Correct. And I believe that\nfollows from the Court's decisions both in Patterson and\nin Rivers.\nQUESTION: If -- if you completely untie section\n(b) from section (a), number one, it doesn't make any\nsense, and number two, the -- the implied cause of action\nthat we have found might disappear because we have told\nCongress, when you enact a new cause of action -- or a new\nstatute, you have to say explicitly if it creates a\nprivate cause of action.\nMS. GORMAN: I believe Congress addressed that\nin the 1991 Civil Rights Act, codifying that this was a -\nthat there was a private right of action involved. But\nthis Court had already -\nQUESTION: Where -- does it say that in 1981?\nMS. GORMAN: In 1981(c).\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I'm not sure I read it\nthat way.\nMS. GORMAN: The rights protected by this\nsection are protected against impairment by nongovernment\ndiscrimination and impairment under color of law.\nQUESTION: That doesn't sound like an explicit\ncreation of a cause of action to me.\nMS. GORMAN: Well, Your Honor, this Court had\nalso said in Patterson that 1981 did create a private\nright of action.\nQUESTION: Well, that's what -- but that was\nunder 1981. You're saying it's a new cause of action, and\nI'm saying that if it's a new cause of action, then\nCongress has to be explicit that there's a private cause\nof action.\nMS. GORMAN: I believe the language in section\n(c) was put in there just to\nsaid in Patterson, that this was a private right of\naction, was going forward with the new statute.\nAnd to the point that this is definitional,\nwhich I think was what you were also raising, Justice\nKennedy, the fact that Congress adds definitions to create\ncauses of action was recognized by this Court in Rivers as\na way that Congress often creates causes of action. So I\nbelieve that that's very consistent with how this -- how\nCongress enacts causes of action.\nQUESTION: Your -- your argument really rests on\nthe proposition that arising under has a -- a uniform\nmeaning, that it doesn't acquire different meanings in\ndifferent contexts, doesn't it?\nMS. GORMAN: I believe it rests on the\nproposition that the most common way of meaning -- using\narising under is the way Justice Holmes described it and\nthat's that a suit arises under the law that creates the\ncause of action. And that's what we're saying here, that\nthis suit relies on the 1991 law. That's what created\nplaintiff's cause of action.\nQUESTION: Well, we've -- we've also held that\n-- that arising under embraces not just a -- a Federal\ncause of action but even State causes of action that\nrequire determination of a Federal question for which the\nFederal question is -- is sort\ncould you possibly apply that meaning to this statute? It\nwould mean that the Federal Government would be\nestablishing statutes of limitation for State causes of\naction.\nMS. GORMAN: I don't believe that's how the\nstatute was -- was drafted, Your Honor. The Eleventh\nAmendment does not place any limitation on Congress'\nability to establish a Federal statute of limitations for\na Federal claim, and I believe section 1658 is clearly\ndirected to Federal causes of action, Federal civil\nactions, not to State civil actions.\nQUESTION: Not if you use arising under the way\nwe use it in other contexts where -- where it -- a claim\ncan -- can be thought to arise under, for purposes of -\nof Federal court jurisdiction, even though the cause of\naction is -- is a State cause of action.\nMS. GORMAN: Your Honor, I believe arising under\nin this sense should be used in the way that it's most\nused by this Court and in the way that it's used in title\n28, which is where this statute was -- is codified. As\nJustice Frankfurter said, you -- you take the soil along\nwith it, that goes along with the other statutes. So the\nfact that this Court has repeatedly and consistently said\nin title 28 that a cause of action arises under the law\nthat creates the cause of action or if it depends -\ndepends on that cause of action. I believe that's the -\nthe way arising under should be used in this case as well.\nQUESTION: All right. So you're picking one of\nvarious -- various meanings, but that's all that the other\nside is doing too.\nMS. GORMAN: But I believe this is the more\nconsistent approach with how this Court has looked at\narising under in the -- in the jurisdictional context\nbecause that is where this Court -- that is where Congress\nhas placed this definition in the statute.\nQUESTION: I don't think so. I think in cases\nsuch as Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Company, we've\n-- we've said that arising under jurisdiction includes\nwhere the cause of action is based on State law, but\nrelief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial\nquestion of Federal law. We say that Federal courts can\ntake jurisdiction in that situation.\nAnd as I say, if you apply that meaning here, it\n-- it means that you're -- you're setting a Federal\nstatute of limitations for State causes of action unless\nyou want to disown Smith v. Kansas City and that line of\ncases.\nMS. GORMAN: Your Honor, what I'm suggesting is\nthat the -- the reasoning of this Court has been\nconsistently that under title 28, arising under has been\nused as Justice Holmes has suggested it, and that's what\nI'm suggesting is the -- is the bright line rule that this\nCourt should follow in this case.\nQUESTION: I'm suggesting that's wrong.\nMS. GORMAN: I understand, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: What do you do with the hypothetical\nthat was raised in -- in the briefs on the other side that\nsuppose Congress shrinks the people who are exempt from\ntitle VII, say, and makes it 15 or more employees instead\nof 25 or more employees? Then what do you do with the\npeople who are newly included? Do they get a longer\nstatute than the ones who were there before?\nMS. GORMAN: Yes, Your Honor, I believe they do.\nAnd again, I want to point out that this is a default\nstatute of limitations, so Congress would always have the\nability to affix a statute of limitations.\nQUESTION: But -- but in -- in determining what\nCongress meant, is it -- wouldn't it be relevant that that\nseems something no legislature would want to have happen,\nthat people who are newly covered by the same prescription\nget more time to sue than people who have always been\ncovered?\nMS. GORMAN: Your Honor, first that example\ncomes from title VII which does have its own -\nQUESTION: I know. I know.\none that comes under 1981 or 1982.\nMS. GORMAN: I still think we have to give the\nplain meaning of the -- of the statute its effect, and\nCongress -- we have to understand that Congress set this\nas a default and if Congress does not want to have this\nanomaly where people who are between 15 and 25 employees\nin a -- in an employment relationship where it's under 25\nemployees and now a cause of action has been created for\nthem -- if Congress does not want to have that situation,\nthen Congress is going to have to draft a statute of\nlimitations which that -- with that law, which Congress\nhas shown under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that it is more\nthan willing and able to do.\nWhen Congress adopted -- when Congress amended\nthe Telecommunications Act of 1936 to add the Sarbanes-\nOxley amendment, it put in the statute of limitations that\nit knew it wanted to have so it would be consistent with\nother statute of limitations within that statute. And it\nis clear from the reading of that statute, that if\nCongress -- that Congress thought if they had not put in\nthat amendment, that the 4-year statute of -- of\nlimitations would apply even though that was an amendment\nto a preexisting statute.\nQUESTION: Another problem that was raised in\nthe brief on the other side was what would you do with a\ncircuit that had a law -- that it had interpreted the law\nas allowing no claim and there's a circuit where other\ncircuits have -- have allowed a claim in the -- and we\nhaven't spoken. In the circuit that said there was no\nclaim and then -- so that people are newly covered -\nsuppose Congress eliminates that circuit split and it\nmakes it clear that everybody is covered. Then what\nhappens in the circuit where people were not covered until\nCongress clarified the law? Do they get the 4 years?\nMS. GORMAN: I believe in most cases I think\neveryone will get 4 years, and the reason I say that is\nbecause section 1658 does not address the circuit -\ncircuit split. It addresses the statute that's enacted by\nCongress. So if Congress enacts the statute setting forth\na cause of action that was not codified before, then I\nbelieve that that 4-year statute of limitations would\napply.\nQUESTION: Well, but that -- that's the issue,\nwhether it was codified before. Some circuits say it was\nalready there. Other circuits say it wasn't there. For\nthe latter circuits, this would be a new creation of a\ncause of action. For the former, it would not. Now, I\nagree there's only one right answer; either -- either it\nexisted under the old law or it didn't exist under the old\nlaw.\nBut frankly, I don't want to have to sit here\nand resolve -- resolve questions of whether something\nexisted under an old law for no purpose except to decide\nwhether -- whether this statute of limitations provision\ncuts in or not. I mean, it's a weird thing to have us\ndoing, deciding whether a statute was really merely\nreaffirming an old law or whether it was enacting a new\ncause of action. I -\nMS. GORMAN: I -- I think one thing that we\nwould always be able to do is to look at these statutes.\nSince we're looking at this in the abstract, it's hard to\nsay. But -- but taking the -- the 1991 statute, for\nexample, where Congress defines it in the purpose as\nexpanding the rights, then I think it's clear that this is\nsomething new that did not exist before. So I think -\nQUESTION: But in -- in -\nMS. GORMAN: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cut you\noff.\nI was -- in the case of the circuit split, I\nthought the statute that broke -- that -- that resolved\nthe circuit split and confirmed that there was a cause of\naction would -- would qualify on your theory of arising\nunder because your -- your cause of action would, in part,\nbe based upon the amending statute. Am I wrong?\nMS. GORMAN: No. That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMS. GORMAN: That is what I'm suggesting.\nQUESTION: Well -- well, it has to -\nQUESTION: But what about the circuit that\nalready recognized the cause of action? May I repeat my\nquestion?\nSay that -- prior to the statutory amendment,\nthe Seventh Circuit had already recognized the cause of\naction that the amendment confirmed. Now, would it be a\nnew cause of action in the Seventh Circuit?\nMS. GORMAN: I don't think it would be a new\ncause of action but it would now be arising under an act\nof Congress that was enacted after 1990, and I think -\nQUESTION: But the Seventh Circuit thought it\narose under an act of Congress even before the amendment.\nMS. GORMAN: I understand, Your Honor, but I\nthink if you look at the purpose of the statute and if we\nuse Patterson as an example, in Patterson the Court said\nthere was no claim under 1981 for post-contract claims.\nAnd then when Congress enacted the 1991 act, if -- if --\nI'm sorry. Patterson had not been decided by this Court,\nbut we had circuits in a disarray on this issue and then\nCongress enacted the 1991 act and said in there we are\nexpanding -\nQUESTION: Oh, I see.\nMS. GORMAN: -- and defining. Then I believe\nthat the 4-year statute would apply.\nAnd if I may, Your Honor, I'd like to reserve\nthe remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Ms. Gorman.\nMS. GORMAN: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Garre, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nPetitioners' claims for racial discrimination in\nthe terms and condition of employment are subject to the\nuniform statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1658\nbecause those claims were created by and therefore arise\nunder the Civil Rights Act of 1991, an act of Congress\nenacted after December 1 -\nQUESTION: Mr. Garre, as has already been\npointed out, the interpretation does give rise to some\nanomalies and interpreting it the other way might as well.\nWhat could Congress have provided in section 1658(a) to\navoid some of these questions?\nMR. GARRE: Well -\nQUESTION: How could it have been written -\nMR. GARRE: Justice --\nQUESTION: -- so we wouldn't be in this mess?\nMR. GARRE: Justice O'Connor, I think some of\nthe -- the issues that have been identified to the Court\nare a direct product of the compromise that Congress\nstruck in 1990. Originally the act, as proposed by the\nFederal Courts Study Committee, would have applied a\nuniform statute of limitations to all existing causes of\naction. And some Members of Congress and groups believed\nthat that would create retroactivity concerns. So the --\nthe compromise that was adopted was that the uniform\nstatute of limitations would apply on a going-forward\nbasis with respect to causes of actions that were created\nby acts of Congress enacted after December 1990.\nThis case involves precisely such a cause of\naction. Petitioners' claims we know from the Patterson\ncase were not actionable under statute 1981 prior to the\n1991 Civil Rights Act. The only reason petitioners are in\nCourt today and have viable claims is because of the 1991\nCivil Rights Act. Therefore, we think that respondent's\nposition which results in the conclusion that petitioners'\nclaims arise under the -- the same statute at issue in\nPatterson, the statute that we know does not create those\nclaims, is an absurd conclusion that\nagainst their position.\nQUESTION: What if the statute did create those\nclaims? I mean, I'm getting back to the circuit split\nquestion.\nMR. GARRE: We --\nQUESTION: It seems to me you don't give the\nsame answer that -- that the petitioner does.\nMR. GARRE: Justice Scalia, we think that the\ncircuit split problem would be resolved for purposes of\nsection 1658 the same way it would be resolved for\nretroactivity purposes. Anytime Congress creates a new\ncause of actions, there -- there are going to be questions\nthat arise from the creation of that cause of action.\nThe Court considered the same question in Hughes\nAircraft v. United States ex rel. Schumer where Congress\namended the False Claims Act to eliminate a jurisdictional\ndefense, and this Court said, on pages 949 and 950 of its\nopinion, created a new cause of action. And therefore,\nthe Court held that cause of action cannot be\nretroactively applied.\nQUESTION: So you're saying we -- we will have\nto resolve these -- these circuit splits for no purpose\nwhatever except to decide whether the statute of\nlimitations applies. Right? We'll have to -\nMR. GARRE: No, Justice Scalia.\nthat the same issue would -- would arise for retroactivity\npurpose, whether or not Congress has created a new cause\nof action which would apply retroactivity -- retroactively\nor not. And even if the retroactivity question didn't\narise, that's a product of the statute that Congress has\ndrawn.\nAnother -- another problem with respondent's\nconstruction -\nQUESTION: As you interpret it.\nMR. GARRE: As we interpret it, and we think\nthat that is the plain meaning of Congress' use of both\nthe -- the all-inclusive term, the traditionally inclusive\nterm, arising under, as well as Congress' reference to an\nact of Congress.\nQUESTION: What -- what is your position as to\nwhether the statute of limitations applies to State causes\nof action?\nMR. GARRE: We don't think it applies to State\ncauses of action at all.\nQUESTION: Then you're not using the all-\ninclusive term, arising under.\nMR. GARRE: Well, that's not a product that\nCongress has used of arising under. It's a question of\nwhether Congress intended to supply a Federal statute of\nlimitations for State claims.\nQUESTION: Well, and -- and you say they didn't\nbecause -- so your -- since it's absurd to think they did\nthat, you're -- you're giving arising under a narrower\ninterpretation than -- than we give it for -\nMR. GARRE: Well -\nQUESTION: -- for purposes of -- of Federal\njurisdiction.\nMR. GARRE: In the first place, we think that\nplaintiffs' claims arise under the 1991 Civil Rights Act\nunder any definition of arising under, dictionary\ndefinition, the statutory definition, and 28 U.S.C.\n1331 -\nQUESTION: But -- but that contradicts your\nother position that -- that we're going to have to resolve\nthis question in order to determine the circuit splits\nbecause if you believe that, your -- your answer would be\nthe same as -- as the petitioners. You don't have to\nresolve those circuit splits so long as there's a later\nstatute. It arises under the State -- under the later\nstatute. Whether it arises under both, who cares?\nMR. GARRE: No.\nQUESTION: That's not your position.\nMR. GARRE: The question would be the same\nquestion that this Court considered in the Rivers case\nwhich was whether or not Congress created new causes of\naction in the 1991 Civil Rights Act, and the Court\nanalyzed that question by looking to Congress' intent\nenacting that act. Some parties argued that Congress had\nsimply clarified and continued into effect old rights.\nOther parties argued that Congress had created new rights,\nand this Court agreed with that interpretation. And we\nthink that that interpretation requires the conclusion in\nthis case that petitioners' claims are governed by the\nstatute of limitations in section 1658.\nIf I could refer to another problem with\nrespondent's construction and that is it -- it essentially\nrenders inoperative the default rule established by\nCongress in section 1658 in the vast majority of cases,\nand that's because Congress rarely creates the kind of\nwholly new and self-contained cause of action that has no\nreference to or roots in Federal law. And that's the only\ntime that the default rule, which Congress thought was a\nsignificant improvement to the prior practice of State -\nborrowing State statute of limitations would apply under\n-- under respondent's -- under respondent's\ninterpretation.\nQUESTION: Well, it did so in the Truth in\nLending Act and -- and the Clean Air Act and the Clean\nWater Act. Those are all new enactments.\nMR. GARRE: But -- but, Justice Kennedy,\nCongress often chooses to -- to build upon existing\nFederal law in creating causes of action.\nQUESTION: Well, in this case, what about the\nproblem with the implied cause of action? I don't read\nsection (c) as explicitly granting a -- a private cause of\naction.\nMR. GARRE: We think -- from our understanding\nof section (c), it was intended to clarify that section\n1981 does create a private right of action, which -- which\nthis Court had held in Runyan and reaffirmed in Patterson.\nBut we don't think it's a problem if the Court\nconcludes that petitioners' claims depend on both\nsubsection (a) of 1981 and subsection (b) of 1981 because\npetitioners' claims only exist today because of the 1991\nact, in that respect, arise under that act, under the\ndictionary definition of arising under and under the\nsettled definition of arising under that Congress uses in\ntitle 28 of the United States Code.\nPetitioner seems to read the statute's reference\nto an act of Congress to refer only to an act of Congress\nthat creates the kind of wholly new self-contained cause\nof action I mentioned.\nQUESTION: You mean respondent, yes.\nMR. GARRE: Respondent. You're right, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nBut we think, as -- as Judge Alito concluded in\nhis dissenting opinion in the Zubi case, that an act of\nCongress is just as naturally read and has to be read to\ninclude an act of Congress that creates a cause of action\nby amending an existing cause of action.\nAnd all of respondent's objections about the\npracticality of our position, which we think is -- is the\nplain-meaning position of what Congress -- the statute\nthat Congress wrote, have to be weighed against the\nintractable problems that this Court and the Federal\nCourts Study Committee identified with respect to the past\npractice of borrowing State statutes of limitations.\nOur inquiry focuses the analysis exclusively on\nCongress' actions and Federal law, and we think that\nthat's where Congress wanted the courts to focus. The\nprior practice focused the inquiry on State law. It\nrequired Federal courts to canvas State law, to identify\nan analogous State cause of action, and then to try to\nidentify the statute of limitations that would apply in\nthe State to that cause of action, and then to make a\nseparate determination whether that State statute of\nlimitations could appropriately be applied to Federal law.\nAnd that had created great uncertainty and great disparity\nin the application of Federal law. Indeed, under the old\npractice, a single Federal claim could be subjected to 50\ndifferent State statutes of limitations.\nAnd that was the problem that Congress was\naddressing at the -- the recommendation of the Federal\nCourts Study Committee in enacting section 1658. And it\ndecided, as a result of the compromise, to apply it only\non a going-forward basis with respect to new claims that\nwere created by Congress after 1990.\nPetitioners' claims only exist today as a result\nof Congress' action in the 1991 act, and we think they're\nclearly governed by the default statute of limitations\nestablished by section 1658.\nAs petitioners' counsel made clear, section 1658\nis only a default rule. Congress can always specify a\ndifferent rule and it has done so several times since\n1990. It did so in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of -- of 2002,\nand that's significant because that act, Sarbanes-Oxley,\namending an existing cause of action under the Securities\nand Exchange Act -- so if -- if Congress had in mind the\ninterpretation of section 1658 that respondent proposes,\nit's certainly odd that Congress felt obliged to amend\n1658 to put in the special statute of limitations for\nsecurities laws claims.\nQUESTION: What was the period prescribed in the\nSarbanes-Oxley statute?\nMR. GARRE: It's 2 years after the discovery of\nfacts and 5 years after the violation, which is different\nthan the 4-year rule established by Congress in section\n1658(a).\nWe think the court of appeals in this case erred\nin subjecting petitioners' section 1981 claims, which only\nexist because of the 1991 Civil Rights Act, to the old\nborrowing practice that Congress sought to put an end to\nin 1990, and we think that this Court should hold that\nthose claims are governed by the uniform statute of\nlimitations established by section 1658.\nQUESTION: Will there be some retroactivity\nproblems if some States have 6-year statute of limitations\nand this reduces that period?\nMR. GARRE: No. As -- as Judge Alito explained\nin his -- may I answer that question?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. GARRE: As Judge Alito explained in the Zubi\ndissent, there's no retroactivity problems because the\nonly expectation that a plaintiff could have after\nCongress created the new causes of action in 1991 is if\nthose causes of actions would be subject to the default\nstatute of limitations specified.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Garre.\nMR. GARRE: Thank you.\nQUESTION: We'll hear now from Mr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIt seems to me that there are two propositions\nthat arise out of the conversation of the past 25 minutes.\nFirst of all, there is no single uniform meaning\nof the -- of the expression, arising under. It is not a\nterm of art. It is a term of chaos. It is a -- it is a\nphrase that is used repeatedly in different contexts,\nroutinely used with a very pragmatic -- in a very\npragmatic fashion and does not answer the question whether\nor not Congress, when it adopted 1658, or Congress, when\nit amended section 1981, really envisioned this kind of\nexpansive interpretation that would allow an argument to\nbe made that State laws are suddenly subject to statutes\nof limitations. As Justice Scalia asked, when you make\nother kinds of adjustments in these schemes, are you going\nto have to resolve every -- every one of these issues?\nI mean, the question with respect to the split\nin the circuits. There is currently pending a proposed\nchange to the Air Carriers Access Act that specifically\nresolves the conflict in the circuits between the Eleventh\nCircuit which says there is no cause of action and other\ncircuits that says there is a cause of action.\nThese aren't hypotheticals. These are real\nissues and if this Court is not careful in how it tries to\nconfine the interpretation of section 1658, it's going to\nbe interpreting the statute for the better part of the\nnext 10 years, which may be good news for me as a\npractitioner before the Court. But I'm quite certain that\nit's not good news either for my clients, for the lower\ncourts that are going to have to adjudicate these problems\nor for -\nQUESTION: The solution to the last problem you\nraised offered by the petitioner is simply you use the\nnewer statute, and you don't have to look into the\nquestion of -- of which side of the circuit conflict was\ncorrect. If the right is created by the new statute, it\ndidn't matter whether it -- if it's affirmed by the new\nstatute, you're suing under the new statute, it doesn't\nmatter whether it existed before or not. Why isn't that\nan adequate solution?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it might be an adequate\nsolution, Justice Scalia, except that it's not self-\nevident from the language, arising under. The question is\nwhat -- what is the use of arising under that you're going\nto try to apply in a more or less uniform fashion.\nQUESTION: But I think isn't her answer to the\n-- to the fact that it isn't self-evident from the\nlanguage alone an answer she gave to a separate question,\nand that is that it's the policy of Congress to apply the\n-- the 4-year rule when it can so that if in doubt -- if\nthe language allows but doesn't compel, then the answer\nwould be apply the new statute because that is going to\nget to the congressional objective of getting the 4-year\nstatute as broad -\nMR. PHILLIPS: And there -- and I don't think\nthere's support for that objective in -- in this\nparticular statute because if Congress really meant -\nQUESTION: Well, isn't the -- isn't the support\nthat they started out by intending to -- to apply the 4\nyear period, I mean, across the board and they -- they\nonly fell back out of fear of -- of violating reliance\ninterests which would say the -- the objective is still to\nget the broadest possible application?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, no. It's a question of -\nI mean, they -- they obviously made a -- a compromise, but\nthe question is why isn't it as reasonable a compromise to\nsay, look, we're going to deal with this in the truly\nclassic sense of the word prospective. Every new self-\ncontained statute that goes into effect is now subject to\nthis rule. And -- and literally, as Justice Kennedy\nsaid -\nQUESTION: They could -\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- they do that every day.\nQUESTION: -- they could have said that, but the\n-- the counter-argument to -- to what you've just said is\n-- and -- and maybe this is -- I hope you'll comment on\nthis, that on your reading, the 4-year statute is -- is\nrarely going to be applied simply because there -- there\naren't very many sort of absolutely brand-new,\nfreestanding, self-contained causes of action. Most of\nthem are -- are subjects of tinkering from time to time.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, Justice Souter, the -- the\nreality is that this is far more common than you think.\nThe anti-terrorism statute has specific standalone causes\nof action. The Muhammad Ali Reform -- Boxing Reform Act\nhas a standalone cause of action. I mean, there are, in\nfact a host of statutes in which Congress does precisely\nwhat the other side claims it rarely does. I mean, this\n-- if -- if the Court would like us to provide a list,\nwe'd be happy to do it.\nQUESTION: Yes, but the argument is the other\nway. I mean, it's that very often major pieces of\nlegislation are enacted in the form of what looks like an\namendment of a current statute. I think of the Celler-\nKefauver Act. I mean, on your theory, all of merger law\nwould really be viewed as not a new statute when it was\ntotally new. There were no merger cases to speak of prior\nto Celler-Kefauver. And then they come in and section 7\napplies to assets and all of a sudden you have merger law.\nWell, on your view that would be just viewed as -- as if\nit were some kind of trivial amendment when it created\nhalf of anti-trust law. I mean, you see, that's the kind\nof problem I think -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, no, I understand that, but\nthe problem you still have, Justice Breyer, is that you've\ngot to figure out how do you try to reconcile -\nQUESTION: Well, we reconcile it by saying if\nit's a new -- you look at the act of Congress. An act of\nCongress is called Public Law 3278 or whatever it is, and\nif prior to that act of Congress, you didn't have the\ncause of action, and if after you did, well, that's what\nthey mean. It arises under a new act of Congress. That\nseems pretty simple.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's -- that's pretty simple,\nJustice Breyer, but it doesn't answer Justice Kennedy's\nquestion which is if you look at this particular act of\nCongress, which is codified in subsection (b), it doesn't\ngive you any basis for a right of action. The\ninfrastructure -\nQUESTION: It doesn't give you any -- oh, now,\nnow, all right -\nMR. PHILLIPS: That definitional provision\ndoesn't remotely -\nQUESTION: -- that -- that -- if you're asking\nme the question, I'd answer that question by saying, of\ncourse, they intended a private right of action to apply.\nI mean, now let's go into the history of it and see\nwhether they did or not.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But, Justice Breyer, that's -\nQUESTION: And I think -- I think that by the -\nbut that's a different issue.\nBut in my way of thinking, that doesn't raise a\nserious question because I don't believe that they didn't\nintend to raise -- to have this as a private right of\naction.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But I still -- but that still\ndoesn't answer what -- what strikes me as the fundamental\nquestion which is when Congress approached section 1981,\ndid it think that it was, in fact, creating a whole new\ninfrastructure cause of action or was it basically simply\nengrafting it back onto what section 1981 has been since\n1866.\nQUESTION: It was engrafting it on and before\nthey passed the act of Congress, you did not have this\nkind of cause of action, and after they wrote the new act,\nyou did have it. Therefore -\nMR. PHILLIPS: But -- but you -- but, Justice\nBreyer, you only have this cause of action because four -\nthree of the four elements arise and existed long before\n1991, and those -- and that -- and it clearly has to arise\nunder that portion of it as well. So the question is, if\nit arises under both, what's the right resolution of the\nquestion?\nAnd the point that, it seems to me, that the\npetitioner and the United States have never responded to\nis why is it you would adopt a rule that carries with it\nas much complication and complexity as the rule that they\npropose when you don't have to come out that --\nQUESTION: I think their answer is, as I\nunderstand it, that is the approach that gives maximum\neffect to the new statutes of limitation that -- that\nCongress has enacted. Now, what -- what evidence is there\nthat Congress wanted it to have maximum effect?\nMR. PHILLIPS: There is no evidence that\nCongress wanted it to have maximum effect.\nQUESTION: Well, except the fact they enacted\nthe statute.\nMR. PHILLIPS: The statute applies on a regular\nbasis to almost everyday acts that Congress adopts in\nwhich they provide a cause of action and do not provide a\nstatute of limitations. And that spares this Court and\nevery other court the burden of having to borrow from\nState law, trying to figure out what analogous State law\nclaims would be used as the basis for a statute of\nlimitations.\nQUESTION: One of the problems that troubles me\nabout borrowing State law -- I've had a lot of experience\nin these cases -- that if you look at this statute under\nState law, I think the old cause of action that Patterson\nrecognized would be a contract cause of action. And\narguably, the one before us today is a tort action. So\nyou'd probably have to follow the State tort law statute\nof limitations for half the case and the contract statute\nof limitations for the other half of the case, after you\nfigure out which State law applies. So you have this\nproblem, even if you're referring back to State law, of\nmaybe coming out with two different results.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Except that I think, for the most\npart, the courts have pretty well resolved what they were\ngoing to do with respect to section 1981. I would have\nthought the problem -\nQUESTION: Well, the section 1981 as construed\nin Patterson is clearly a contract claim.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nQUESTION: But as -- but this cause of action I\ndon't think is clearly a contract claim.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it's difficult to know\nwhether Congress meant to change that. I -- I don't\ndisagree with that.\nBut I -- but it still seems to me the more\nfundamental problem in trying to sort out what Congress\ndid with respect to section 1981 is that it never intended\nto make this into a brand new infrastructure. It took the\nexisting four elements. It didn't change a single word in\nsection 1981 when it implemented this cause of action. So\nthe notion that this is a cause of action that arises only\nunder the 1990 act is clearly -- under the 1991 act is\nclearly --\nQUESTION: How much -- how much trouble are we\ngoing to have in the future if -- if we adopted your -\nyour theory? How -- you know, how am I to decide in the\nfuture whether a new cause of action arises all by itself\nor whether it -- it attaches to a greater or lesser degree\nto a preexisting statute? What's -- is it an easy test?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- I think every court that has\nadopted that test -- certainly the Seventh Circuit in this\ncase and other courts of appeals have recognized that it\nis an infinitely simpler test than trying to figure out\nwhat arising under will mean in all of its various\npermutations and new statutes. All you have to look at is\nto see whether or not the cause -- the elements -- all the\nelements of the cause of action are newly created. That\nmay be embodied in a -- in an amendment to an existing\nstatute. It may be on a stand alone basis. But I -- I\nsubmit to you that is a significantly simpler course to\nfollow.\nAnd, indeed, I don't -\nQUESTION: But one thing that isn't simpler\nabout it, Mr. Phillips, is the problem that Congress\nsought to cure with 1658, that is, you can have amazing\ndiversity across the country if you're borrowing States'\nlimits. For the same claim, it could be 2 years in one\nState, 3 years in another, 6 in another. Congress surely\nwanted to cut out that disparity so that similarly\nsituated people would have the same right to sue.\nMR. PHILLIPS: On a prospective basis, there's\nno question about that, that the Congress had passed the\nAnti-terrorism Act that created a new cause of action, did\nnot want the kind of inherent inequalities that arise\nunder borrowing to go forward.\nQUESTION: And that's suggesting that -\nMR. PHILLIPS: It says nothing about what the\nCongress did retroactively.\nQUESTION: -- that the old way is inherently\ncomplex because you have to figure out which would be the\nclosest State limitation. And Congress just wanted to get\naway from that complexity. I\nthat that what was introduced is -- is more complex. It\nseems to me less so.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- Justice Ginsburg, your\nown hypotheticals suppose exactly how many complexities\nare going to arise, and I -- I can assure you that as -\nas much imagination as we've put into this, plaintiffs'\ncounsels and defense counsel going forward will try even\nharder to end up fighting these issues in terms of the -\nin terms of how complex this is.\nAll you have to do is look at the second\ncertified class in this case. The district judge in this\ncase thought this was an easy statute to interpret and\napplied it to classes 1 and 3. When he got to class 2,\nwhat did he say? He said, with respect to those claims\nwith regard to part-time employment, the parties are going\nto have to sort that out themselves. He made no attempt\nto sort -- to resolve that issue because it is a\ncompletely imponderable question under their\ninterpretation of section 1658.\nQUESTION: All right. Look -- look at your own\ninterpretation. Answer this one if you can. I mean, I\ndon't know. I'm just thinking about it. But Congress\npasses a new statute. It's called New, New, New.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: And it's in a special code, title 78,\njust to be new. And it says this -- and this is total new\nand here is what it is. We have a Federal cause of action\nand a claim for double damages for anyone who has been\ninjured by a robbery committed with a gun. And then it\nsays, robbery shall be defined as it is defined in title\n18, section 391. And now, a gun -- that's new here, but\nwe define that -- you see what I'm doing?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Of course.\nQUESTION: I'm just reproducing.\nNow, how are you going to take that? Is that\nnew, new, new?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Of course, that's a new, new, new\ncause of action.\nQUESTION: All right. Of course, it is.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But -\nQUESTION: Well, but it refers to the old one,\nyou see.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But, of course, that doesn't\nchange -\nQUESTION: We get three of the elements from -\nwhat?\nMR. PHILLIPS: But that doesn't change anything,\nJustice Breyer. Of course, you can refer back to it. The\nquestion is are all of the elements of the cause of action\nindependently provided for in the New, New, New statute,\nand the answer is yes.\nQUESTION: But you can do it by a cross\nreference. In other words, in your view, if it's done to\n-- through a cross reference, they are still new, new,\nnew, but it's done by a physical placement, it's old, old,\nold.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think it's that\nsimple, Justice Breyer. If it's done where Congress means\nto create a new infrastructure and a new cause of action,\nit's new, new, new. When Congress does nothing more than\nengraft and doesn't even remotely modify the existing\ninfrastructure, it doesn't even so much as change the\nwords of a statute that's been here from 1866, to suggest\nthat this is a -- a suit that arises solely under -- under\na 1991 amendment seems to me wrong.\nThe -- the other point I think it's important to\nmake in this connection -- and -- and it's the rule of\nconstruction that seems to get lost sight of -- is -- and\n-- and it's the one this Court adopted in Wilson v. Garcia\n-- is that there is no reason to assume that Congress\nwould mean for the -- to have two causes -- two statutes\nof limitation apply to the same cause of action when it\nwas interpreting section 1983.\nAnd here we have a situation where you will have\ntwo -- two statutes of limitation applying to the same\nwords in the same subsection of a statute. And we raised\nthe issue in our -- in our brief for the respondent\nsaying, find us a statute where Congress has ever allowed\nthat kind of morass to exist, and -- and the reply brief\nis utterly silent on that. And for good cause, because\nthere is no reason to assume that Congress would have\nadopted that interpretation. And therefore, if you follow\nthe rule of construction from Wilson v. Garcia and if you\naccept what I think you cannot help but except, which is\nthat arising under is not an unambiguous line -\nQUESTION: Do you think there may be an equal\nprotection problem there?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well -\nQUESTION: When a person says, you know, I -- I\ncan sue within 4 years. Somebody else can only sue within\n2 because I am -- I am an employee above 25 and -- and I\nonly got my cause of action later. And -- and the one\nreason for the difference is my statute was enacted later\nthan yours.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Is it irrational? Yes. Is it\nunconstitutional? Probably not under the standards that\nloosely govern these kinds of issues unless somebody can\nattach it to some kind of -\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips, would this be a\ndifferent case if instead of enacting the statute it did\nin 1991, they -- they simply had an amendment that said in\naddition to the coverage of the preexisting 1981, we will\nadd the additional brand new cause of action which will\nallow recovery for what happens after you get on the job?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think if there were a 1981(d)\nthat was -- that was separately contained and that\nexpressed a clear indication from Congress that it really\nmeant to create a new cause of action, that it would make\nsense under those circumstances for 1658 to apply to that\nparticular situation.\nBut I think what we're talking about here is\nsimply trying to ascertain Congress' intent, and I think\nwhether you look at it under section 1981's lens or if you\nlook at it under section 1658's lens, you end up at\nexactly the same point.\nQUESTION: But -- but your answer seems to me to\nsuggest that if the statute has the same substantive\neffect, you get one result in one form of -- type of\ndrafting and a different result with a different type of\ndrafting.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's -- to be sure. And it\ngoes back, I suppose, to the argument that was made by the\nother side which is that there's a default rule and\nCongress can always change it. The core of this is\nCongress can always make its intent more explicit in terms\nof how it deals with the problem. The question is, do you\nwant to create a regime in which this Court is going to\nhave to be resolving questions involving the meaning of\nsection 1658 for the foreseeable future?\nOr doesn't it make sense to recognize that there\nis, in fact, a -- a complete set of causes of action to\nwhich 1658 will routinely apply and that it will be spared\n-- the courts will be spared and the litigants will be\nspared the burden of having to sort out these kinds of\nissues on a going-forward basis and recognize that we're\nnot going to pick up everything in the interim?\nBut as Congress wants to go forward and create\nnew causes of action, the opportunity will arise, and it\ncan do so. But if it chooses to engraft it on an existing\ninfrastructure, then it seems to me under those\ncircumstances, what the Court should do is say these cause\nof action arises at this point in time. It doesn't arise\nbecause of the new statute. It's a much simpler, much\ncleaner way of dealing with the issue.\nAnd -- and that's the one point I did want to\nmake. I don't -- I have not heard the other side remotely\ncomplain that our approach has any of the kinds of\ncomplications. I'm not saying it's without issues, but\nit's nowhere near the complications -\nQUESTION: No, but it has the -- it has the\ncomplications that -- that preexisted in trying to figure\nout which State law applies and so forth and so on. It\nsays that regime still survives in a lot of areas that it\nwould not survive if you take their side.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But -- but Congress clearly\nrecognized that it was not prepared to eliminate that\nregime because -- because it would --\nQUESTION: It seems to me that -\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- would have created all kinds\nof problems on a retroactive basis. It didn't want to -\nit didn't want to unsettle expectations.\nQUESTION: But it seems to me that to the extent\nyou are changing that regime, you're -- you're bringing\nmore certainty to the law because that is an inherently\nconfusing regime.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well you bring one form of -- of\ncomplication and one form of -- of clarity to it. But at\nleast the -- it's the clarity you know rather than the\nclarity you don't know -- or the confusion that you don't\nknow at this point. Courts have been dealing with the\nquestion of how to borrow for a long time. The question\nof how you're going to deal with section 1658 and what\nconflicts in the circuits you're going to have to resolve\nand what happens when Congress makes minor modifications\n-- Congress makes lots of minor modifications in every -\nQUESTION: Why -- why wouldn't all these\nproblems exist with your system just as much if all that\nhas to happen to make it valid under your system is we\ntake these same words, making appropriate modification,\nstick them in title 75 and call it New, New, New? I mean,\nat that point we're going to have the same problem with\nthe 15 versus the 25, wouldn't we? I mean -\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't -- I don't think so,\nJustice Breyer, because -\nQUESTION: Why not? Because it would only apply\nto the 25, you see -- or the 15. It wouldn't apply to the\n25.\nMR. PHILLIPS: It will -- whatever the New, New,\nNew statute is, that will be subject to the -- to the\nstatute of -- the 4-year statute of limitations.\nQUESTION: That's right.\nMR. PHILLIPS: There's no retroactivity issue\nyou need to worry about in that -\nQUESTION: No, but since it's the same language,\nyou see we discover that small industry would be subject\nto the 4-year statute, but the larger firm would be\nsubject to the old statute, just exactly what you're\ncomplaining about under their interpretation.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But -- but if --\nQUESTION: Am I wrong about that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think you are wrong about that.\nI think all -- if Congress has created a new statute, it\n-- it has told you that this is one that's subject to -\nto the 4-year statute of limitations period on a going-\nforward basis, and I think it's eliminated any of the\nconfusion.\nAnd certainly Congress knows -- would know how\nto do that if the Court were very clear in saying what\nwe're going to apply 1658 to is to new causes of action\nthat are specifically stated with an entire infrastructure\ncreated to provide for them. I don't think they have to\ndo it in a new title 79 or whatever, but they clearly have\nto do it by doing more than simply changing the definition\nof a single set of terms in a statute that is otherwise\nleft utterly unchanged under these circumstances.\nIf there are no other questions, Your Honors,\nI'd urge you to affirm.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Phillips.\nMr. Newsom, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN C. NEWSOM\nON BEHALF OF THE FOR ALABAMA, ET AL.,\nAS AMICI CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. NEWSOM: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAs perhaps the most frequent litigants in suits\nalleging violations of Federal law, the States and their\nofficers have an overriding interest in this case in\nensuring that section 1658 is construed to establish a\nclear and easily discernible rule.\nThat in my mind leaves two options. There are\neffectively two clear options on the table. One is to\napply section 1658 to all section 1981 claims and the\nother is to -- is to continue the practice of applying\nState borrowed statutes of limitations to all of those\nclaims.\nBoth of those rules create the same level of\ncertainty, but one of those rules, namely the -- the rule\nthat would apply section 1658 to all section 1981 claims,\nis plainly inconsistent with Congress' intent and indeed\nwith the language of section 1658 itself in that it would\napply to claims that on any understanding arose under\npreexisting law. Accordingly, the State submits that the\nrespondent's position here is the best among the available\nalternatives.\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Newsom, the reason that\nCongress grandfathered the claims that already existed, as\nMr. Phillips said, was because of expectations that I'm\noff the hook after 2 years, say. That -- that doesn't\nexist when a right is created, a right to relief, that\ndidn't exist before.\nMR. NEWSOM: Well, I think the -- the\nexpectations that Congress sought to protect in -- in\nsection 1658 were expectations with respect to certain\ncategories of claims. In enacting section 1658 Congress\nrecognized that there were certain categories of claims\nthat had developed established limitations rules. For\ninstance, under this Court's then-recent decisions in\nWilson v. Garcia and Goodman v. Lukens Steel, section 1983\nclaims as a -- as a category and section 1981 claims as a\ncategory were both subject to single borrowed State\nstatutes of limitations. So I think the expectation that\nCongress sought to protect was the expectation of a\nlitigant that I have a 1981 claim and it will be subject\nto the following statute of limitations.\nSo I think the -- that -- I mean, it sounds to\nme that there is agreement this morning that -- that the\nappropriate test to apply is the test whether or not\nCongress has created a new cause of action. I think the\nclearest evidence that Congress has done that, that\nCongress has created a new cause of action, is where\nCongress creates and enacts an entirely new, separate\nstatutory section. And again, contrary to petitioners'\nsuggestions -- and Justice Kennedy is quite right -- there\nare numerous times that Congress has, since December 1 of\n1990, created an entirely new and freestanding causes of\naction to which section 1658 would certainly apply.\nNow, Congress' choice in the 1991 Civil Rights\nAct not to create a new statutory section and instead to\n-- to work within the four corners of section 1981 and to\n-- to fine tune the existing cause of action that already\nexisted in section 1981 is a strong indication -\nQUESTION: How can you say it's fine tuning an\nexisting cause of action if the plaintiff couldn't have\nrecovered before the 1991 amendment?\nMR. NEWSOM: Well, I think the -- the key\nconsideration here is that Congress had a choice in the\n1991 act how it would respond to this Court's decision in\nPatterson. It was acting against a very specific\nbackdrop.\nQUESTION: Would you agree with Mr. Phillips if\nthey'd written a different statute that came out with\nexactly the same result, but they just said -- it would\nnot -- not redefine words but simply said, in addition to\nwhat you can already do you, you may also recover for what\nhappens on the job?\nMR. NEWSOM: I agree with Mr. Phillips, and\nhaving -- having just said that the strongest indication\nof Congress' intent to create a new cause of action would\nbe its creation of an entirely new statutory scheme, I do\nagree that as -- as Congress moves away from that\nparadigm, that it may, for instance, in a freestanding\nsection 1981(d), if it enacts all of the elements of a new\n-- of a new claim, that yes, indeed, that would create a\nnew cause of action within -- within the meaning of\nsection 1658.\nQUESTION: But if it had done that, then we'd\nstill have the same problems of deciding whether the -- a\nparticular -- like class 2 in this case, whether they come\nunder one section rather than the other. You'd have that\nproblem then.\nMR. NEWSOM: I'm not -- I'm not sure that that's\nexactly right. The problem with class 2 -- and tell me if\nI'm misunderstanding. The problem with class 2 is that\nclass 2 rises or falls on a given set of -- on a given set\nof facts. The district court did not conclude whether\nthis class of -- this class of plaintiffs' promotion and\nassignment claims would succeed on a specific set of\nfacts. The problem -- and that we think is the -- the\nproblem inherent in petitioners' position that ties the\nquestion of whether a new cause of action has been created\nto the viability of a given claim rather than looking, as\nsection -- as section 1658 directs the Court to do, what\n-- to -- to whether or not a civil action is created. A\ncivil action in my mind speaks to your ticket into court,\nnot so much with respect to what happens to you once you\nget there. So -\nQUESTION: I -- I suppose any suggestion that we\nwould be creating a -- a problem for Congress in giving it\n-- in posing a dilemma for it is that they can provide,\nnumber one, a new statute and have the statute of\nlimitations set forth specifically.\nMR. NEWSOM: Well, that's certainly true. Any\n-- I -- I certainly agree that any rule this Court adopts\ncould be superseded by a subsequent amendment of -- of an\nenactment by Congress. But in the meantime, this Court we\nthink ought to adopt a rule that minimizes confusion and\n-- and maximizes certainty. That, in essence, is -- is\nthe -- is the -- the proposition coming out of this\nCourt's decision in Wilson v. Garcia, as Mr. Phillips\nsaid, which is that in that case, Justice O'Connor, for\ninstance, made a very good point in her dissent that -- in\nthat 1983 claims run the gamut from police brutality\nclaims on the one hand to -- to school desegregation cases\non the other and thought that it just didn't make sense to\napply a single statute of limitations to such a wide\nvariety of claims.\nAnd this Court held -- and I submit correctly -\nthat the practical considerations, those of maximizing\ncertainty and minimizing litigation, required the\nenactment -- or the -- the imposition\ncategorical, some would surely say formalistic, statute of\nlimitations. And the same practical considerations\nobtained here at least -\nQUESTION: It's also true, is it not, that this\nis one of those unique cases in which the -- the 4-year\nrule will help some plaintiffs and help defendants in\nother cases because some of the State statutes for certain\ncauses are actually longer than 4 years? So sometimes\nit's cutting it down and sometimes it's expanding it.\nMR. NEWSOM: That's certainly right.\nAnd the State's principal interest here is in --\nis in a -- a clear statute of limitations, not necessarily\nthe shortest statute of limitations. Our interest here is\n-- is principally in clarity.\nSo again, if I can just emphasize, Congress -\nCongress acted in section -- or rather in the 1991 act\nagainst a very specific backdrop, namely this Court's\nthen-recent decision in Goodman v. Lukens Steel, which\nheld that a -- that a single borrowed State statute of\nlimitations would apply to all section 1981 claims. Now,\nif Congress wanted to walk away from Goodman and create a\nnew cause of action so as to trigger section 1658's 4\nyear statute, then our submission is then it had to be\nclear about what it was doing. It had to -- in the\nparadigmatic example, it had to\nsection. At the very least, it had to create a -- a self-\ncontained and freestanding civil action within the\nconfines of section 1681. But where it merely defined the\nterm in a preexisting cause of action, we submit that that\nis simply not clear enough to -- to apply the -- the 4\nyear statute.\nIf there are no further questions.\nQUESTION: One other question, if I may. Are\nthere other statutes like -- that have just made a\nsubstantive amendment merely by redefining a term? I\nthink this is kind of a -- this is kind of an unusual\nstatute and it may be a very unusual problem we've got.\nMR. NEWSOM: There may well be Justice Stevens.\nnot that I'm aware of off the top of my head.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Newsom.\nMs. Gorman, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF H. CANDACE GORMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. GORMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJustice Stevens, if I can answer your last\nquestion. Yes, there was another statute that I can think\nof and that's the Pregnancy Discrimination Act although\nthis is before 1990. So the 1658 question doesn't come\ninto play. But title VII was amended just to add that\ncause of action for pregnancy discrimination -\nQUESTION: And did they do it -- did that\nstatute do it just by redefining a term, redefining -\nMS. GORMAN: Correct, Your Honor, by redefining\ndiscrimination based on sex to also include discrimination\nin pregnancy.\nQUESTION: Yes. That was in response to our\nGilbert case.\nMS. GORMAN: Correct.\nYour Honor, defendant raised two statutes that\nthey -- that they could now point to that they said would\nbenefit from section 1658. They pointed to the Muhammad\nAli Boxing Act and the anti-discrimination law. And I\nsubmit to this Court, as Justice Breyer said, those aren't\ngoing to be new acts either because if you look at those\nacts, they're actually amending previous acts, and they\npull definitional terms out of previous acts from before\n1990.\nIf defendant's interpretation is accepted by\nthis Court, then we are basically saying section 1658 is a\nnullity because we have scoured the statutes enacted by\nCongress after December 1st, 1990 and we could not find\none statute that would benefit from section 1658, because\nCongress often takes terms or definitions or causes of\naction from previous statutes and amends, even when it\nthinks it's creating or it looks like\nsomething brand new.\nQUESTION: I -- I don't know what you're saying\nwhen you say it takes it from them. Do you mean it just\ncopies them in the new act? Are you counting situations\nin which they recite it in the new legislation?\nMS. GORMAN: Correct, Your Honor, where they\ntake -\nQUESTION: Well, I don't think -\nMS. GORMAN: -- terms out of the new -- out of\nold legislation.\nQUESTION: I don't think your opponent would --\nwould count them. I -- I think only if -- if you rely\nupon the earlier statute for the definition, not if you\nsimply copy that definition in the new statute, I don't\nthink he would consider that to be covered.\nMS. GORMAN: Well, Your Honor, if that's the\ncase, then I think what respondent must be suggesting then\nis that section 1658 would only come into play if the new\nstatute was the only statute you were relying on. And I\ndon't think that's what section 1658 is stating. I think\nif -- even if this Court says, we're relying on old\nsection 1981, as well as 1981 as amended by the Civil\nRights -- Civil Rights Act, clearly our claim is still\ndependent on the 1991 act and therefore section 1658 would\nstill come into play.\nAnd as far as confusion, defendant suggested\nthat there was even confusion in this case because the\njudge in our case did not know if class 2 claims were\ncovered by this section 1658. There is no confusion with\nthe court. It just wasn't briefed before the court.\nThere was no record before the court because we had asked\nfor a slightly different definition in our class\ncertification, and the judge went beyond that definition\nand established a different class for the class 2. So the\njudge just didn't have the record and he thought we could\nfigure that, which I think we probably could. And I think\nthe answer is going to be that the class 2 claims also\nfall under the 1658 statute.\nThe question before this Court is a narrow one:\ndoes section 1658 apply to plaintiffs' cause of action for\nracial discrimination and termination? Those claims were\nnot created until the 1991 Civil Rights Act, and I submit\nto the Court that section 1658 should apply to those\nclaims.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Gorman.\n"
