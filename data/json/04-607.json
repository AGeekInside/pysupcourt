        "content": "(11:12 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument in number\n04-607, Laboratory Corporation of America against Metabolite\nLaboratories.\nMr. Franklin, whenever you're ready, you may\nproceed.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FRANKLIN: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe patent claim at issue in this case was\nheld to be infringed whenever any doctor looks at a\nhomocysteine test result and reflexively thinks about a\nbasic natural correlation. The result has been multimillion\ndollar damages and an injunction prohibiting a testing\ncompany from conducting important homocysteine tests by any\nmethod and for any reason whatsoever.\nAs broadly construed by the Federal Circuit,\nthis claim is invalid as a matter of law for two closely\nrelated reasons. It contravenes both of this Court's\nsettled proscription against effectively patenting laws of\nnature or natural phenomena as well as the requirement that\na patent must fully and clearly describe, disclose and\nenable an actual invention and must not sweep so far as to\nencompass more than what was actually invented.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that second point -- is\nthat second point definiteness?\nMR. FRANKLIN: The second point is\ndefiniteness, it's enablement.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does definiteness describe\nthis second aspect that you've just --\nMR. FRANKLIN: It describes part of it, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just part of it.\nMR. FRANKLIN: There is definiteness, there is\nenablement, there is written description. We think all of\nthose are contravened here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's examine them. What if\nit definitely goes so far as to allow no other use of this\nnatural law that it's discovered? It definitely goes that\nfar, isn't definiteness fully satisfied?\nMR. FRANKLIN: I think not, Your Honor,\nbecause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No?\nMR. FRANKLIN: -- definiteness would still\nrequire that you distinctly claim an invention here and\nthat's one of the things that's absent in this case. But\neven moving beyond that, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's indefinite because we\ndon't know where our thoughts will take us? Suppose there a\npatent which requires looking at the clouds in the sky for\n10 minutes. I mean, that's maybe absurd, but it's certainly\ndefinite.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, Your Honor, if it is\ndefinite, then it is certainly not enabling of an actual\ninvention. And here the Morse case, which we have cited in\nour briefs, comes into play. In that case, the court held\nthat Samuel Morse was entitled to patent his innovative\ntelegraph but he couldn't go further to effectively patent\nthe law of nature or natural phenomenon associated with it\nand thereby monopolize all manner of devices and processes\nthat he did not invent and did not enable or describe.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But wasn't the issue there\nwhat is patentable? I mean this case in the district court\nwas under this definiteness idea, 112. 101 deals with\nwhat's patentable. And it seems to me that you -- this case\nwas presented as a definiteness case.\nMR. FRANKLIN: But it was not just\ndefiniteness, Your Honor. It was section 112. But let me\nget to the Morse case because as we have explained in our\nreply brief and, in fact, in our opening brief, the Morse\ncase was in fact decided under what is now section 112. The\nCourt cited and quoted the relevant statute which has not\nchanged in any material respect today. The Court made clear\nthat the problem in that case, at page 120 of the opinion,\nwas that Morse claims what he has not described in the\nmanner required by law.\nAnd what we have here is the same situation.\nWe have these patentees who are indisputably entitled to\npatent their innovative method for measuring homocysteine.\nAnd LabCorp continues to use that method sometimes and we\npay royalties whenever we use that method. But what they\ncouldn't do is what Samuel Morse tried to do and push the\nenvelope, and try to effectively patent the natural\nphenomenon associated with all homocysteine tests and\nthereby gain a monopoly over just not the one that they\ninvented, not just those that are in the prior art, which\nitself would be impermissible, but even yet to be invented\nassays.\nAnd here is the nub of this case. LabCorp has\nsought to use but has been penalized for using and is\nprevented from using a more efficient and cost-effective\nmethod for assaying homocysteine than the one that these\npatentees invented. The method that LabCorp seeks to use,\nwhich is the Abbott method, reduces the processing time for\nhomocysteine tests down from what was up to 18 hours under\nthe patentee's method down to a manner of minutes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the Abbott test -- that's\npatented and you're paying royalties for that?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Actually, I don't know, Your\nHonor. And, I just don't know whether it's patented but it\nis certainly not covered by their claims 1 through 12, which\nhave never been -- well, the district court found that those\nclaims didn't apply here, and that's not an issue.\nThe Abbott method is different. It's an\nimmunoassay. It is not the same kind of mass spectometry\ngas chromatograph method that they have described. It's\nmuch more efficient, it's much more cost-effective and the\nreason obviously that LabCorp wants to use that method is to\nmore effectively serve patients and their doctors and to\nmeet the burgeoning demand for homocysteine tests. But\nbecause these patentees have effectively claimed the patent\non the natural correlation that's associated with all\nhomocysteine tests, they have prevented LabCorp from using\nwhat the patent laws would seek to encourage, that is, a\nmore cost-effective, innovative, different method, the kind\nof thing -- exactly the kind of thing that the Court was\nconcerned about in Morse.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The opinion of the Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit in the appendix begins\ndiscussion of claim 13 about page 16a. Are there some, one\nor two sentences there or a paragraph that you can tell me\nis completely wrong?\nMR. FRANKLIN: In the Federal Circuit's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. You're asking us to\nreverse this court of appeals decision and I'm looking, and\nparticularly with reference to claim 13, the one we're\ntalking about, I assume, and I'm looking through pages, say,\n16 and 21 to find something that's absolutely wrong.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, I think what --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You want me to tell the court\nof appeals, well, you can't do this. But where is it wrong?\nMR. FRANKLIN: I think where it's wrong, Your\nHonor, is that it proceeds from an assumption that is wrong\nin itself and that is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you can't point me to any\nparticular sentence that -- that's absolutely wrong?\nMR. FRANKLIN: I think that the argument in --\nthe Federal Circuit's decision is wrong in its enablement\ndiscussion, it's wrong in its written description\ndiscussion. I mean, just to take one, the written\ndescription posits that this is a valid written description\nbecause the inventors, as the Federal Circuit says in its\nopinion, possessed the correlating step. And I think what's\nwrong about that, Your Honor, is that nobody can possess the\ncorrelation. And that's the nub of this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And where does it say this?\nMR. FRANKLIN: I'm sorry, that is at page -- I\nbelieve it's at 17 of the appendix. Let me just make sure\nI've got the right -- and that was when it talks\nabout --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You see my point? I'm not\nsure what it is you want me to say went wrong, other than\nthe fact that this patent is, should never have been granted\nto begin with but that wasn't raised.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, I think it was raised,\nYour Honor. The validity issue was raised in the district\ncourt, it was raised on appeal. The district court had\nconstrued the patent as requiring -- and part of the\ndistrict court's claim construction addressed the issue as\nto whether or not one could patent a law of nature or\neffectively patent a scientific idea. The district court\nsaid this patent must require something more, and that is at\njoint appendix page 60. It must require something more than\nsimple existence of the relationship between homocysteine\nand vitamin deficiencies. And one of the places that the\nFederal Circuit did get it wrong, Your Honor, was in\nabandoning that limitation that the district court had\nimposed on the patent.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I guess that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you're arguing now, as I\nunderstand it, that the reason you win on definiteness is\nthat it sweeps in even as yet uninvented processes.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And it does so by means, in\neffect, of erecting this umbrella of a natural fact which is\nintended to cover every process that might be relevant to\nestablishing that natural fact.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that you're saying we\ncannot -- no court can decide definiteness in this situation\nwithout hitting the patentable issue.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Absolutely, Your Honor. That's\nexactly what we're arguing. And that's where the Federal\nCircuit got it wrong. And we did in fact urge the Court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you told the -- you said,\njudge, if you in fact hold that this claim 13 satisfies\nsection 112 and is sufficiently precise and specific and\nconcise, if you hold that, then the claim would violate\nMorse?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes, it would violate --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you argued that\nspecifically? And so your problem -- I guess that you said\nthat. I mean, you quote it in your supplementary brief on\npage 6.\nMR. FRANKLIN: We did say that. Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it's the language.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what it said. It\ndidn't say Morse. It said Diehr.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Diehr, which --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Dier incorporates Morse.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: As was my understanding.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So your complaint about the\nparagraph on 17a is that it did not deal with that\nargument.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I imagine they'll say that\nsimply mentioning it in an oral argument is not enough to\nget us to think seriously about it.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, it was in the brief, Your\nHonor, and I think that it was also in, with the premise of\neverything that we argued, because the district court had\nalready -- and again, I point the Court to joint appendix\npage 60. The district court had already held that it had to\nmean -- the patent had to mean something more than the\nsimple relationship, the simple existence of the\nrelationship between elevated homocysteine and vitamin\ndeficiencies. And the premise of the entire Federal Circuit\nargument and, in fact, to the arguments below was that we\ndon't know what that anything is, because the patent doesn't\ntell you.\nThe Federal Circuit blew past that, Your Honor,\nand what the Federal Circuit said, which makes the issue\nfront and center now, is the Federal Circuit said, and this\nis at 18a. \"The correlating step is a simple conclusion\nthat a cobalamin/folate deficiency exists vel non based on\nthe assaying step.\"\nAnd what that means is now, as a result of the\nFederal Circuit's decision, unlike the district court's\ndecision, we now know that every homocysteine test\nautomatically infringes because every doctor will\nreflexively look at it and think about the phenomenon\nassociated with it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You set off the district\ncourt and the court of appeals but you don't think the\ndistrict court got it right, either. You said the district\ncourt required something more.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the something more\nand why wasn't that adequate?\nMR. FRANKLIN: We don't know and that's why it\nwasn't adequate. That's why we had always argued under\nindefiniteness and under enablement, under written\ndescription. We had no idea. The patent doesn't tell you.\nWe suggested one way. That wasn't -- the Federal Circuit\ndidn't agree with us. The problem with the district\ncourt's -- we agreed with the district court's claim\nconstruction. That far, we did. But then there was nothing\nmore even adduced at trial, and this was the argument we\nconsistently made. The Federal Circuit then abandoned what\nthe district court did and then we here have it front and\ncenter with the patent --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What the district court did\nis it got, it tried this case and it got a rather large jury\nverdict.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And I don't understand how\nyou're setting off the district court from the court of\nappeals when the court of appeals, whatever it said, it\naffirmed the judgment of the district court.\nMR. FRANKLIN: It did, but the claim\nconstruction is the part of what I'm talking about. At page\n60, I'll just read what the district court said.\n\"Correlating is a verb and must mean more than the simple\nexistence of a relationship between a high level\nhomocysteine and deficiency in cobalamin or folate.\"\nThe Federal Circuit's opinion is contrary to\nthat, Your Honor, and that's where this whole issue gets put\nfront and center now. And what we have here under the\nFederal Circuit's extraordinarily broad construction is we\nhave nothing more than the reflexive mental recognition of a\nnatural correlation preceded by the inherent and generic\nstep of somehow ascertaining the input for that correlation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I could see how that broad\ninterpretation would raise perhaps for the -- clearly raise\nfor the first time the section 101 issue. But, so that\nshould have been clear to you by the time the court of\nappeals decision came out, right? But did you, in your\npetition here, rely on 101?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, we relied, Your Honor, on\nall of -- many, many cases in court interpreting that\nprovision and others under the law of nature doctrine --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You never mentioned 101,\nthough, did you?\nMR. FRANKLIN: We didn't but just as an\nexample, Your Honor. The court's invitation or, to the\nsolicitor general didn't mention 101, but everybody knew\nwhat the court was talking about. And let me just -- the\npetition couldn't have raised -- the petition squarely\nraised the issue. On page 18, we cited Diamond versus\nDiehr, Benson, Funk Brothers, Mackay Radio and the Le Roy\ncase from 1852. On page 26, we cited, quoted, relied on\nFunk Brothers and Mackay Radio again. Page 27 refers back\nto the authorities at page 18 of the petition. Page 28\nstates that under the Federal Circuit's holding, anyone who\nclaims to be the first to discover scientific correlation\ncould patent it simply by drafting the vague test plus\ncorrelate claim.\nThis issue was presented in the petition. It\nis within the question presented. And, Your Honor, I think\nthat the issue is easy to resolve given the Federal\nCircuit's broad construction. Under that construction,\nagain, there is nothing more than the recognition of the\nnatural phenomenon preceded by what is the inherent step in\nany natural correlation of ascertaining the input. And as\nwe have said without contradiction in the opening brief, if\nthis patent is valid, then anyone can gain a patent over a\nscientific correlation by doing this kind of artful\ndrafting. Einstein could have patented E=MC2 which this\nCourt has stated on more than one occasion could not be\npatented simply by doing a test plus correlate.\nTo take another hypothetical that was stated in\nthe opening brief without contradiction, if I discover\ntomorrow a new correlation between having a certain kind of\nblood type and a medical condition that heretofore people do\nnot know about, I could run down to the Patent Office,\npatent that correlation and the effect of that would be to\nmonopolize all blood typing, no matter whether it's done\nthrough methods in the prior art or methods yet to be\ndeveloped.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is it true as the Respondents\nargue that a holding in your favor would call into question\nthousands of patents?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, they don't mention all --\nthe number but I don't think it would call into question a\nhuge swath of patents. It would call into question patents\nthat are like this one, obviously, things that are simply\ntest plus correlate.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And do you have any idea how\nmany there are of those?\nMR. FRANKLIN: No. You would have to do an\nexhaustive search. There are some and I believe that some\nof the ones that the Respondents cite, some of the claims --\nand let's distinguish between patents and claims here,\nbecause it might invalidate some claims in some patents,\nwhich is not unusual because patent drafters often push the\nenvelope. They patent this -- in this case, they have\nindisputably unchallenged and valid patent claims for a\nmethod of measuring homocysteine, but they went further in\nclaim 13. And to the extent there are other patents that\nmight have those kind of claims, yes. But to the extent\nwe're talking about the broader swath of patents dealing\nwith things like genes, no.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if that's -- if there is\nsome likelihood or possibility of this that we should assess,\nit seems to me that it's imprudent for us to discuss it here\nwhen it hasn't been discussed in the court of appeals.\nMR. FRANKLIN: I think, well, it was, again, it\nwas pressed in the court of appeals. But again, what we're\ntalking about is deciding this case on its facts and\nobviously to the extent there are other patents that are\njust like this one, and the court has addressed this in the\ncontext of Flook and Diehr and has distinguished between\nthose patents which facially looked rather similar but the\ncourt was able to draw the distinctions. The Federal\nCircuit can draw the distinctions.\nBut if it is a patent that is simply like this\none, which claims nothing more than a natural correlation\npreceded by the inherent step of ascertaining the input, no\ncourt, to my knowledge, has ever upheld such a patent before\nthis case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're urging on us something\nlike plain error, is about what you're telling us.\nMR. FRANKLIN: No, I think that we're urging\nthe Court to examine the case that it has before it, look at\nthe patent and we're not asking the Court to go further than\nthis patent. Look at this patent, look at the Federal\nCircuit's construction and that's something that we will\ntake as a given for purposes of today's proceeding.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're saying this patent, you\nreally mean just claim 13, don't you?\nMR. FRANKLIN: I'm -- excuse me, Justice. And\nagain, I wanted, as I was saying to Justice Alito, you do\nneed to distinguish between patents and claims. And claim\n13 is the only claim that's been asserted here. It's the\nonly claim that's being challenged. And let me just --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why shouldn't we do what the\nSolicitor General proposed, that is, since we don't know for\nsure, at least I don't know for sure, I'm not enough of a\nscientist --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- whether in fact the section\n112 determination, as made by the Federal court, excludes all\nother possible use of this natural phenomenon.\nSince I don't know that for sure, why shouldn't\nI tell the Federal Circuit, you know, your definition of\ncorrelate raises this issue and you should resolve whether\nit is true that there is no other possible usefulness for\nthis, no substantial usefulness?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Quite simply, Your Honor, it's\nbecause the Court doesn't need to reach that issue and\ndidn't need to reach it in any of its prior cases save one\nand that's the Benson case where that issue came up really\nin one sentence of the opinion. In the Morse case, in the\nFunk Brothers case, in the Flook case, all of those patents\nhad -- were limited to a particular use.\nJust take Morse's patent which was limited to\njust conveying information at a distance through\nelectromagnetism. That was actually one very small sliver\nof what you can do with electromagnetism. In fact, very,\nvery small. And the Court said, no, it doesn't matter.\nWhere what you have is effectively the patent on the\ncorrelation, it doesn't matter whether you've limited it to\none use or many uses. So if the Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. FRANKLIN: -- so I don't think the Court\nneeds to get into that. In Diehr, the Court made that\nexplicit that a field of use -- limiting a patent to a\nfield of use is not going to save that patent from\ninvalidity.\nNow, if the Court does examine the issue, it\nought to do it the way it did it in Benson just by looking\nat the broad sweep here. And how I would use it, Your\nHonor, would be to say that in addition to all of the other\nproblems that this patent, as construed by the Federal\nCircuit, has, it also has an extraordinarily broad\npre-emptive sweep. It applies to any homocysteine test, no\nmatter how it's done, no matter what reason it's done, no\nmatter if it's in the prior art, no matter if I invent it\ntomorrow.\nIt applies to any act of even looking at the\ntest. And here it's not just doctors. If anyone in the\naudience today learns about this correlation because of this\nargument, if they're listening carefully, and then they go\nto their doctor and ask for a test, they will, number one,\nbe inducing infringement; number two, if they look at the\ntest result, now being armed with what we have given them,\nwhich is the scientific knowledge that the correlation\nexists, they will infringe. And there was testimony in\ntrial to that effect.\nSo I don't think the Court needs to get into\nthe inquiry, and I don't think the Patent Office really\nwants to get into that inquiry either. To have to look at\neach patent application to determine not just based on\nwhat's in it whether it's valid but whether there are other\nuses not even invented yet that might not be covered.\nThat's not, I submit, what the Patent Office would like to\ndo.\nIf I might reserve the remainder of my time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You may, Mr. Franklin.\nI think Mr. Hungar is next, Mr. Estrada.\nMR. ESTRADA: Oh, sorry, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're too hungry,\nMr. Estrada.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Hungar.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AS AMICUS CURIAE\nMR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and\nmay it please the Court:\nClaim 13 satisfies the written description,\nenablement and definiteness requirements of section 112 of\nthe patent act. The patent specification sets forth the\nscope and nature of the claimed invention in terms readily\nunderstandable by a person of ordinary skill in the art and\nit enables such persons to practice the claimed invention.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you agree or you submit\nthat you can have a definite description of something that's\nunpatentable because it's too broad?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, that obviously assumes the\nconclusion, Your Honor. But with respect to the\ndefiniteness requirement, the challenge seems to be that\nbecause the first step of claim 13 is not limited to a\nparticular type of assay but instead claims all assays, that\nthat somehow renders it indefinite, and that argument is\nsimply incorrect as this Court has recognized for over a\nhundred years.\nIn the Cochrane against Deener case, for\nexample, the Court addressed that question where a process\nclaim was not limited to a particular method of performing a\nparticular step of the process, and the Court said quote, \"A\nprocess may be patentable irrespective of the particular\nform of the instrumentalities used\", closed quote. And the\nCourt reiterated that principle in the Diehr case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But, but, but -- well, let's\nassume that there is a claim that includes something that\nshould not be patentable, because it's too broad or it\ninvolves the scientific phenomena, the mechanics of the\nuniverse. Can a patent still be definite if it includes\nthat sort of unpatentable claim?\nMR. HUNGAR: It can be. It might or might not\nbe depending on the circumstances. The Morse case is an\nexample where it was both indefinite and invalid because\ntrying to claim a principle of nature, in effect. But by\nthe same token you can easily have, and in fact you have\nhere, a claim where it's definite in that persons of\nordinary skill in the art understand the scope of the\nclaims. They know what is and is not within the scope of\nthe patent, which is, in this case, a question entirely\nseparate from the question whether, as construed by the\nCourt and as understood by the person of ordinary skill in\nthe art, it's valid, under section 101, that is, under the\nscope of patentable subject matter.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What do you think about its\nvalidity under 101?\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, as we suggested in our\nbrief, we don't think that that question is properly before\nthe Court but that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand, but I didn't ask\nyou what you said in your brief.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. But that if the\nCourt were to reach that question, we think that while it's\nunclear because the issue wasn't litigated, there appears to\nbe prima facie evidence of invalidity under Benson, this\nCourt's decision in Benson, because, given what we currently\nknow, it appears that the claim as construed by the court of\nappeals preempts all substantial practical applications of\nthe correlation. But because that issue wasn't litigated\nbelow, if the Court were to reach it, it should remand --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: To you read the the patent as --\ntalking about step 1, you can use any assay method you want.\nIt doesn't have to be patented. But the correlation, step 2,\nthat any time you ask a doctor to tell us what you think the\nresults of the test mean, that that's an infringement?\nMR. HUNGAR: That's how the court of appeals\nconstrued it, yes, Your Honor. I'm sorry. Is that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And is it possible that that\ncan be patentable, in your view?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, again, Your Honor, we --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If you just go to the doctor\nand ask for advice and he says, yes, I've looked at the\nresults; you've got a vitamin B deficiency or whatever it\nis --\nMR. HUNGAR: As we indicated --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- he's committed\ninfringement under this patent as I understand it.\nMR. HUNGAR: As we indicated in our brief, we\nthink that raises a potentially serious pre-emption problem\nand it also raises the anticipation problem, that is, the\nsection 102 argument which is not before the Court but if it\nwere litigated --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It would raise the -- just\ndo you think that that patent is valid? That's what I'm\ntrying to ask you.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, we think it has validity\nproblems under section 102 and also under the pre-emption,\n-- potentially under the pre-emption doctrine. We haven't\naddressed the other issues that Petitioner seeks to put\nbefore the Court involving Diehr and Flook, both because --\nwell, actually for four reasons.\nFirst of all, it wasn't pressed or passed upon\nbelow, it wasn't -- it's not fairly included within the\nquestion presented, which construed at its most broad,\nbroadly, includes only the monopolization issue --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I know all that. I'm just\nreally interested in your view of the patent. That's what\nI'm trying to get to.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. And as I've\nsaid, we've identified two areas in which we think there are\npotentially problems if they were in front of the Court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think there is a 101\nproblem too?\nMR. HUNGAR: The preemption issue is a 101\nproblem, Your Honor. We haven't addressed -- as I said, we\nhave not taken a position on the broader section 101 issues\nand we would urge the Court not to do so as well, in a case\nin which it wasn't presented below, the Court doesn't have\nthe benefit of the lower court's assessment of that\nquestion. And given that that question implicates\nsubstantial reliance interests and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So we do have a fairly long\ndiscussion by the lower court on the infringement issue. In\norder to find infringement, they had to construe\ncorrelation.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. HUNGAR: But the Court didn't grant\ncertiorari on that question. Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't understand the\ndefiniteness doctrine. I mean, all these things in 1854 I\nguess weren't so clear. But I think the precise claim in\nSamuel Morse's case was the use of the motive power of the\nelectric current for making or printing intelligible\ncharacters. That sounds absolutely definite. Anyone can\nunderstand it.\nI thought the problem there was that although\nanyone can understand it, you can't claim something as broad\nas that. You must intend to claim something narrower. And\ninsofar as it's narrower, it isn't precise. So insofar as\nit's broad, it's too broad, but definite. And insofar as\nit's narrow, it's not there, but indefinite. Okay?\nPrecisely the claim that they raised before the\nFederal Circuit and precisely the claim -- with appropriate\ncitations, and precisely the claim in respect to which the\nFederal Circuit said nothing.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, I may have misspoken\nbefore but I think it's probably most accurate to read the\nMorse case as dealing with a written specification problem,\nthat is, the specification in claim 8, the one Your Honor is\nreferring to, didn't tell anything about the method by which\nthe principle of nature, electromagnetism, would be used.\nAll it did is describe a result, and it purported to claim\nany, any method involving any number of steps that any\ninventor might ever invent in the future, even if those\nsteps had nothing to do with -- if there was not a single\noverlapping step between that new process and Morse's\nprocess.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. And we here apply the\ncorrelation to any homocysteine test, any one here, any one\nin the future, any one that any mind might impend. What's the\ndifference?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, the difference is between\nclaiming a -- claiming all methods of achieving a particular\nresult and claiming one process for achieving that\nparticular result and then as one claiming any means of\ndoing one particular step of that process.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I apply electricity to all\nmethods of putting down letters with electricity. I apply\nthe correlation to all methods of creating a homocysteine\ntest.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, again, Your Honor, if it is\ntrue that all methods of employing the assay -- excuse me,\nall methods of employing the correlation are preempted by\nthis patent claim, then it would be invalid under section\n101. But to the extent the argument is an attempt to go\nbeyond that issue, we submit Morse doesn't support it and\nindeed this Court's decision's in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, I'm not talking about\ngoing beyond it. I just thought that line between\ndefiniteness and 101, 112, 101 is not quite so clear as I\nwould have thought, because it sounds to me relying on the\n1854 case of Samuel F. B. Morse, they're making the same\nkind of argument and, indeed, you translated Morse as a\ndefiniteness 112 argument, and yet it seemed to me that's\nthe kind of argument they're making.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. And I think it\nis more properly understood as a specification problem\nbecause, as you say, anyone can understand the scope of that\nclaim. It's just that it was not sufficiently described\nbecause he was purporting to claim any process even if it\nhad nothing to do with the process he had invented, and\nthat's not what's happening here. They claim a particular\nstep, that is, do an assay, as opposed to some other method,\nand they claim any method of doing that assay within step 1\nof the overall claim but they aren't saying -- for instance\nthe analogy would be if they had claimed we've just\ndevised one particular method of determining whether someone\nhas a vitamin deficiency and we therefore claim all other\nmethods of determining whether someone has a vitamin\ndeficiency.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, I think you've hit what\nis the problem for us. When you use the word assay, you\nassume that that is excluding certain processes. And that's\nnot clear to me. Would you explain that in greater detail?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, again, we don't know --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I thought an assay was in\neffect synonymous with any process that gets the relevant\ndata and you're using it in a more -- I think, in answering\nJustice Breyer's question, you were using it in a narrower\nsense.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I think that, as understood\nby a person having ordinary skill in the art, we -- it may\nbe. We don't know because the issue wasn't litigated.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I thought that was the\npoint of your argument, that there are assays and then there\nare other methods. Did I misunderstand you?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, no. Certainly it's\nconceivable that there are other methods and indeed the\npatent claim -- the patent specification refers to -- or\nsuggests the possibility of assaying tissue as opposed to\nfluid. The claim is limited to fluid.\nI thank the Court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Hungar.\nMr. Estrada, it's your turn now.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA\nON BEHALF OF THE ON RESPONDENTS\nMR. ESTRADA: Thank you, Justice Stevens.\nThank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:\nThis was a hard fought jury trial in which the\njury rejected everything LabCorp had to sell. That judgment\nshould be affirmed for three reasons.\nThe first is LabCorp never asked the trial\njudge or the Federal Circuit to declare this patent invalid\nunder section 101, which is an affirmative defense they had\nto plead in the answer and prove by clear and convincing\nevidence.\nSecond, they're simply wrong on the merits of\nthe 101 case under this Court's cases.\nAnd third, you can search their brief in vain\nfor a workable test for patentable subject matter that would\ninvalidate this patent and not bring complete havoc to the\npatent world by calling into question numerous diagnostic\ntests in medicine and otherwise, pharmaceuticals and other\ninventions.\nLet me deal briefly with the waiver question\nbecause we don't get a sur-reply brief and there is a lot in\nthe reply brief that I wish I could deal with at length.\nBut I think I will say that it is a collection of cropped\nquotes and very inventive characterizations of the record.\nI will give you just two examples.\nBottom of page 9, they're trying to get out of\ntheir Unitherm problem, never having this raised in the answer\nor in the rule 50. And the footnote at the bottom of the page\ndiscusses the rule 50 and states or at least suggests that this\nargument in terms was raised before the trial court, concluding\nwith the sentence, \"Respondents themselves understood LabCorp to\nhave thereby presented subject matter patentability.\" They cite\nto our brief on JMOL.\nI have that here. This is what we said. \"The\nquick answer to LabCorp's mental steps theme is that LabCorp\nnever pled it in the defense. LabCorp pled invalidity on\nthe basis of 102, 103, 112 on the grounds that the patent\nwas anticipated, obvious, indefinite, non-enabled and\nprocured by inequitable conduct. But the so-called mental\nsteps doctrine goes instead to the question whether patent\ncovers statutory subject matter. That is governed\nexclusively by section 1, 101. LabCorp has never mentioned\nthat section and has never pled the patent is invalid for\ncovering non-statutory subject matter even, in its present\nJMOL motion.\nFootnote: LabCorp failed to assert invalidity\non the basis of non-statutory subject matter in any of its\nfive answers or counterclaims or in any of its interrogatory\nresponses. None of its experts, including its patent law\nexpert, made any such assertion in any reports or testimony.\nThat gets translated in the reply brief as we understood\nthis issue was in front of the court.\nNow, we made that point in our papers. There\nwas no response saying, no, wait, district judge, this isn't\nthe case. Rule on section 101.\nNot a word.\nWe had the same exchange in the Federal Circuit\nand, once again, we pointed out this was 101, had been\nwaived six ways from Sunday. Not a response telling the\nFederal Circuit, this isn't the case, please rule. And this\nis important because you're being asked to tell trial court\nand three courts of appeals judges that they committed\nreversible error for failing to address a question that\nnobody ever asked them.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now what do you say in\nresponse to my question to the Solicitor General?\nMR. ESTRADA: Which question, Justice Breyer?\nI'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That they thought it was\nobvious, that they thought that obviously the problem here\nwith this particular claim is that it doesn't say\nspecifically which tests this principle is meant to apply\nto. So it isn't definite enough. It never occurred to\nanyone that if you tried to apply it to every test, it was\nsomehow a valid patent, so they made it in the definitive\ncontext. Because for 154 years, it's been clear that you\ncan't take a principle of nature like electricity and simply\nmake a claim for all uses of electricity to create letters.\nThat's their analogy.\nAnd they thought by referring to the cases and\nby referring to the failure to point out definitely what the\ntests were this applied to, it violated 112 because\notherwise, it wouldn't be a valid patent, which everyone in\nthe patent field would know. That's at least, I think, what\nthey're saying.\nMR. ESTRADA: I think it is wrong on the facts\nand on the law. If it was obvious all along this is an\naffirmative defense under section 282 of the patent code,\nthat must be pleaded. One certainly can't be excused for\nfailing to plead something that, dare I say, is obvious.\nBut let's deal with the Morse case.\nMr. Franklin said it's the same statute at the time.\nActually, that is not so. At the time Morse was decided,\nsection 112 and 101 were both together in section 6 of the\n1836 patent act. In 1870, Congress broke that off. That's\nimportant because in Diehr, this Court considered a similar\nissue with respect to the novelty requirement and concluded\nthat once Congress consciously wrote the novelty requirement\nout of section 101, it was inappropriate to inject, you\nknow, the novelty considerations into section 101.\nThe second answer to the Morse question,\nJustice Breyer, is that the test for definiteness is not is\nthis definite in the abstract, but is it really too broad in\nrelation to the inventive contribution as disclosed in the\nspecifications. And the contrast here that is important to\nkeep in mind is between Morse in 1854 and Alexander Graham\nBell, claim 5 of that patent.\nJust to set it up, in the Morse case, claim 8,\nit had been known for many years that it was possible to\ntransmit using the electromagnetic current but nobody knew\nhow. And in fact, this Court's ruling on page 107 says this\nwas known by men of science everywhere. And the problem was\nthat Morse discovered one particular way to transmit\ncharacters at a distance and tried to patent everything that\neverybody might ever discover using whatever means to print\nat a distance.\nAlexander Graham Bell is a good contrast.\nClaim 5. It was also known that you could use the\nelectronic current to transmit voice. People had tried and\ntried and tried and, in fact, there was somebody in Germany\nwho successfully transmitted music but not words. This is\nall in -- in the Court's opinion. Now, Graham Bell\ndiscovered that the key was to use continuous undulations in\ncurrent. Continuous undulations, not discontinuous\nundulations. And had a patent claim, claim 5, which was\nvery broad. All users of continuous undulations to transmit\nvoice or sound. The Court said that's absolutely right,\nbecause he was not trying to claim beyond his inventive\ncontribution to the art.\nNow, Drs. Stabler and Allen in this case\ndiscovered something very important which is all of the\nmedical tests that existed in the art as late as the 1880s\n-- the 1980s were wrong. People were horribly misdiagnosed.\nAnd there was a test that existed but nobody used. This is\nwhat the record was.\nThe test for existing homocysteine was almost\nnever used, as Dr. Allen testified to this. There is\nevidence in the record. This is why we have jury trials.\nAnd what happened was this test was solely for attempting to\ndiagnose inherited enzyme defects. This is rare. Nobody\nused it. There was not a market for it.\nAs a result of the discovery, the medical\ncommunity came around and concluded that everything they\nwere doing was wrong and the new test combining the\nknowledge that it was possible to assay for homocysteine --\nand by the way, the assaying means only measuring -- total\nhomocysteine with the discovery of the correlation could be\nput together, as Diehr allows, to come up with a better\ndiagnostic test. And at the time, obviously, and this is,\nagain, in the trial testimony, no market for this. Nobody\nwanted to do it. Everybody was just delighted with the\nexisting tests. And so Dr. Allen and Dr. Stabler had to set\nup their own lab to do it.\nIt was after the medical community came around\nthat all of the lab companies became interested in doing\nthis commercially. And I go into this level of detail\nbecause I think it is in part needed to answer the point\nmade by the Solicitor General. In a world in which there\nwas no commercial use for the existing prior art because it\nwas used rarely, and a market develops solely as a result of\npeople using the test to practice the invention, I think\nit's analytically incorrect to say that we're trying to\nmonopolize the existing prior art. What has happened is\ncommercial laboratory companies like LabCorp are selling the\ntest to practice our invention. It was open to them to\nsay --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but let me just interrupt.\nThe -- as I understand it, the alleged infringers don't use\nthe same novel process that you use in your assay, in other\nwords, step 1. They do not use the step 1 in claim 13, is\nthat correct?\nMR. ESTRADA: Our -- yes and no. I think there\nis an ambiguity in the question, Justice Stevens, because it\nis true that the Abbott method --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, assume it's not Abbott.\nJust say I come up with a novel method that's not covered by\nthe patent that I can get the assay results. And say a\ndoctor says, would you test the blood under your unpatented,\nnovel method and tell me what the results are?\nMR. ESTRADA: All right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And now if I do that and then\nthe doctor looks at it and says I think you've got a vitamin B\ndeficiency, has he infringed your patent?\nMR. ESTRADA: If the test was not ordered for\nthe purpose of diagnosing --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It was ordered for the\npurpose of letting the doctor know exactly what the assay\nwould be. Yes.\nMR. ESTRADA: Well, unless --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: He hasn't --\nMR. ESTRADA: -- there was a purpose for\ndiagnosing the deficiency, I would say no. And while we're\non the subject of engaging what our arguments have been all\nalong, we made clear in our brief, and nobody ever\nresponded, at page 38, that claim 13 is only infringed when\nthe assaying and the correlating steps are both performed\nsequentially for the purpose of diagnosing vitamin B\ndeficiency.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, a doctor asked me to\nperform under my -- my own method, step 1, which I do it and\nI give him the results and then he tells the patient, I\nthink you've got a vitamin B deficiency, in that case, he\nhas infringed, if I understand your argument.\nMR. ESTRADA: If he did it for the purposes of\ntrying to determine whether you had a vitamin deficiency.\nNow, if he did it for the purpose of trying to determine, as\nin the prior art, whether you had an inherited enzyme\ncondition, that would not be infringing. And this point was\naddressed, obviously somewhat indirectly because it was\nnever raised in the court of appeals, by the Federal Circuit\nat page 9a and 10a where the Federal Circuit explained the\ncorrelating step was included as a limit for the intended\nuse of the test as a means to distinguish the intended use\nfor this test from the prior art.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're onto something, to me,\nthat is absolutely fundamental. You have millions of\ndoctors and scientists and computer people who are working\nextremely hard to think of useful ideas and if you don't\ngive them an incentive, they may think of less.\nMR. ESTRADA: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they're all useful. At\nthe same time, if you patent all of their ideas, including\nvery useful mini-micro principle ideas, you will establish\nmonopolies throughout this country beyond belief and it will\nbe difficult for people, without paying vast amounts of\nmoney, to use their useful ideas.\nSo what principle do we use to separate the\nscientific idea which can't be patented from the process\nwhich can be? I thought that the claim was settled by\nMorse, Flook and Diehr. Now would it make sense -- you can\nanswer any part of this question you want.\nMR. ESTRADA: All right. Let me --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would it make sense to send\nthis back and say, look, at least address their argument?\nYou can answer any part of that.\nMR. ESTRADA: Three answers. Number one, under\nthe patent laws, everybody -- anybody who makes, uses or\nsells the invention is potentially liable as an infringer.\nNumber two, Congress knows this and it knows that the people\nwho might be liable as infringers are doctors. It passed in\n1996 section 287(c) of the patent law that gives doctors a\ndefense to infringement for certain things they do in their\noffices, not this one. So Congress is perfectly aware of\nall of the policy issues being raised and has chosen to give\nan answer only so far.\nThe third is it is a fundamental misconception\nto treat the case as though, even if the section 101 issue\nis in front of the Court -- and it isn't -- whether the\nissue is whether section 101 means that something is\nactually patentable as opposed to what Diehr said, which is,\nis it possibly patentable. This is subject matter\npatentability. Is the mouth of the funnel, not the end of\nthe funnel, and all of the outlandish hypotheticals that we\nhave to deal about how this could be patented don't really\ndeal with the reality of the patent code, which is this is\nthe intake funnel. We have doctrines of obviousness,\nanticipation, 112, many other things, all of which were\nraised at trial and the jury rejected in this case.\nBut the reason why there may be some\nsuperficial appeal to the outlandish hypotheticals, Justice\nBreyer, is because there is an effort to confuse the issue\nthat they're trying to smuggle belatedly into the case, 101,\nas though it dealt with whether something is actually\npatentable as opposed to potentially patentable. And on the\nlatter question, whether something is potentially\npatentable, we have the extremely broad language of section\n101 coupled by this Court's cases, in Chakrabarty and Diehr,\nwhich said that what Congress intended is for anything under\nthe sun made by man to be potentially patentable. And if\nthere is some more precise policy issue why a particular\ninvention ought not to be patentable, it is found in section\n102, 103, 112, other parts of the patent code, on which they\nlost in front of the jury.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was made by man here?\nWhat was made by man here? I mean, if you're\ntalking about the type of assay that your client developed,\nwhich was involved in other claims, not in 13, then I'd\nsay, yes, that was made by man. But here, what 13 involves\nis simply discovery of the natural principle that when one,\nwhen there is the presence of one substance in a human\nbeing, there is a deficiency of two other ones. That's just\na natural principle. What's made by man about that?\nMR. ESTRADA: Well, the -- we don't contend that\nthe second step of the correlation is independently\npatentable even though the argument is framed as a --\nargument. What we contend is patentable and what's allowed\nby Diehr is the inventive spark of putting together the\ndiscovery of the correlation with a way found elsewhere to\nmeasure these important bodily chemicals to produce a\ndiagnostic test.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A way found elsewhere if\nindeed the Federal Circuit had determined the second step,\nyou know, step 1, do the assay, step 2, correlate. If the\nFederal Circuit had said, oh, that requires your using a\nscale to see how much of one there is and how little of the\nother, but this Federal Circuit says, all correlate means is\nbe aware of the fact that when one substance is high, the\nother two are going to be low. That's all it means.\nMR. ESTRADA: Well, that's unfair to the Federal\nCircuit on two points. Number one, it was very clear to the\nFederal Circuit, and in fact I think they said that, I can't\nput my hand on the page, where they said, there is no issue\nhere about step number one. All that people are fighting\nabout is the correlating step and what it means.\nAnd the problem that LabCorp had in the Federal\nCircuit with respect to the correlating step, which is a\nquestion they tried to bring up and was cert denied, is that\nthey proposed in the district court the definition that was\nused by the Federal Circuit, which is a mutual or reciprocal\nrelationship between an elevated level and the vitamin. And\nso having proposed that, it actually makes sense as a\ndiagnostic test, as the Federal Circuit pointed out with the\nexample of the pregnancy test.\nNow, Justice Scalia, you asked a question\nearlier --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, please don't get off it --\nbecause this is my biggest problem with the case. I agree\nthat what you've said is simply a statement of the natural\nphenomenon, that when the one substance is high, the other\ntwo are low. And simply to be aware of that natural\nphenomenon is all that correlation consists of.\nMR. ESTRADA: Well, it is true but is not\nnecessarily the case that being aware of a natural\nphenomenon or of a correlation leads you inevitably to an\ninventive diagnostic test. There is a correlation between\nbeing tall and being -- you know, between height and weight.\nIf I tell you that somebody's coming to visit you who is 250\npounds, that person is probably not a five year-old. But that\ngets me nowhere in terms of turning that into useful knowledge\nthat could be patentable.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you do agree, do you\nnot, that step 2 by itself would not be patentable?\nMR. ESTRADA: I do agree with that, Justice\nStevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Your point is that even\nthough step 2 is performed as the second step of step 1\nwhich is also not patentable, you get together for the\npatent?\nMR. ESTRADA: That's true. And if you look at\nthe Diehr case, it's a perfect example because Diehr had\nmore steps but it was absolutely true in Diehr that every\nsingle step, including the mathematical equation, was part\nof the prior art. And this Court said that's potentially\npatentable because you have found a way to put all these\ndisparate things together in a way that makes\nthem potentially useful.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does that fall within it?\nI mean, I can't resist pointing, as one of these briefs\ndid, the phrase anything under the sun that is made by\nman comes from a committee report that said something\ndifferent. It said a person may have invented a machine or\na manufacture, which may include anything under the sun that\nis made by man.\nSo referring to that doesn't help solve the\nproblem where we're not talking about a machine or a\nmanufacture. Rather we are talking about what has to be\ndone in order to make an abstract idea fall within the\npatent act. Now, sometimes you can make that happen by\nconnecting it with some physical things in the world and\nsometimes you can't.\nMR. ESTRADA: But Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if you have a clear\nstatement other than Diehr, Flook, Morse, which draws that\nline properly, let me know.\nMR. ESTRADA: I think the telephone cases, Bell\nand Diehr, are cases that absolutely show that under this\nCourt's cases, this is patentable subject matter. Again,\nwe're talking about the mouth of the funnel, not the end of\nthe funnel.\nBut let me point something else, Justice\nBreyer, which is it came from a committee report but it's\nalready been incorporated in this Court's cases in\nChakrabarty and in Diehr as exemplary of Congress'\ndetermination to have the mouth of the funnel be very wide.\nAnd if there are problems with something being ultimately\npatentable, they are because there is some other requirement\nof the patent law that -- that -- that should be looked at.\nOne of the other points on the question that\nJustice Scalia asked, because I think it is important on\nwhether this question is before the Court, is that the rules\nof this Court, rule 14(1)(f) mandated the petition shall\ncontain, quote, the statutes involved in the case set out\nverbatim. And you can pick up the cert petition and indeed\nthere is an appendix which is at the very last page of the\npetition, and you can look at it and it says, pertinent\nstatutory provisions. There are two statutes, section 112\nand section 271. You can pick up their blue brief and do\nthe same with the back flap, and we have the fishes and the\nloaves.\nNow they have three statutes, 101, 112 and 271.\nThere is no way to construe their question 3 as having been\nintended all along to encompass a very separate affirmative\ndefense that they never put in front of the trial court or\nthe Federal Circuit.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would the case be different\nif they quoted section 101 in their appendix?\nMR. ESTRADA: Yes, I think it would be\ndifferent, Justice Stevens, because then their argument that\nthis was encompassed within one of the questions in the\npetition might have some surface plausibility. But it\ndoesn't.\nLet me just go back and link that point with\nanother aspect of our legal system, which is you see cases\nof forfeiture and waiver all the time. This term in\nUnitherm and in Arbaugh, you have already said twice that\nparties should be held responsible for their procedural\ndefaults. You do that in other areas of the law.\nAnd the one that came to mind, to my mind as I\nwas thinking about this case, Justice Stevens, is going all\nthe way back to Wainwright versus Sykes, because you have\ncases every year involving habeas corpus, where Wainwright\nversus Sykes says we have to be careful about sandbagging,\nand we're going to presume that an indigent defendant on\ntrial for his life in a rural county someplace with a lawyer\ntwo years out of law school, who can't find the courthouse,\nconsciously chose to save the federal claims so that he\ncould assert later, have it in his back pocket: We're going\nto have a rule of forfeiture for sandbagging.\nEmpirically, one may well wonder whether that\nis empirically likely to be true in a great number of cases.\nBut we don't have to wonder in this case because every well\nadvised corporate defendant, if I am their lawyer, I will\nadvise them to hold this in the back pocket and to have a\nsecond trip to the trial court and the court of appeals\nbecause in the rules in affirmative defense, rule 8 says you\nhave to plead it and the statute says you have to prove it.\nAnd it went all the way up the ladder.\nAnd if you tell them that they get to start all\nover again, what you will have is every well advised\ncorporate defendant will be advised by counsel, like me and\nby Mr. Franklin, that the way to do is to tire the inventor\nout, have a trial and then we can start all over again. And\nthat's no way to run a legal system, especially when they're\ncoming with the most important questions of patent law to\nthis Court with incredibly far-reaching implications and the\nbest that they can say to the Court about why you shouldn't\nworry about the consequences is, as they say in the closing\npages of the reply brief, rule for us and every other case\nwill have to be considered on its own merits. Which I guess\nis true as far as it goes but it's about as helpful as\ntelling the Patent Office and the lower courts that life is\na fountain. And you know, this Court does not sit to\nissue --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You mean life isn't a\nfountain?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ESTRADA: I didn't say it wasn't. I just\nsaid that the expression of that thought is not helpful.\nAnd insofar as this Court sits to advise the lower courts\nand the government and the patents office and the investing\ncommunity who could swing billions of dollars on the basis\nof an issue that was never litigated in the lower courts, I\nfrankly submit, Justice Scalia, that it would be\nirresponsible for the Court to reach out and deal with a\nquestion for which there was never an adequate factual\npredicate.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And Wainwright against Sykes\nwas even decided before AEDPA was passed, too.\nMR. ESTRADA: Exactly. And Congress actually\nimplemented that in AEDPA. And so my basic point, Justice\nStevens, is if that the legal system takes the procedural\nregularity of our courts seriously enough to enforce them in\nwhat would seem to some people to be pretty compelling\ncircumstances of life and death, there is little claim on\nthe legal system for a well heeled corporate defendant who\nhas been adjudged to be a willful infringer by a jury to\ncome to this Court and asked to be put in the starting gate\nagain. There is no way that -- again, that is no way to\ndeal with the legal system.\nI have nothing further, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Estrada.\nMr. Franklin, I think you have about four and a\nhalf minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FRANKLIN: Hopefully I won't, I won't have\nto use all that.\nJust a few points, Your Honors. There was a\nsuggestion made that it matters what purpose these tests\nwere undertaken for. That is not true. We had argued\nextensively that it did matter, that in fact the doctors\nwere using this for not detecting vitamin deficiencies but\nfor detecting heart disease. That was not -- we were not\nsuccessful on that. What the court of appeals said was any\ndoctor on pain of malpractice will necessarily perform the\ncorrelating every time that doctor looks at a test result.\nSo it doesn't matter why the doctor does that.\nSecond, Morse was clearly a case decided under\nwhat is now section 112. I think Mr. Hungar admitted that.\nThe language of the case makes that clear. It quotes the\nrelevant statute, and all of this is in our reply brief, and\nit concludes that the patent in that case was overbroad\nbecause it didn't, it contravened what is now section 112\nand that is how we argued --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Weren't 112 and 101 combined\nat that time?\nMR. FRANKLIN: They were.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you disagree with that?\nMR. FRANKLIN: No, I don't. He is correct on\nthat. But look at the case and how it was decided. It was\ndecided on the basis of what is now section 112. We have\ncited numerous cases in the lower courts that have\ninterpreted it that way. And I believe Mr. Hungar admitted\nthat too.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I don't want to take up your\ntime on rebuttal but I have to ask you, do you have an\nexplanation for not quoting section 101 in your papers?\nMR. FRANKLIN: I think the explanation is that\nwe cited all of the cases -- for example, Mackay Radio is a\ncase we cited that doesn't itself cite 101. The Court\nitself never cited 101 in these cases until 1972. It was a\njudicially created exception for laws of nature and natural\nphenomena. And of course to the extent it is applicable\nhere, it is applicable either on its own, but also in\nconnection with and as a natural predicate to the 112\ninquiry. And there I think the analogy to Morse is quite\nstriking. And what -- in Morse, the Court said that he\ncould not monopolize all devices and processes used to\ntransmit the characters at a distance through the natural\nphenomenon of electromagnetism.\nHere what these patentees are seeking to do\nis to monopolize all homocysteine tests that are used to, as\nthey say, detect vitamin deficiencies through the natural\ncorrelation that they recite. Morse couldn't do that\nbecause it wasn't limited to the one device that he actually\ninvented. Here they cannot do it because it's not limited\nto the one homocysteine assay that they in fact invented,\nthat we use and that we pay royalties on every time we use.\nFinally, I think that the primary gatekeepers\nhere on these kinds of things is the Patent & Trademark\nOffice. I think they're trying their best, but what I heard\nfrom their representative today is that they're not prepared\nto do anything about these kinds of patents unless this\nCourt gives them further guidance. We are only asking that\nthe Court give them further guidance on this patent and to\nsay that a patent that claims nothing more than a natural\ncorrelation preceded by the inherent and generic step of\nmeasuring the input for that correlation is invalid and the\njudgment that is based upon it should also be reversed.\nThank you, Your Honors.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you. The case is\nsubmitted.\n(Whereupon, at 12:11 p.m., the case in the\nabove-titled matter was submitted.)\n"
