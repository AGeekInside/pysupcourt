        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Number 02-524, Janette Price, Warden\nversus Duyonn Andre Vincent.\nMr. Busch.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR A. BUSCH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BUSCH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThis case involves a gang-related murder in\nwhich a jury found the defendant guilty beyond a\nreasonable doubt. There was one trial conducted, and the\ndefendant was sentenced to life in prison.\nThe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals erred in its\nconclusion that the Michigan Supreme Court's decision on\ndouble jeopardy was unreasonable. The AEDPA precludes\nhabeas corpus relief where a State court makes reasonable\nfactual determinations. The Michigan Supreme Court's\ndecision was not only reasonable, but also correct.\nThe Michigan Supreme Court's decision was\ncorrect for three reasons.\nFirst, this was a factual matter which was\nreasonably decided.\nSecond, the trial judge's --\nQUESTION: When you -- when you say this was a\nfactual matter, I got the impression that as to basic\nfacts, there really wasn't any dispute about them.\nMR. BUSCH: Mr. Chief Justice, the Michigan\nSupreme Court was evaluating what exactly this trial judge\nsaid. It was ambiguous. And in trying to determine what\nhe said, then we could understand, or they could\nunderstand what he had done and what legal import that\nhad.\nQUESTION: But -- but there was no -- all I'm\nsaying, there was no doubt about what -- what he said.\nThe -- the legal import is -- may be much more difficult\nto figure out.\nMR. BUSCH: Your Honor, the factual question in\nterms of what it was that he said is -- is different than\nwhat he had actually done. And therein lying --\nunderstanding what this judge had done or said, the\nmeaning of it, then would give us some understanding of\nwhat the legal import was.\nQUESTION: Well, I guess there are really three\nquestions, aren't there? One is what he said, and\nthere -- as the Chief Justice says, there's no dispute on\nwhat he said. The second question is what he meant by\nwhat he said. And the third question is, once you know\nwhat he meant, at law does that constitute a -- a final\njudgment.\nMR. BUSCH: Yes, that's correct.\nQUESTION: So there are three questions, and --\nand which one -- is the middle one, what he meant, as\nopposed to what he said -- is that a factual or a -- or a\nlegal one?\nMR. BUSCH: That -- it would be our position\nthat it is a factual question and courts -- the Court in\nParker versus Dugger and Wainwright versus Goode have\ndealt with this issue. Where we have ambiguous rulings of\na trial judge, that has been found to be a factual --\nQUESTION: I'm not sure actually -- your\ninference. I mean, it's quite a fine point, but I guess I\nwouldn't say necessarily that what he meant has anything\nto do with it.\nworld, and if he had a secret meaning, we don't care nor\ndoes the law. But having said these particular things in\nthe world, then the question would be, can the Michigan\nSupreme Court -- does it -- did it -- it characterized\nthose things, and it said as a matter of Michigan law,\nthose things said in the world do not amount to a judgment\nof acquittal.\nSo then I guess we would -- if that's the way to\nlook at it, then we would have the problem of deciding\nwhether, even though as a matter of Michigan law, those\nevents that took place in the world do not amount to a\njudgment of acquittal. Nonetheless, for purposes of the\nFederal Double Jeopardy Clause, do they amount to a\njudgment of acquittal?\nThose would be two legal questions. One, a\nState law question, and one, a Federal question, and no\nfactual question.\nMR. BUSCH: Well --\nQUESTION: But that's something of a quibble\nbecause I don't know that leads us to a different place.\nMR. BUSCH: The Michigan court found that this\ntrial judge's decision was, in fact, tentative. And that\ndecision and conclusion was reasonable. The judge, at\npage 12 of the joint exhibit, speaks of -- and if I could\nturn to that page.\nmy impression is at this time --\nQUESTION: What page?\nMR. BUSCH: Page 12 of the --\nQUESTION: Page 12 of what?\nMR. BUSCH: At the bottom of page 12 of the\njoint -- the joint appendix. Excuse me.\nThe court says, nothing? Well, my impression at\nthis time is that there's not been shown. And then at\npage 18 of the same exhibit, the court actually schedules\nan 8:30 motion the following day when the prosecutor in\nthis case -- the assistant prosecutor asked the court if\nhe could be heard. And the judge said, I'll be glad to\nhear you. And in fact, the court had originally scheduled\nthe attorneys to be there at 10:00 and then changed the\ntime for them to show up before the jury came back.\nAnd lastly I think it shows that no one who was\ninvolved in this case at the trial level actually believed\nthat a final ruling had been made. The court says at\npage 34 -- excuse me. The defense counsel says -- and I'm\nquoting Mr. Odette -- that's correct. They don't -- I'm\nnot disputing that, but it's my firm impression that when\nI left the court yesterday, that there had been a ruling\nand that Mr. Stamos had indicated he'd like to have the\nmatter reconsidered. And I believe the court said,\nwhatever.\nAnd what's instructive is what the judge said\nnext. That's right. And I -- well, I said, yes, I'd be\nglad to listen, or words to that effect.\nLastly --\nQUESTION: What about the docket entry? Was\nthere a docket entry too?\nMR. BUSCH: There was a docket entry which was\nmade by a clerk which was not reviewed by -- and which is\nnot reviewed by the trial judge. And in Michigan, the\ndocket entry isn't dispositive of whether or not the judge\nhad made a final ruling of acquittal or a judgment of\nacquittal.\nQUESTION: May I -- may I just ask you a further\nquestion to make sure that I understand the -- the sort of\nthe assumption behind your argument? And it's really the\nsame question that Justice Breyer and Justice Scalia I\nthink were -- were raising.\nMy understanding is that the courts, up to this\npoint, have treated the issue here as an issue of fact.\nWhat was the judge -- what did the judge think he was\ndoing? Did he understand or could one reasonably\nunderstand that the had made a final ruling or not?\nIt might also have been treated as an issue of\nlaw. Given what the judge did, even if he thought he had\nmade a final ruling, he might, as a matter of law,\nconsistent with the Double Jeopardy Clause, have been able\nto change his mind if he hadn't issued a formal order and\nif no one had acted in reliance.\nBut I understand that legal question, the way I\njust put it, is not the question that people understood\nhas been decided in this case, and that everybody is\ntreating this as a -- as an issue of the factual question\nand that's what you're addressing. Am I correct?\nMR. BUSCH: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. BUSCH: The Court has also -- and without\nconceding my case, in the alternative, if this Court was\nto conclude that this judge had, in fact, issued or made a\njudgment of acquittal, it would be the people's position\nor the petitioner's position that the trial court need not\nbe able to reconsider to reach a just result because\nthey -- they rule so swiftly. In other words, the\nMichigan court was correct because judges, trial judges in\nparticular, need time to reflect. They're often making\nthese decisions without trial transcripts, in many cases\nwithout extensive legal research.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Busch, this case here\ncome -- the case comes to us under -- under AEDPA; that\nis, that you don't have to show that the Michigan Supreme\nCourt was correct as a matter of law in its decision. You\nhave -- your -- your opponent has to show that either it\nwas an unreasonable application of our precedents or\ncontrary to our precedents, if it's a legal question, and\nif it's a factual question, that the Michigan Supreme\nCourt made unreasonable findings of fact.\nMR. BUSCH: Exactly. And also, this Court has\nheld and the statute requires that that finding of fact be\npresumed to be correct.\nQUESTION: Mr. Busch, why wouldn't it be\nunreasonable if, as respondent asserts, the Michigan rules\nprovide that a directed verdict made at the close of the\nevidence, that the judge may not reserve decision, must\ndecide it, may not reserve decision. I think that's what\nthe judge ended up doing here, is that not so? When he\nreconsidered, he reserved decision 'til the end of the\ndefense case.\nMR. BUSCH: Yes, and in fact, in this particular\ncase, the judge did not come to a conclusion as to -- did\nnot enter a verdict of acquittal. In this particular\nmatter, the court held -- in that particular circumstance,\nit said in the opinion that it was harmless error in their\nopinion. However --\nQUESTION: They -- did they address -- I didn't\nnotice that the court had addressed the Michigan rule that\nsaid --\nMR. BUSCH: They --\nQUESTION: -- you can't reserve decision.\nMR. BUSCH: The rule of the Michigan courts --\nthat is, the Michigan Rules of Criminal Procedure at\n6.419, I believe it is -- requires that there be some\nplain statement made, essentially, that there be something\nclear. And that was -- and it is -- our position that the\ncourt --\nQUESTION: I don't understand what you mean.\nAre you addressing Justice Ginsburg's question? She's\ntalking about the rule that says you can't reserve --\nMR. BUSCH: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- when a motion is made at the close\nof all -- was this motion made at the close of all the\nevidence?\nMR. BUSCH: At the close of the prosecutor's\nproof.\nQUESTION: Is that what the rule applies to? At\nthe close of the prosecutor's proof? Or does it apply to\nonly when the whole trial has been completed?\nMR. BUSCH: It -- it applies when the motion is\nmade is my understanding.\nQUESTION: I don't understand that.\nQUESTION: Well, that's not really an answer.\nIf it's just the prosecutor's case and the motion is made,\nis that covered by the rule, or is it required that both\nthe prosecutor and the defense case be in?\nMR. BUSCH: No. It can be made at any time\nand -- and any point in --\nQUESTION: A motion can be made, but --\nMR. BUSCH: That is, the motion for a directed\nverdict of acquittal.\nQUESTION: Do you have the rule, the rule of\ncriminal procedure, so we'll know -- that might give us\nthe answer to this question.\nMR. BUSCH: The --\nQUESTION: The Michigan rule that says the trial\njudge shall not reserve decision on the defendant's\nmotion. Does that rule apply when the motion is made at\nthe close of the prosecutor's case?\nMR. BUSCH: The rule is 6.419(D), and it's cited\nat page 17 of the petitioner's brief.\nQUESTION: Is it quoted there too?\nQUESTION: What does it say?\nMR. BUSCH: It says -- about in the middle of\nthe page in -- in bold, it says, did not substantially\ncomply with the requirements of MCR 6.419(D), and provide\nthat, quote, the court must state orally on the record or\nin a written ruling made a -- a part of the record its\nreasons for granting or denying a motion for a directed\nverdict of acquittal. And my understanding of that is --\nthat rule is that anytime the motion is made, the judge is\nsupposed to make clear the reasons why he's granting a\ndirected verdict.\nQUESTION: Well --\nQUESTION: What is --\nQUESTION: But in ordinary trial practice\ncertainly you -- you can't -- the defense counsel in a\ncriminal case can't get up after the prosecution has\ncalled two witnesses and said, I move for -- I -- I move\nfor a judgment of acquittal. I would think the first time\nthat could be made ordinarily would be --\nMR. BUSCH: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- after the close of the\nprosecution's case.\nMR. BUSCH: That's correct, once the evidence is\npresented.\nQUESTION: And what has the rule, as you just\nquoted it, got to do with -- with reservation? In other\nwords, the judge can say, my reasons are A, B, and C, but\nI'm going to sleep on it, and -- and tomorrow morning I\nmay come up with D and -- and rule the other way. I mean,\nwhat's that -- what's it got to do with reservation,\nhis -- his reserving his right to change the ruling at a\nlater time?\nMR. BUSCH: The rights of the judge to change\nhis mind -- our -- our position is, is that he has that\nright until the jury would be discharged.\nQUESTION: Well, does the rule address that? I\nmean, Justice Ginsburg asked a question going to\nreasonableness that depended on what she understood from\nthe -- from the briefs to be a Michigan rule saying the\njudge can't reserve his right to change his mind later or\nreserve judgment on the motion when it's made.\nQUESTION: In respondent's brief, it's put in\nquotes. And it sounds like it's quoting from a rule,\n6.419(A). Quote: The court may not reserve decision on\nthe defendant's motion.\nMR. BUSCH: Yes, that --\nQUESTION: Do those words appear in the rule?\nMR. BUSCH: Yes, that's the rule.\nQUESTION: That's fine. And what motion does it\nrefer to? A motion made at what point? At any point at\nall?\nMR. BUSCH: That's my -- I don't think it's\nspecific, but I think the --\nQUESTION: Wow.\nMR. BUSCH: -- Chief Justice --\nQUESTION: So after two witnesses are called by\nthe prosecution, the motion can be made and the judge\ncannot reserve?\nMR. BUSCH: Excuse me. At the close of the\nprosecutor's proofs, that motion would be appropriate\nunder our rules of criminal procedure.\nQUESTION: Do -- do we have the full text of\nthis rule before us?\nMR. BUSCH: The rule is quoted at page 29a,\nnote 1 of the --\nQUESTION: 29 of the --\nQUESTION: Of what?\nMR. BUSCH: Of our brief.\nQUESTION: 29?\nMR. BUSCH: Excuse me. Of the joint appendix.\nPetition's appendix --\nQUESTION: 29.\nMR. BUSCH: -- petitioner's appendix.\nQUESTION: Petitioner's appendix?\nQUESTION: The cert petition.\nQUESTION: In the cert petition.\nQUESTION: Yes, and footnoted.\nQUESTION: Yes. It -- it says after the\nprosecution's case has rested.\nMR. BUSCH: Yes, that's right.\nQUESTION: It's a little hard to understand\nthat. Anyway, they said it was harmless error. The --\nthe court -- the courts -- the Michigan court said it's\nharmless error, all right. But it's a little hard to\nunderstand.\nIt says you -- you -- the prosecution finishes\nthe case. The defendant then says, judge, I move for a\ndirected verdict. All right? Or a failure of proof,\nwhatever the words are. Then it says the judge could give\nhis reasons in writing -- I mean, that's one way -- or\norally. How is the judge supposed to do this without\ntaking some time? What does reserve there mean? Does it\nmean he has to pass on it before they present the --\nthe -- he has to decide it before the defense presents its\ncase? Does it mean you can't reserve it 'til after the\ndefense has presented the case? Does it mean you have to\nrule instantly? What does it mean?\nMR. BUSCH: Your Honor, I --\nQUESTION: It can't mean instantly. What?\nMR. BUSCH: The -- the rule means that he should\ndecide as promptly as he can is the way I understand --\nQUESTION: Now, Mr. Busch, may I make this\nsuggestion? It seems to me the rule distinguishes between\nmotions made after the prosecution has rested and motions\nmade after the entire case is in.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION:\ncan reserve, take his time on it.\nMR. BUSCH: Yes.\nQUESTION: It seems to -- it strikes me, just\nreading the thing, that the point of the rule is that\nbefore the defense goes forward, the defense has a right\nto know what the ruling is.\nQUESTION: That's what I would think.\nQUESTION: Now, in this case before the defense\nwent forward, it knew what the ruling was because the\njudge had come in the next morning and said, okay, I --\nyou know, I've -- I'm going to listen to you again. I've\nlistened to you again, and -- and, in point of fact,\nI'm -- I'm not going to grant the motion. And isn't that\nenough to satisfy what seems to be the point of the rule,\nand that is, before a defendant goes forward with a case,\nhe's got to know whether he has to or not? Isn't --\ndon't -- isn't that a fair way of reading this thing?\nMR. BUSCH: Yes, and I think that happened in\nthis case. This defendant came prepared to try the case\non a first degree murder theory, and nothing substantially\nchanged that and he was not prejudiced in any way.\nQUESTION: No. But before he -- before he went\nforward with his evidence, the judge had changed his mind\nor come to a further, more final conclusion, however you\nwant to characterize it, so that before he went forward,\nhe knew the judge was saying, no, I'm not throwing out the\nfirst degree murder charge. And isn't that enough under\nthe rule?\nMR. BUSCH: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: But you would say that if the --\nMR. BUSCH: May -- can -- can I --\nQUESTION: -- if the defendant was operating\nunder the impression that the -- if the defendant didn't\nknow before he put on his case, would it be too late for\nthe judge to change his mind at the end of the defense\ncase?\nMR. BUSCH: Our -- no. Our position would be\nthat he can change his mind anytime up until that jury is\ndischarged.\nChief -- Mr. Chief Justice, may I reserve the\nbalance of my time for rebuttal?\nQUESTION: Yes, you may, Mr. Busch.\nWe'll hear from Mr. Lamken.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. LAMKEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIt's a long-established background principle\nthat mid-trial rulings are inherently subject to\nreconsideration by the trial court itself until the end of\ntrial. That is especially so where, as here, a party\npromptly seeks reconsideration which necessarily renders\nthe initial ruling inconclusive. That rule reflects four\nimportant legal and practical considerations.\nFirst, trial courts often must rule swiftly\nwithout the benefit of extended briefing, argument, or\ndeliberation or even a copy of the trial transcript. They\ncould not operate justly absent the opportunity for\nreconsideration.\nSecond, the Double Jeopardy Clause affords the\ngovernment a full and fair opportunity to make its case in\nthe first tribunal. In the context of trial, that full\nand fair opportunity includes reconsideration. Indeed,\nreconsideration is particularly important precisely\nbecause the government very often cannot appeal.\nQUESTION: I guess we never reach your -- your\nargument, do we, if we decide this on the 2254 ground.\nMR. LAMKEN: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\nThe Court could -- there are many stopping points short of\nour argument on which the Court could resolve this --\nQUESTION: Well, we shouldn't reach your ground\nunless we have to, should we? Because your ground is a\nconstitutional ground.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, Your Honor, the Court would\nhave discretion to reach the constitutional ground if it\nthought it were important enough to resolve the\ndisagreements in the State courts and their -- their\nrulings that are contrary to --\nQUESTION: I thought we try to avoid deciding\nconstitutional questions.\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes. That is -- that is one of the\nrules the Court follows and it's a general rule, but in\nimportant cases, particularly in the qualified immunity\ncontext, for example, the Court will -- will sometimes\nannounce the constitutional rule because it's sufficiently\nimportant to settle the matter rather than resolving it on\nstatutory grounds or in -- in the context of qualified\nimmunity on reasonableness grounds.\nQUESTION: Well, that's sort of a special\nsituation because in those situations you could never get\nthe answer if you always decided it on -- on immunity\ngrounds. I mean --\nMR. LAMKEN: Justice Scalia, the Court would\nhave discretion to reach the constitutional issue if it\nchose, but it would -- certainly would not be required to\ndo so. For example, the Court decided a double jeopardy\nissue in Monge, but that was 4 years after addressing the\nexact same issue in -- on Teague grounds in an earlier\ncase. And for those 4 years, the lower Federal courts and\nthe courts in the State of California for which it had\nspecial applicability suffered through a -- a tremendous\namount of uncertainty.\nAnd we would urge the Court, given the\nuncertainty that's out there, to reach the constitutional\nquestion. However, the Court would have discretion to\nresolve this on 2254 grounds --\nQUESTION: If we follow the position that you're\nurging and -- and the judge rules, as here, premeditation\nis out of the case, I'm not going to charge first degree,\ndefendant puts on defendant's case on the assumption first\ndegree is out of the case and then the judge says at the\nend, oh, sorry, I'm reversing and I'm going to charge.\nNow, you say the judge can change his mind at any time\n'til the end of the line. It seems to me that would be\ngrossly unfair to a defendant.\nMR. LAMKEN: For double jeopardy purposes, but\nnot for due process purposes. That would raise a -- raise\na -- a serious due -- excuse me -- due process issue.\nIt's the exact same issue that arises, for example, when a\ntrial court dismisses a count of a complaint, which raises\nno double jeopardy concerns at all and then, very late in\nthe trial, determines that he had erred in dismissing\nan -- a count of the indictment.\nordinary process is either the court must reopen the\nevidence to permit the defendant to put on the defense\nthat he didn't have the opportunity to present, or the\ndefendant may be entitled to a mistrial. But that is very\nmuch a fairness trial, due process issue, not a question\nof double jeopardy.\nThe third point is that double jeopardy --\nQUESTION: So then in Fong Foo when Judge\nWyzanski I think got angry at the prosecution for some\nreason that escaped the Court and everyone else, directs\nan acquittal, what the prosecutor should have done is just\ngo back to Judge Wyzanski and say, Judge, you made a\nmistake here. I haven't been talking to the witness in\nthe hall as you thought, or whatever, and then Judge\nWyzanski could have, in fact, taken back the -- the\njudgment of the directed -- directed verdict of acquittal,\nalthough this Court later wouldn't have been able to do it\nin your view.\nMR. LAMKEN: In our view that's precisely\ncorrect, so long as Judge Wyzanski had not discharged the\njury because once you discharge the jury, the -- the\ndefendant's right to trial before his tribunal of choice\nhas been eliminated. The -- so long as the jury hasn't\nbeen discharged, the trial court has inherent authority to\ncorrect its own mistakes.\nserved by giving -- by precluding reconsideration to give\nthe defendant the benefit of acquittal to which no court,\nand certainly not the jury and not the trial court that\nputatively granted it, believes the defendant is entitled.\nParticularly --\nQUESTION: What's your best authority for that\nproposition from this Court?\nMR. LAMKEN: The --\nQUESTION: Or -- or --\nMR. LAMKEN: I'd say --\nQUESTION: Or does that take us somewhat further\nthan we've gone?\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, I think it would -- our best\ncase would probably be this Court's statements in Arizona\nversus Washington, in essence that the government --\nalthough the government often doesn't get an appeal and it\ndoesn't get a second shot at -- bite of the apple, it does\nget one full and fair opportunity before the trial court.\nIn our view that full and fair opportunity must include\nreconsideration precisely because trial courts move so\nswiftly and because the initial decision by a trial court\nisn't meant to be a final decision but is, in fact, part\nof the deliberative process, part of the ongoing dialogue\nin trial among the judge, among a prosecutor and\ndefendant's counsel.\nQUESTION: So if you drop the first degree\nmurder charge -- or the judge orders it dismissed and then\nthe defendant testifies thinking, well, at least I'm not\ngoing to be tried for first degree, in your view the trial\njudge can change its ruling and reinstate the first degree\nmurder charges because the defendant shouldn't have\nrelied? He --\nMR. LAMKEN: No. We think it's --\nQUESTION: The -- the defendant should know that\nthe judge can change his mind, and so he better not take\nthe stand.\nMR. LAMKEN: No. The ordinary rule -- and this\nis the same rule that applies where a court, for example,\ndismisses a count of the indictment -- is that defendants\nare entitled to rely on the interlocutory rulings. If\nthey do so to their detriment and to their prejudice and\nit denies them the opportunity to present their fair\ndefense, that is a significant due process problem and may\nentitle --\nQUESTION: What --\nQUESTION: Well, it wouldn't be if -- excuse me.\nQUESTION: What -- what if you have a series of\ndefendants in a -- in a case and it's being tried, and at\nthe close of the prosecution's evidence, the judge\ndismisses the indictment as against one of the defendants,\nbut keeps on so the jury is still there? What happens\nthen? Can the -- the prosecution come back a couple days\nlater and say, you made a mistake?\nMR. LAMKEN: That's, actually points up a\ndifficult question which is whether or not the dismissal\nof the -- well, if it's dismissal in the indictment, it\ncertainly isn't a double jeopardy problem, but if it's a\njudgment of acquittal at that point, the question the\ncourt would have to confront --\nQUESTION: Well, say -- change my hypothetical\nto a judgment of acquittal.\nMR. LAMKEN: Right. That's what I assumed you\nhad meant. And if that were the case, the court would\nhave to decide whether or not that there -- there's\nconstructively or through legal fiction the discharge of\nthe jury with respect to that defendant even though the\nactual jury is still there\nQUESTION: But that's --\nMR. LAMKEN: We believe the actual answer would\nbe --\nQUESTION: That's an extraordinary doctrine.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, I -- I would believe that the\nproper answer would be that if the jury is still\navailable, the prosecution can seek reconsideration. But\none could say that the jury was constructively discharged\nwith respect to that defendant and thereby preclude the\nprosecution from seeking reconsideration. But the\ncritical moment in all of those cases is what constitutes\ndischarge of the jury, the defendant's chosen trier of\nfact.\nQUESTION: But getting back to the earlier\npoint, if a -- if the defendant testifies, thinking\nthere's going to be no first degree charge, and it's later\nreinstated, under your position I think you would say, he\nshouldn't have relied. The rule is that he knows the\njudge can change his mind. Therefore, his reliance was at\nhis peril.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, the Constitution --\nQUESTION: I mean, I don't know why you don't\nargue -- that's the consequence of your argument it seems.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, certainly the Constitution\ndoesn't require there to be mid-trial rulings on judgments\nfor acquittal. In fact, Federal Rule of Criminal\nProcedure 29(b) specifically allows --\nQUESTION: No, but the hypothetical is there is\none.\nMR. LAMKEN: Right. And if the defendant relies\nto his detriment and it prevents him from presenting a\nfair defense to which due process entitles him, we believe\nthat he might be entitled to a mistrial.\nBut we -- nothing of that sort happened here\nbecause defendant not only was on notice that this -- that\nthe ruling was subject to change, but if you look at the\npoint in the joint appendix, which is the penultimate\npage, where the court announced -- page 46, where the\ncourt announces that it has decided to reconsider, there's\nno objection from the defense saying, wait a minute, we\nrelied. Our whole defense rested on this ruling. There's\nno statement to that effect.\nQUESTION: I suppose parties can -- can\nrepudiate a contract, can't they, since there's no -- no\ninvoluntary servitude? But the mere fact that one party\nto a contract knows that the other party can repudiate it,\ndoes not mean that the repudiation can be cost-free.\nMR. LAMKEN: That -- that --\nQUESTION: The other party is entitled to rely\nupon the contract despite his knowledge that it can be\nrepudiated.\nMR. LAMKEN: Right. I -- I think that just\npoints out the general rule, that -- when a trial court\nissues a mid-trial ruling, the defendant generally has a\nright to -- to rely on it, and if he relies on it and it\ndenies him his opportunity to present a fair defense, that\npresents a serious due process problem. But it is not a\ndouble jeopardy problem because double jeopardy is\nconcerned with having two trials against the defendant\nwhen the prosecution had its full and fair opportunity in\nthe first.\nThe final problem with the contrary rule is that\nit requires appellate courts to engage in an often\nunrealistic endeavor to go through and try and determine\nwhat the trial court, through its spontaneous and\nsometimes extemporaneous statements, really meant to do or\nwhat it actually did. For example, in this case it seems\nto come down to the question of whether the words, my\nimpression at this time, is -- suggest sufficient\ntentativeness and whether the word okay is the functional\nequivalent of it is so ordered.\nIn addition, under respondent's approach, the\ntrial -- the court of appeals would be required to\ndetermine whether the request for reconsideration came\npromptly enough, whether or not it came in the same\nbreath -- I see I'm out of time.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Lamken.\nMr. Moran, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nFirst of all, a brief factual correction. The\nchange in the judge's ruling did not occur before\nMr. Vincent testified. The change in the judge's ruling\noccurred on April 2nd, 1992, 2 days after the ruling had\nbeen made after Mr. Vincent had testified. What happened\non April 1st, 1992 was the judge indicated that he would\nreconsider his motion and hold it in abeyance, but he did\nnot, at that time, take back the directed verdict of\nacquittal.\nQUESTION: Well, he didn't take it back, but he\nmade it clear that he -- he did not consider it -- he did\nnot consider that he had made a final ruling. At least\nthat was clear. It was clear that no final ruling had\nbeen made before the testimony occurred.\nMR. MORAN: He -- he took the position, Justice\nScalia, that he could take back his ruling because he had\nnot informed the jury of it.\nQUESTION: Right. Right.\nMR. MORAN: A position that we submit is wrong\nunder this Court's precedent in Sanabria.\nQUESTION: Can I -- can I ask you, do you\nbelieve like Justice Breyer that a judge can enter a final\norder without meaning to enter a final order?\nMR. MORAN: What a reviewing court has to do\nunder this precedent in Martin Linen, Justice Scalia, is\nlook at the words and actions of the trial court and\ndecide whether or not it amounts to a ruling.\nNow, in this case --\nQUESTION: And -- and you do that just\nobjectively, and even if there's plenty of evidence that\nthe judge didn't intend it to be a final ruling, if he\nused certain magic words, it's a final -- it's a final\nruling.\nMR. MORAN: Well, actually, Justice Scalia, it's\npetitioner who's arguing for a magic words approach, or\nthe Michigan Supreme Court at least.\nQUESTION: No. I -- I don't know who -- who --\nin whose favor it breaks. I'm just asking what your\nposition on it is, whether -- whether -- because on\nthat -- on that question hinges whether we are dealing\nhere with a question of fact, as we would be in\ninterpreting -- in -- in deciding, you know, what he\nintended, or a question of law, as we would be in\ninterpreting the words of a contract where indeed it\ndoesn't matter what the parties intended. If they express\nthemselves this way, you -- you take the objective meaning\nof it. Right? And that's a question of law for the court\nand not a question of fact for the jury.\nMR. MORAN: Well, Justice Scalia, our position\nis, is that the trial judge's intent is a relevant fact,\nbut whether or not what he did amounted to an acquittal --\nQUESTION: Is a question of law.\nMR. MORAN: -- is a question of law.\nQUESTION: Well, in -- in your position here\nattacking a State judgment, you don't -- you don't\nimmediately get to the constitutional question. You get\nto the question of whether the Michigan Supreme Court's\nruling was either contrary to our precedents or an\nunreasonable application of them. In other words, the\nMichigan Supreme Court could have been wrong as a matter\nof abstract constitutional law and it could still be\nupheld here.\nMR. MORAN: Yes. What we attacked in Federal\ndistrict court on habeas was the Michigan Supreme Court's\nconclusion that there had never been an acquittal at all,\nand we persuaded the Federal district judge and the Sixth\nCircuit that the Michigan Supreme Court's conclusion that\nthere had not been an acquittal was an unreasonable\napplication of this Court's precedents, particularly Ball,\nKepner, Green, because the Michigan Supreme Court placed\nprimary emphasis on the absence of formal trappings, and\nthis Court has repeatedly held that even in the absence of\nany written judgment at all, as in Ball and Kepner, that a\nfinal directed -- a verdict of acquittal is final.\nQUESTION:\nknows Michigan law, and if they want to say, under the law\nof Michigan, the events that took place here do not amount\nto an acquittal, I guess that's their right. Now, is\nthere anything in the cases that you cite which says that\nFederal law requires Michigan to count these things as an\nacquittal?\nMR. MORAN: Well, this Court's precedents,\nparticularly Martin Linen, teach that what the reviewing\ncourt is supposed to do is look not to the form of the\ntrial court's ruling but the substance.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, it happens in\nMichigan they don't do that. In Michigan, they have the\nMichigan system. Now, what is it that tells Michigan you\nhave to, as a matter of Federal law, count this as an\nacquittal? I quite agree with you that there are cases\nwhere the Court has said this is an acquittal, but I don't\nthink they're faced in those cases with a State court that\nsays the contrary.\nMR. MORAN: Well, Smalis, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. MORAN: Smalis came from a State court.\nQUESTION: Yes, but in Smalis there was no doubt\nabout what the judge had done. I mean, there he expressly\nfound that the State had not proved its case and everybody\nagreed he had done that, and then the State appealed to\nthe higher courts in Pennsylvania.\nMR. MORAN: That's right.\nIn this case, however, if you look at the full\nrecord, the trial judge himself -- and if we get to the\nissue of intent, Justice Scalia -- the trial judge himself\nsays over and over, I made a ruling, I came to a\nconclusion, I made a decision, and even at one point, I\ngranted a motion for a directed verdict. He took the\nposition simply as a matter of law, double jeopardy law,\nFederal double jeopardy law.\nQUESTION: Well, under AEDPA, what is it you\nthink that the Michigan Supreme Court did wrong? Was it\nto misapply our law, or was it a misapplication of the\nfinding of fact?\nMR. MORAN: It was a -- it was its legal\nconclusion --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. MORAN: -- that there had been no --\nQUESTION: -- but AEDPA doesn't say one way or\nthe other. AEDPA doesn't use the term, legal conclusion.\nMR. MORAN: No. But it --\nQUESTION: So what is your answer to my\nquestion?\nMR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, it matters for\nAEDPA whether it's law or fact because then we're under\n(d)(1) or (d)(2).\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. MORAN: And so --\nQUESTION: I'm asking you which one you -- you\nwant to be under, or perhaps you want to be under both.\nMR. MORAN: Well, it is our position that we win\nunder either because even if it's a finding of fact, it's\nso unreasonable to say that there was no directed verdict\nof acquittal here, that we should prevail. But --\nQUESTION: Anyway, the Michigan Supreme Court\ndidn't find the fact against you, did it? It just -- I --\nas I understand it, it said it really doesn't -- didn't\nmatter to the Michigan Supreme Court.\nMR. MORAN: That's right.\nQUESTION: It said even if he had made a ruling,\nunless -- unless the jury had been advised, it was\nineffective for double jeopardy purposes.\nMR. MORAN: Oh, that's not quite right, Justice\nScalia. What -- what the Michigan Supreme Court ruled or\nstated was they agreed with the Michigan Court of Appeals\nand the dissenters in the Michigan Supreme Court that\ncharacterizing the trial judge's comments as an acquittal\nwould require us to reverse Mr. Vincent's conviction. The\nMichigan Supreme Court actually said that. So they -- and\nthat was after a discussion of Smalis.\nBoth the Michigan Court of appeals and the\nMichigan Supreme Court, after reviewing this Court's\ndecision in Smalis, like so many other lower courts, have\ncome to the conclusion that what a trial judge may not do,\nconsistent with the Double Jeopardy Clause, is revisit a\ndirected verdict at any point later in the trial.\nQUESTION: All right. Suppose that what he says\nis, I direct the verdict. There are two defendants, Smith\nand Brown, and the judge says, I direct a verdict in favor\nof Smith. Oh, my goodness. I said the wrong thing.\nBrown. Okay? That's what happens. Are you saying the\nConstitution then just means that Smith is home free?\nCan't try him.\nMR. MORAN: Not at all, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: Because? And the difference between\nthat and this is what? 12 hours?\nMR. MORAN: No. The difference between that and\nthis is that the ruling is not final. Here the ruling was\nunquestionably final. The judge --\nQUESTION: How? Why?\nMR. MORAN: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: Why, how? Explain that.\nMR. MORAN: Because the judge announced his\nruling. All the parties, including the judge, understood\nthat under Michigan court rules, the judge could not\nreserve his decision, had to make it. He did so. He\nannounced his decision. He said, okay. Is there anything\nelse?\nQUESTION: Reserve means, I take it, that you\nhave to make a decision prior to the -- the defendant\nputting on witnesses.\nMR. MORAN: It -- the -- the court rule doesn't\nsay that. The court rule says --\nQUESTION: When I read the court rule and then\nread the Federal rule, the difference in the practice is\nwhat they mean by reserve under the Federal rule where you\ncan reserve -- and it happens every day -- is a district\njudge says, you move at the end of the plaintiff's case.\nI'm the district judge. I say I'm going to let it go to\nthe jury. If the jury acquits, you're home free. If it\nconvicts, I'll go back to it. That happens all the time.\nAnd that, it seems to me, is what the Michigan rule says\ncan't happen in Michigan --\nQUESTION: Well --\nQUESTION: Is that -- am I right?\nMR. MORAN: The Michigan rule -- I -- I don't --\nfrankly, I don't know because the Michigan rule simply\nsays the judge may not reserve his decision.\nQUESTION: But surely it can't mean that if a --\nif a motion is made at quarter after 4:00 in the afternoon\nand the court customarily recesses at 4:30, that he can't\nwait until the next morning, so no testimony being taken\nin the meantime.\nMR. MORAN: In -- in that case that would --\nthat might well be all right because he hasn't made a\nfinal decision. The problem here -- we're not --\nQUESTION: Suppose in that case the -- the\narguments by the attorneys end at 4 o'clock. The judge\nsays, well, I'll let you know my order. He enters the --\nhe tells his clerk at 4:30, enter the order dismissing the\nfirst degree charge. He then comes back at 8:30 in the\nmorning, after having thought about it overnight. He\ntells the clerk, put in a new docket entry, order\nwithdrawn, motion to dismiss denied. No one knows about\nthis until quarter to 9:00. Defense doesn't even know\nabout it. What result in that case?\nMR. MORAN: That's very similar to Lowe v. State\nin the Kansas case in which the Kansas Supreme Court,\nafter this Court's decision in Smalis, concluded that a\njudge couldn't do that even though there had been no\nintervening proceedings. The judge had --\nQUESTION: What interest is served by such a\nrule?\nMR. MORAN: An acquittal is final. That is the\nmost fundamental rule of this Court's double jeopardy --\nQUESTION: Well, but what -- no one -- no one\nrelies on it. No one knew about it.\nMR. MORAN: But, Your Honor, this Court has said\nover and over again that an acquittal by a judge, in the\ncontext of a directed verdict, is equivalent to an\nacquittal by a jury. And the same --\nQUESTION: But he -- he didn't say, I acquit.\nThe judge himself said this at the trial, he said, I\ndidn't enter a directed verdict. I granted a motion.\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: In the judge's own mind, he didn't\nacquit.\nAnd what you're urging is so different from how\nwe approach trial rulings generally, and the point was\nmade that in a trial, things go fast, judge -- judges make\nrulings. It's very common, is it not, for a judge to make\na ruling and then go home that night, maybe read over the\ndaily transcript, maybe have her law clerk check a few\nauthorities, and say, oh, my goodness, I made a mistake,\nthe next morning. You couldn't run trials -- I mean, the\ntrial judges don't have the luxury that appellate judges\ndo in that regard. They have to make rulings on the spot,\nand they can revisit them. You -- you are suggesting that\nthis rule, like no other, is -- once the judge utters the\nwords, motion granted, that's the end of it.\nMR. MORAN: I'm not arguing that, Justice\nGinsburg. I am taking the position that if the judge\nimmediately corrects a mistake, as happened in People v.\nVilt, a case relied upon by the petitioner, that's\ndifferent.\nQUESTION: Well, what's different between --\nQUESTION: Why?\nQUESTION: -- saying at 4 o'clock in the\nafternoon, I grant your motion, and then overnight -- and\nthen they come back the next morning and the judge says,\nI'm not so sure. Prosecutor, tell me more about this.\nWhat's the difference of the overnight interval? Nothing\nhas happened. The trial hasn't gone on. No witnesses\nhave appeared.\nMR. MORAN: But, Your Honor, if that was the\nlaw, then Smalis v. Pennsylvania is impossible to\nunderstand because in Smalis the prosecution there could\nhave taken some sort of emergency appeal to the\nPennsylvania Supreme -- Pennsylvania Superior Court, got a\nruling late that afternoon, and come back the next morning\nand resumed the trial. And in fact, the prosecution tried\nexactly that in a Tenth Circuit case, United States versus\nEliason.\nQUESTION: I'm sorry. I don't follow you\nbecause I thought the judge in Smalis was firm throughout,\nthat he never equivocated about what his ruling was.\nMR. MORAN: Actually the judge in Smalis agreed\nto a reconsideration motion --\nQUESTION: But then he came up just where he was\nthe first time.\nMR. MORAN: Yes, that's -- that's right.\nWhat I'm saying is, is that if double jeopardy\ndoesn't protect -- if there's no double jeopardy\nviolation, if it can be revisited quickly, then Smalis is\nimpossible to understand because Smalis then would simply\ncome down to if you can do it quickly, if you can get an\nappeal to a higher court and a reversal quickly --\nQUESTION: Well, being -- being revisited on\nappeal is different from being revisited at the trial by\nthe trial judge. That's -- that's the distinction that's\nbeing drawn by your opponent here.\nMR. MORAN: Yes, Justice Scalia. And -- and the\npoint of that argument is that it makes it completely\ndispositive as to whether there are other defendants\nremaining, as I believe Mr. Chief Justice --\nQUESTION: You don't have to go that far at all.\nI mean, Smalis is not a case where the judge changed his\nmind, I take it. And this is a case where the judge\nchanged his mind.\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: So I'm back to my first question.\nThe judge says, Smith, you're acquitted. And 10 minutes\nlater he says, oh, my goodness, I used the wrong name. It\nwas Brown. Now, you're saying they can't retry Smith?\nMR. MORAN: If --\nQUESTION: My goodness, nothing at all happened\nin those 10 minutes. They were out drinking some water.\nMR. MORAN: If no further proceedings have\noccurred, and that is the line that almost all --\nQUESTION: All right. What -- what proceeding\noccurred? No proceeding occurred. They adjourned for the\nevening. He comes back the next day and, at best, he says\nfor you, well, I misspoke. I -- I didn't grant the\nmotion. So what's the difference whether -- we're back to\nJustice Ginsburg. We're all pursuing exactly same thing\nwhich I'm having trouble with, and --\nMR. MORAN: First of all, Justice Breyer, he\nsaid, I granted the motion. He took the position as a\nmatter --\nQUESTION: So does -- so does my judge. I grant\nthe motion. Smith -- Smith is acquitted.\nMR. MORAN: And he came back the next morning\nand said I granted your motion. He took the position that\nit didn't count --\nQUESTION:\nmotion. I acquitted Smith, but I misspoke. It was Brown\nI meant.\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: You're saying that in my case too\nSmith is home free.\nMR. MORAN: If further proceedings have\noccurred, which unquestionably occurred here, then\nfollowed by an overnight recess, during a trial a\ndefendant --\nQUESTION: Which were the further proceedings?\nMR. MORAN: There were five pages of proceedings\nthat are --\nQUESTION: What? You mean they spoke some more.\nMR. MORAN: No. On -- on joint appendix pages\n13 through 18, the parties litigated a number of other\nmatters, including in which order will --\nQUESTION: But they were all --\nQUESTION: But no -- no evidence -- no -- no\nwitnesses testified, did they?\nMR. MORAN: Not at that point, no. But what --\nQUESTION: There was nothing that -- that was\ndone to the defendant that the defendant himself did to\nhis detriment.\nMR. MORAN: We don't know because all we know --\nQUESTION:\nMR. MORAN: We know that his attorney made\ndecisions on matters such as who is going to go first,\nwill the defendants be present for each other's juries,\nwill witnesses be allowed in the courtroom, a\nsequestration order. He made those decisions at a point\nwhen his client had been acquitted of first degree murder.\nQUESTION: No, but is there any reason to\nbelieve that those decisions would have been different if\nhe had understood that first degree murder was going to be\nin the case?\nMR. MORAN: We simply don't know, Justice\nSouter. It's a --\nQUESTION: Well, we don't -- we don't know in\nthe sense that there -- there hasn't apparently been\nspecific litigation to that effect, but is there any\nreason to suspect that the decisions would have been\ndifferent? In other words, is there any reason whatever\nto -- to think that there may have been detrimental\nreliance here?\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Maybe there is, but what -- what is\nit then?\nMR. MORAN: Yes. Well, first of all, on those\nparticular decisions, we don't know and it's impossible to\nreconstruct that at this point.\nduring the overnight recess, Mr. Vincent and his\nattorney -- as this Court noted in Geders versus the\nUnited States, an overnight recess during a trial is a\ncritical time to make crucial decisions --\nQUESTION: No. I -- I realize that, but by the\ntime he departed for the overnight recess, he knew that\nthe judge was going to take the matter up again the next\nmorning. The judge had said so.\nMR. MORAN: That's actually not quite true as to\nMr. Vincent. Mr. Vincent was removed from the courtroom\nbefore the prosecutor said I would like to make a brief\nrestatement on first degree --\nQUESTION: But his lawyer knew.\nQUESTION: But his -- his counsel knew. His\ncounsel knew.\nMR. MORAN: His lawyer was still there. That's\nright.\nQUESTION: Yes. So -- so if -- if he -- if he\nrelied upon there being no change in the ruling, he was\ndoing so at his peril, was he not?\nMR. MORAN: The ruling had not been taken back,\nthough, Justice Souter. All --\nQUESTION: No, the ruling had not been taken\nback, but the -- the judge said, sure, I'll hear you,\nprosecutor, in the morning.\npeople. He made it -- he couldn't have made it more clear\nthat he did not understand that he had come to a final\nconclusion on that motion, could he?\nMR. MORAN: What -- all he agreed to do is hear\nmore argument. He did -- in no way indicate --\nQUESTION: But surely that -- that suggests that\nhe has not finally made up his mind.\nMR. MORAN: It suggests it, but it -- he\ncertainly doesn't say it.\nQUESTION: No.\nMR. MORAN: All -- he makes a general\nstatement --\nQUESTION: Well, as a betting man, would --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- would you not assume that there\nmight be a change as a result of what he had said before\nthey recessed?\nMR. MORAN: If I had been in trial counsel's\nposition, I wouldn't have known what to do because we have\na --\nQUESTION: Yes, you would. You would have\ndefended your client as best you could, and you would know\nthat you could not treat with security what the judge had\nsaid. If you did, you were endangering your client --\nMR. MORAN: But --\nQUESTION: -- because the judge had signaled\nthat he might reverse his ruling --\nMR. MORAN: But --\nQUESTION: -- the next morning.\nMR. MORAN: As trial counsel stated the next\nmorning, it was my impression that you made a firm ruling,\njudge. So --\nQUESTION: Then at trial the next morning, if\nwhat you say about the overnight being so critical to the\nstrategic planning, then counsel could say, judge, we\nplotted all this thing out, give me a recess so we can\nreshuffle the thing. At that point, if there was any\ndetrimental reliance, the way to do it was to give back\nthe hours that had been lost. Isn't that so?\nMR. MORAN: I don't know if that would be\npossible with a -- with two juries. There were actually\ntwo juries in this case sitting around waiting for\nthe defense to --\nQUESTION: It wasn't requested, though.\nMR. MORAN: It -- it wasn't requested because at\nthe end of the hearing, in which the prosecution made his\nimproved closing argument to the judge, there was no\nruling. The judge simply said, I'm going to think about\nit. I'm going to take it under advisement. He didn't\nmake the ruling until after Mr. Vincent testified.\nQUESTION: These are due process problems that\nyou're raising now, and I suppose we could always leave\nthem to be resolved by further proceedings below, inquiry\ninto whether there was any prejudice or not. But that\ndoesn't go to the point that's before us here which is\nwhether for purposes of double jeopardy, this -- this\nterminates the matter.\nMR. MORAN: I agree. This Court's precedents --\nQUESTION: So it's -- it's no use arguing, well,\nhe could have been prejudiced. Okay, he's prejudiced.\nWe -- we can take care of that.\nMR. MORAN: And --\nQUESTION: But that doesn't got to the double\njeopardy question.\nMR. MORAN: And I've taken the position in the\nbrief that we don't have to show prejudice. Under double\njeopardy, the prejudice is --\nQUESTION: Right. Absolutely.\nMR. MORAN: -- is inherent in being subjected to\npost-acquittal fact-finding proceedings.\nQUESTION: Not only do you not have to, it does\nyou no good to.\nMR. MORAN: I agree.\nQUESTION: Right, okay.\nQUESTION:\nSmith who -- who got off because --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- five pages -- of five pages of\nextraneous conversation went on with the -- the judge and\ncounsel. And I take it now you're going to say, yes, he\ngot off.\nMR. MORAN: Justice Breyer, yes. And -- and the\nreason --\nQUESTION: Okay, okay. That's what I thought\nyou would say. That's all right. That's fine.\nMR. MORAN: The rule from the Solicitor\nGeneral's position would make it completely dispositive as\nto whether there happened to be other charges remaining,\nas in Smalis itself, and whether or not there happened to\nbe other defendants.\nQUESTION: That's -- that may be true. That's\nwhy I'm nervous about the position. But still, you from\nyour point of view, unfortunately, lose as long as\nMichigan was -- was at least within the discretion that\nFederal law grants them in characterizing what happened\nhere as not an acquittal. I'm right about that.\nMR. MORAN: If they're correct that it was not\nan acquittal.\nQUESTION: Well, not correct. They -- they have\na degree of -- even under the law, that's -- I mean, under\nthe law section too.\nMR. MORAN: I agree. But if you look at the\ntrial judge's comments, he consistently maintains that\nhe -- he made a ruling. And ruling is actually the exact\nword from Martin Linen, that this Court has to decide\nwhether or not the trial judge made a ruling.\nQUESTION: Mr. Moran, I'd like to get back to an\nAEDPA question, and that is, as I understand it, there is\na division among lower courts on just how much leeway a\ntrial judge has to take back a directed verdict. And if\nthere is disarray in the lower courts, how can we say\nthere's clearly established law in your favor?\nMR. MORAN: Because what -- what AEDPA requires\nis not to look at the decisions of the lower courts, but\nto look to see whether the decision of the Michigan\nSupreme Court was a clearly unreasonable application.\nNow, I should point out, first of all, on that\nissue whether a judge can take back a directed verdict,\nthe Michigan Supreme Court did not rule against us, in\nfact indicated that it agreed with our position that a\njudge may not take back a directed verdict if he had -- if\nhe has actually rendered one. And the Michigan Court of\nAppeals ruled the same way.\nBut if you look at the split of authority, it's\na very striking split of authority.\nand rely upon Smalis on very similar situations where\nthere is a directed verdict, a partial directed verdict\nduring an ongoing trial, so the trial continues, and then\nthe judge attempts to take back the directed verdict at\nsome point later in the trial, those courts that have\napplied Smalis have, with one exception, held that the\njudge cannot do it. Those courts that have gone the other\nway have almost uniformly relied on a Second Circuit\ndecision, United States versus LoRusso, which says that\nthere is no problem with doing that because it does not\nresult in a second trial.\nAnd what this Court could not have been more\nclear about in Smalis is that a double jeopardy is\nviolated not only if a reversal of a directed verdict\nwould result in a second trial, but if it would result in\na continuation of the same trial.\nAnd that is why this case is constitutionally\nindistinguishable from Smalis. The only difference\nbetween this case and Smalis is that instead of going to a\nhigher court, as was attempted by -- in the Tenth Circuit\nin United States versus Ellison, what happened there is\nthat the prosecution -- there was a partial directed\nverdict, exactly as in this case. The prosecution ran\nacross --\nQUESTION:\nassuming the whole factual point at issue here, that there\nwas a partial directed verdict.\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: And in Smalis, there was no doubt\nabout that.\nMR. MORAN: Well, there was doubt as to what the\njudge had done. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court said it\nwasn't a directed verdict because it was a legal ruling\nand not a -- not --\nQUESTION: Well, but that -- that was a very\ntheoretical thing, whether as a matter of -- when you're\nsaying there's no evidence as a matter of law, that's a\nfactual ruling or a legal ruling.\nMR. MORAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: I -- I don't think that bears on our\ncase.\nMR. MORAN: No, and that is -- and that is a\ndistinction. That's why we have an issue one, Mr. Chief\nJustice, is -- is, of course, we have to get past the\nissue of was there a directed verdict. Then we get to\nissue two. If there was a directed verdict, can the judge\ntake it back? And that is where I maintain that this case\nis constitutionally indistinguishable from Smalis.\nOn -- on issue one, I -- I just wanted to make a\nfurther point about whether this is fact finding or a\nlegal finding. The Michigan Supreme Court itself did not\nregard what it was doing as fact finding. There was not\nthe slightest indication in the Michigan Supreme Court's\nopinion that it thought it was engaged in fact finding.\nNor did this Court think that it was engaged in fact\nfinding in several cases in which this Court has examined\narguably ambiguous district court transcripts to determine\nwhether or not an acquittal had been granted, for example,\nScott and even more clearly, Sanabria.\nIn Sanabria, this Court had to wade through a\ndifficult record to determine whether or not the district\ncourt had, in fact, granted a directed verdict on both\ntheories, numbers theory and horse betting theory.\nQUESTION: Well, let me follow up on an earlier\nquestion of Justice Breyer's. Do you think that if this\nis true under the Federal system that it was a directed\nverdict, it must therefore be true under the -- under\nan -- under any State system?\nMR. MORAN: Yes. I believe that follows\nimmediately, well, first of all, from Maryland v. Benton\nwhich applies Double Jeopardy Clause to the States, but\nalso from Crist --\nQUESTION: Well, but the fact that -- that that\ncase applies double jeopardy to the States I don't think\nnecessarily settles whether a particular State procedure\nis or is not a directed verdict.\nMR. MORAN: No. But it also follows from\nCrist v. Bretz in which this Court rejected a -- Montana's\nattempt to declare that jeopardy doesn't attach until the\nfirst witness is sworn in a jury trial. And this Court\nsaid, no. Where -- where jeopardy attaches and terminates\nis a matter of Federal constitutional law, and it\nconcluded, therefore, that Montana must follow the Federal\nrule to that point which is that jeopardy attaches when\nthe jury is sworn. And so this Court has consistently\napplied the same principles about jeopardy-attaching and\njeopardy-terminating events whether the cases arise in\nState or Federal court.\nQUESTION: Well, so the Federal rule is that it\nattaches when there's been a directed verdict, but it's up\nto State law when -- when there's been a directed verdict.\nI mean --\nMR. MORAN: Your Honor, I find that --\nQUESTION: -- there's nothing incompatible\nthere.\nMR. MORAN: Justice Scalia, I find that hard to\nsquare with Martin Linen which teaches us that what a\nreviewing court must do is putting aside form, looking at\nsubstance to decide whether the trial court has found an\nessential element of the offense is missing. And here,\nthe trial judge clearly stated that there is no\npremeditation been shown, that therefore second degree\nmurder is the appropriate charge, that a docket entry that\ncould not have been more clear was made to that effect on\nthat day, March 31st, 1992, and then followed by at least\nfive statements by the trial judge over the next 2 days\nexplaining that he had made a ruling, that he had directed\na verdict, come to a conclusion and made a decision --\nQUESTION: He kept saying I didn't direct a\nverdict. He was distinguishing as between granting a\nmotion. He says, I granted a motion, but I didn't direct\na verdict.\nMR. MORAN: Excuse me, Justice Ginsburg. You're\nquite correct. He said, I granted a motion. I didn't\ndirect a verdict. And his distinction was clearly one of\nlaw. He clearly believed that so long as the jury was not\ntold, there was a distinction between granting a motion\nand directing a verdict.\nAnd that position is untenable after Sanabria\nversus United States and also Martin Linen where the --\nthe United States made the same argument in Martin Linen,\nthat as long as it's the judge after the hung jury\ndeclaring a -- an acquittal, if it doesn't involve the\njury in some way, it doesn't count. The same argument was\napparently made in Sanabria and dismissed in a footnote\nthat it was so obviously -- so obviously contrary to\nMartin Linen.\nAnd so the judge never said as a fact -- as a\nfact -- I did not find absence of premeditation. He\nclearly found absence of premeditation, consistently\nadmitted that that's what he had done, but simply\nbelieved, as a matter of double jeopardy law, wrong as a\nmatter of double jeopardy law, that he could take back\nthat decision.\nThe Michigan Supreme Court's conclusion was\ncontrary even under the criteria that the Michigan Supreme\nCourt adopted, wanting to see certain formalities before\nthey would conclude that a acquittal has been granted.\nThat standard was met here. The Michigan Supreme Court\nitself acknowledged that a docket entry is exactly the\nsort of formality that they were looking for but then\ninexplicably failed to notice that there had been such a\ndocket entry made in this case. Not inexplicably the\nState failed to include the docket entry in its appendix\nin violation of the Michigan court rules. That's why the\nMichigan Supreme Court was apparently unaware of the\ndispositive docket entry.\nQUESTION: Wasn't that called to their attention\nin rehearing, though?\nMR. MORAN:\nreconsideration filed, yes, Justice Stevens.\nQUESTION: How do you explain their failure to\ngrant rehearing?\nMR. MORAN: Like this Court's denial of\ncertiorari there --\nQUESTION: That's not a discretionary matter, I\nwouldn't think, in a criminal case.\nMR. MORAN: I -- I believe it is. An appeal to\nthe Michigan Supreme Court is a discretionary matter in\nthe first place. And the denial of reconsideration is\ntraditionally treated as a discretionary matter under\nMichigan law.\nQUESTION: Even when there was an error of law\ncalled to their attention.\nMR. MORAN: Well, it's an error in the record I\nbelieve.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. MORAN: I -- I can't explain it. It was a\n5 to 2 vote for denial of reconsideration. I simply can't\nexplain how they came to that conclusion.\nThe bottom line here was, was Mr. Vincent\nsubjected to post-acquittal fact-finding proceedings in\nviolation of the Double Jeopardy Clause? Exactly as in\nSmalis, he was. Smalis -- there would have been\npost-acquittal fact-finding proceedings --\nQUESTION: May I ask you another question?\nAssume it would have been an acquittal as a matter of\nMichigan law because of the -- the docket entry. Would it\nnecessarily follow that it was also an acquittal for\npurposes of Federal law?\nMR. MORAN: Yes, Your Honor. I don't believe\nthat there has been any case distinguishing an acquittal,\nin quotation marks, for purposes of the Double Jeopardy\nClause from any other sort of an acquittal. An acquittal\nis defined in Martin Linen and this Court's --\nQUESTION: So your syllogism is that if he was\nacquitted as a matter of Michigan law, a fortiori the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause applies as a matter of Federal law.\nMR. MORAN: I believe he was acquitted for all\npurposes, Justice Stevens. I -- I don't believe that one\ncan profitably draw a distinction between being acquitted\nfor one purpose or another.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Moran.\nMr. Busch, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR A. BUSCH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BUSCH: Thank you, Your Honor.\nThe respondent here has stated that the Michigan\nSupreme Court agrees with his position with respect to the\nsecond prong of AEDPA.\nCourt stated in its opinion at footnote 4 -- it made\nreference to the fact that it was actually not reaching\nthe conclusion. It wasn't reaching a decision as to\nwhether the judge could change his mind.\nThe respondent's position essentially requires\nthe people to forfeit the second prong of AEDPA. Even if\nthe Court was wrong on its factual finding or\nunreasonable, the result of this case must be viewed\nwithin the filter of that statute which says that the law\nthat they applied was reasonable.\nThere are -- he has cited several cases and we\nhave several cases in the other direction, interestingly\nenough, including one, United States versus Baggett, which\ncomes out of the Sixth Circuit itself, which says -- in\nthat case there were -- three times the judge announced a\nruling and then agreed to hold it in abeyance. In -- in\nthat case the Court said that -- that -- the appeal court\nsaid that they were free to change their mind -- the judge\nwas free to change their mind any time prior to the entry\nof judgment.\nSo the courts -- there is -- there is no\nestablished precedent with respect to reconsideration, and\nwe would respectfully say that alternatively this Court\nought to find a rule that trial courts can reconsider\nwhere there has been no appeal and also -- and we would\nargue that the --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Busch.\nMR. BUSCH: Thank you.\n"
