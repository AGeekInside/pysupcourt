JOHNSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. JOHNSON: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\n35 U.S.C., section 101 is set out at page 19a in\nthe appendix of the blue brief.\nThe patents in this case that have been issued\non plant varieties under section 101 of title 35 are\ninvalid. They're invalid because Congress has enacted a\nspecific statutory scheme that it crafted to govern\nFederal statutory protection over this particular type of\nliving thing, plant varieties.\nThe enactment of Congress by this specific\nstatutory scheme that it designed to provide the Federal\nright to exclude others from reproducing plant varieties\nevidences Congress' intent that it plant-specific Federal\nstatutory scheme is intended to provide the exclusive\nFederal statutory means of excluding others from\nreproducing plant varieties.\nQUESTION: The rights conferred by the statute\nyou're referring to are somewhat different than the patent\nstatute, aren't they?\nMR. JOHNSON: I do not -- no, that is not\ncorrect, Mr. Chief Justice. The right that the patents\nclaim in this case, the plant patent -- or the 101 patents\nclaim in this -- in this case, is the right to exclude\nothers from sexually multiplying the corn plant varieties\nin this case or to use or sell corn plant varieties that\nhave been developed by sexual multiplication and -- and\nproduced by sexual multiplication. So, without using\nthese patents to exclude others from the right of sexually\nmultiplying these corn plants, the patent rights contended\nfor in this case would be of no value whatsoever.\nQUESTION: But I -- I had understood from the\nbriefs that the rights conferred under the Plant Act are\ndifferent in some respects from that under the general\npatent section. Am I wrong in that?\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe attribute that is protected under the plant-\nspecific acts is under the Plant Right of Protection Act\nof 1970, the right to exclude others from sexually\nmultiplying that plant.\nNow, this -- the statute is designed for\nparticular types of plants that require the ability to\nsexually reproduce on a large scale in order to be\ncommercially valuable, and these are plants that are only\nvaluable if they can be produced commercially by seed.\nNow, the -- the corn plants at issue in this\ncase -- the patents seek to protect the same utilitarian\nfeature or attribute of these corn plants, and that is the\nright to sexually multiply -- exclude others from sexually\nmultiplying these corn plants.\nQUESTION: Let me ask you a specific question.\nUnder the PVP, can a farmer who buys the -- raises a crop\none year save seed to use for himself the next year? If\nthat's the only protection that the -- that the developer\nhas is under the PVP, can the farmer do that?\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes, Mr. Justice Souter.\nQUESTION: All right. Can the farmer do that if\nthe protection is under section 101?\nMR. JOHNSON: No, Mr. Justice.\nQUESTION: Then isn't the answer to the Chief\nJustice's question yes, there is a difference in the\nrights which are conveyed by 101 and by a PVP license,\nrespectively?\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes, Justice Souter.\nQUESTION: Well, then why didn't you answer me\nthat way in the first place?\nMR. JOHNSON: I -- Mr. Chief Justice, because I\nmisapprehended the nature of the question and I thought\nthat you were asking about the attributes -- the\nattributes protected.\nAnd yes, the rights that are contended for under\nthe patent would be rights that do not -- that do not\ninclude the exceptions that Congress has specifically\nlegislated in the Plant Variety Protection Act, one of\nwhich would be the seed saving exemption, which was\nreaffirmed in the '94 amendments.\nAnd another crucial exception is the research\nexception because by the -- the use of patents, the free\nexchange of plant genetic material which had occurred\nprior to the use of patents, is prohibited by patents\nbecause the seed companies now contend that under the\npatent statute, since there's no research exemption, then\nthey can lock up the genes of the plant varieties on which\nthey have obtained patents.\nThose are two important distinctions between the\nrights conferred.\nNow, section 2541 -- section 2402 of the Plant\nVariety Protection Act --\nQUESTION: Before you go on, has any court ever\nheld that it would be patent infringement for the farmer\nto save the seeds?\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes, Your Honor. There are many\nsuits in litigation now where district courts have held in\na judgment against farmers for saving seed that are\nsubject to patents. And this is -- this is even true in\ncases of -- for example, one of the amici in this case,\nDelta and Pine Land Company --\nQUESTION: These are cases in the district\ncourts. How about courts of appeals?\nMR. JOHNSON: I do not believe that -- that I\nknow of -- that a seed saving case has reached a court of\nappeal -- a court of appeal yet.\nQUESTION: Does the PTO have a position on it?\nMR. JOHNSON: The Government is arguing as an\namici for Pioneer, for the -- for the appellee in this\ncase.\nQUESTION: Yes, but this case doesn't focus on\nthe saving seed exception.\nBut in distinguishing the utility patent from a\nPVP certificate, or whatever it is, you have pointed out\nthat the utility patent is more beneficial to the patent\nholder because the farmer can't even use the descendants\nof the first seeds to plant again. So that -- that's --\nand I asked you if the -- that -- that was the position,\nthat that's the interpretation of the utility patent, that\nis the interpretation of the PTO. And I think you said\nyes.\nMR. JOHNSON: I have not seen anything on that\nposition -- that position, one way or another, from the\nPTO.\nQUESTION: As far as the -- the issue that is\nbefore us, we do have a position of the PTO and of the\nFederal circuit, both having more expertise than the rest\nof the Federal court we're on in these questions. Don't\nwe owe those decision makers some deference?\nMR. JOHNSON: Justice Ginsburg, I believe that\nthis case is a case of statutory construction. With\nregard to the Chevron deference to the PTO, the Congress\nhas specifically legislated on the precise issue that the\nPTO has decided, that is, the issue of whether or not it\nhas authority under section 101 to grant patent -- utility\npatents on plant varieties. Congress has specifically\naddressed this issue on three different occasions\nhistorically and ruled on it. And I do not believe that\nChevron deference is -- can be accorded to an agency when\nCongress has specifically legislated.\nFurther, we are --\nQUESTION: Where has Congress said you can't get\na utility patent on a plant? Congress has set up two\nother protective regimes that are different from the\nutility patent. But where has it ever says -- said these\nexclude a patent?\nMR. JOHNSON: It has explicitly stated this in\nlegislative acts on two occasions. In 1930, when it\nenacted the Townsend-Purnell Plant Patent Act, it amended\nsection 4886 of revised statutes by adding to it language\nallowing --\nQUESTION: Because it thought, at least in part\n-- it thought that a plant couldn't qualify for a utility\npatent. So, it wanted to have something. Science has\nadvanced. This Court acknowledged that you could get a\nutility patent for whatever was the bacteria that was in\nthe Chakrabarty case.\nMR. JOHNSON: Let me go back, if I may, for a\nmoment, and I'll answer your question on Chakrabarty.\nIn 1930, Congress placed -- or added to section\n4884 of revised statutes the limitation on the -- that it\nwas -- the right was limited to asexual reproduction --\nexcluding others from asexually reproducing the plant.\nBut it is important to note -- and this is set out at\ncert. app., page -- appendix 42.\nYou will also see section -- I think it's 4888\nof revised statutes. And in that section, Congress in\n1930 inserted the -- or put in the provision that relaxed\nthe written description requirement. Now, if --\nQUESTION: This is section 4884?\nMR. JOHNSON: This is in the petition\nappendix --\nQUESTION: Page 42 of the --\nMR. JOHNSON: Page 42.\nQUESTION: And which of the sections that are\ncited there are you referring to?\nMR. JOHNSON: Just a moment here. Section 4888.\nIt put in the relaxed written description requirement.\nNow, there were two reasons why, as Justice\nGinsburg points out, there was some historic -- there was\nsome historic feeling against patents on plants. It was a\nliving thing, a product of nature doctrine, written\ndescription. It relaxed the written description in 4888.\nIf the language that Thomas Jefferson penned in\n1793, which is the definitional language for utility\npatents -- and he was a plant breeder, knew what plants\nwere -- if that language already subsumed plants, then the\nonly thing that Congress needed to do in 1930 was to add\nsection 4888.\nAnd if it decided that it wanted to somehow --\nif -- if the language that -- that Thomas Jefferson penned\nincluded plants in 1930 and it included sexual\nmultiplication of plants and they wanted to limit it, then\nthey could have just put in the asexual limitation. But\nwhat they did is, they put in all three sections in 1930\nbecause it was their intent to expand the definitional\nlimits of section 4886, which was the definitional\nlanguage that Thomas Jefferson originally wrote.\nQUESTION: Well, in other words, there's the\nscheme established in 1930 and it is both more inclusive\nthan a 101 patent, and it gives you fewer rights. But\nthat isn't -- doesn't mean, to track Justice Ginsburg's\ninitial question, that this is an explicit prohibition on\nissuing a patent under 101.\nMR. JOHNSON: We have to give meaning to what\nCongress did in 1930. It did not --\nQUESTION: If you want to say if -- that we\nshould infer it, fine. That's your argument, but it's not\nan explicit prohibition.\nMR. JOHNSON: In 1950, in the revision of the\nPatent Act, Congress dissembled section 4886 and placed\nthe plant patent language from 4886 in a separate chapter,\nand kept the Thomas Jefferson language in -- and placed\nthat in section 101. And the other language from 486 and\n488 -- or 4888 and 4884 were also placed in chapter 15, a\nseparate plant-specific act.\nNow, if the language -- if the definitional\nlanguage of 101, the other definitional language, subsumed\nplants, there would be no reason to -- to take that\nlegislative action.\nQUESTION: Then why -- why shouldn't Chakrabarty\nhave come out the other way? Because Chakrabarty involved\na plant. It involved, I guess, an asexually reducing\nplant. I don't think bacteria reproduce sexually. And it\nseems to me on your reasoning, the Court in Chakrabarty\nshould have said this is the paradigm example of what was\ncovered by the -- or what is covered by the PPA and\ntherefore it shouldn't fall under 101. And the Court went\nthe other way. So, explain to me why -- why Chakrabarty\nis not a problem for you.\nMR. JOHNSON: What the Court did in Chakrabarty\nwas affirm Judge Giles Rich's footnote 25 in the\nunderlying circuit court case, Application of Bergy. In\nChakrabarty, the patented item was an oil-eating bacteria.\nNow, the Court discusses in Chakrabarty. Nobody knows\nexactly why, but bacteria are specifically excluded from\nthe Plant Variety Protection Act.\nQUESTION: They're -- they're -- yes, the PVP\nbut they're not expressly -- I guess the -- the PPA\ndoesn't say anything about them one way or the other. It\nsimply remains the case that under the PPA, this is a --\nthe PPA deals with a -- with a plant insofar as it is a\nnon-sexually reproducing or a non-sexually reproduced --\nand I think that's the -- the fact that the Court had\nbefore it in Chakrabarty.\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, in Chakrabarty, Justice\nSouter, the dissent argued that the existence of the\nplant-specific acts evidenced Congress' intent that no\nliving thing could be subject to a 101 patent. The\nmajority, 5 to 4, the tie-breaking vote said, that's not\ntrue. It -- it doesn't mean that the mere fact that\nsomething is living denies that item potential or possible\nsection 101 -- a section 101 patent. And it -- it\ndiscussed these plant-specific acts.\nThen in the last paragraph of Chakrabarty, it\ntells us the two ways in which Congress can evidence its\nintent to exclude a specific type of living thing from\nsection 101 coverage. It says, one, it can just -- it\ncould explicitly do -- it can explicitly state that carve-\nout, and it used the carve-out of patenting of materials\nthat could be employed in nuclear weapons as an example of\na specific carve-out.\nAnd then it said secondly it can craft a\nspecific statute designed to provide protection for a\nparticular type of living organism. And in that -- in\nthis case, that -- in the case of the PVP and the PPA,\nthat is plant varieties.\nAnd Justice Rich stated this explicitly in the\nunderlying opinion, Application of Bergy, which the\nChakrabarty Court, of course, read and -- and was aware of\nwhen it wrote this paragraph. Justice -- or Judge Giles\nquoted this -- this piece of legislative history where the\nSenator said, anything under the sun that is made by man.\nIt is this piece of legislative history that Pioneer's\ncase is built upon. That's the foundation.\nQUESTION: No, but could we go back, though, to\nthe facts of -- of Chakrabarty? Because the problem that\nI -- I have is it seems to me that on -- on just the\nauthorities that you're speaking of, Chakrabarty probably\nshould have come out the other way because you had a\nspecific statute, the PPA, which covered this asexually\nreproducing plant, a bacterium, and yet the Court did not\nsay that the coverage of 101 was thereby defeated. And --\nand maybe I'm missing something. I don't understand why,\non your theory, it shouldn't have come out the other way.\nMR. JOHNSON: I don't believe that the\nChakrabarty Court viewed the bacterium as a plant.\nQUESTION: Well, what else could it view it as?\nI mean, I --\nMR. JOHNSON: They spoke --\nQUESTION: I went to the dictionary. I -- I\nwasn't sure myself, and I went to the dictionary, and the\ndictionary says it's a plant.\nMR. JOHNSON: I -- the Chakrabarty Court spoke\nof it as a microorganism.\nQUESTION: Which is a generic term.\nMR. JOHNSON: And the -- as -- as I read\nChakrabarty, their discussion of the PVPA and their\ndiscussion of the PPA was for the purposes of explaining\nhistorically how they evolved and to disassemble the\ndissent's argument that those two -- that those two\nspecific acts meant you couldn't patent any living thing.\nI do not think --\nQUESTION: Well, I don't want to prolong this.\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: But I take it then on -- on your\nposition, if we assume that the bacterium is a plant and\nit asexually reproduces, the decision in Chakrabarty\nshould have been that it's covered by the PPA and there's\nno 101 patent.\nMR. JOHNSON: If it would -- if it would be a\nplant variety and if reproducing by dividing, which is not\nsexual -- it's certainly not sexual multiplication as --\nas plants do it, then that would be -- then the decision\nshould have been that it could have qualified for a PPA\npatent.\nQUESTION: And therefore, it couldn't qualify\nfor a 101. Right?\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes. It would not -- well --\nQUESTION: On -- on your --\nMR. JOHNSON: It would not be blocked. It would\nnot be blocked from a 101 patent simply on the basis that\nit is alive.\nQUESTION: No, but it would be blocked by the\nfact, on your reasoning, that it was covered by PPA.\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: But is -- has anybody ever held it\nwas a -- a bacterium is a plant? I mean --\nMR. JOHNSON: I have not --\nQUESTION: -- did any court ever say that or the\nPatent Office or somebody?\nMR. JOHNSON: I have never seen anything, you\nknow, of that.\nQUESTION: So, the dictionary --\nQUESTION: My -- my dictionary holds that.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Maybe when Chakrabarty was decided\npeople didn't look so carefully at dictionaries as they do\nnow.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Because certainly the opinion doesn't\nsay this, does it? The opinion doesn't call the bacteria\na plant.\nMR. JOHNSON: I certainly didn't -- it took\npains to point out that -- well, it said one of the\nreasons why the PVPA may have exclusive -- or explicitly\nexcluded it was because it may have felt that it wasn't a\nplant. I think there was some case somewhere that they\ncited that had alluded to that.\nQUESTION: Mr. Johnson, there's one piece of\nthis case that's somewhat disturbing in that -- in that am\nI right in thinking that it is relatively harder to get a\nutility patent, that you have to convince the PTO and you\nhave to have more documentation and involve yourself with\na lawyer's fee -- much harder to get a 101 registration\nthan it is to get a certificate under the PVPA?\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, I saw a lot of that in amici\nbriefs, but there's not a scintilla of evidence on it in\nthe record.\nQUESTION: But are you --\nMR. JOHNSON: I think the --\nQUESTION: Are you suggesting that -- let's take\nthis case -- that this particular item could not have\nqualified, maybe it wouldn't qualify for a PVPA\ncertificate?\nMR. JOHNSON: Every -- all 17 corn plant\nvarieties that are the subjects of the patents that we\nhave challenged in this case also applied for and obtained\nPlant Variety Protection certificates.\nQUESTION: Oh, so they do have both. They do\nhave the dual protection.\nMR. JOHNSON: In this case, they do have both,\nand there's --\nQUESTION: And I thought that the infringing\naction here would infringe a PVP certificate as well. I\nthought your position was -- was -- and I must be wrong\nabout that -- that -- that you would be an infringer if\nthey had a 101 patent.\nMR. JOHNSON: First --\nQUESTION: But they don't have a 101 patent, so\nthey have nothing.\nMR. JOHNSON: Right. We weren't sued under the\nPVP Act. We were sued under the Patent Act, number one.\nNumber two, we never sexually multiplied the\nseed nor did we engage in any act which involves further\nmultiplication or propagation of the plant. And under the\nPlant Variety --\nQUESTION: So, you're telling me they did have\nthe dual protection, but either they chose not to charge\nyou with -- with infringing on the PVP protection or you\ndidn't do anything that would infringe that protection.\nMR. JOHNSON: We -- we didn't do anything to\ninfringe it. The -- the section 2541(d) is set out at\npage 18 of the appendix of the blue brief. And it says\nthat any of the above acts -- and all the other acts that\nare listed as infringement, which would include selling --\nare not infringements unless they involve further\npropagation of the protected variety.\nThe reason that that provision is in there is\nbecause in 1970, the brokerage business in seed corn and\ncotton seed, soybean seed was already a thriving business.\nIt was not the intent of Congress to inject itself into\nmarketing situations that are governed by State law or by\nthe Federal Seed Act. It had one thing in mind and that\nwas to regulate the right to exclude others from sexually\nmultiplying plant varieties. It wasn't in the market of\nsuing people who just bought the bagged seed, didn't do\nanything with it, sold it to farmers who just planted that\nseed and took it to the elevator.\nSo, it's not a PVP violation, number one, and\nnumber two, we weren't sued under the Plant Variety\nProtection Act anyway. We were sued under the Patent Act.\nIt was the act of choice.\nNow, the 1970 Plant Variety Protection Act\nprovides at section 2581 that the purpose of the act is to\nprovide adequate encouragement for research. Congress --\nthe presidential commission was convened in 1965 to decide\nwhat sort of protection should we give to sexually\nreproducing plants. '68 the Senate Patent Subcommittee\nhad hearings on amending title 35. There was -- there\nwere objections. It took no further action.\nHearings continued in the Agriculture\nDepartment, and this 1970 PVP Act came out to -- to\nprovide adequate protection to encourage research. That\nwas Congress' intent in crafting this statute. They set\nup a separate agency. They set up a separate board with\nmandated representation of affected political interests,\nincluding farmers, including the public sector, including\nresearchers. They set up the seed saving exemption, the\nresearch exemption.\nNow, if -- if the argument is accepted that,\nwell, the reason that Congress did this was because they\nmisapprehended the ability to -- of technology to advance\nand make it easier to, say, identify or describe a plant\nvariety or because of some other technological advance,\nwell, if -- that is simply saying that the intent of\nCongress in 1970 was based on a mistaken apprehension or\nsomething that's proved mistaken today.\nBut to take that position assumes that if\nCongress had apprehended correctly, as Pioneer's amici\nsaid they should have, then that Congress would have\nsimply adopted section 101 without the special agency,\nwhich -- without the board, which is -- which has to have\nrepresentatives of experts from the various varieties,\nwithout seed saving, without research, without all of the\ndistinctions that it specifically intentionally enacted in\nthe Plant Variety Protection Act, and that is too great a\nleap for us to take in my -- in a judicial setting.\nIt's a political question. It's a question for\nCongress to answer and Congress has answered it.\nEverything that went into the crafting of the Plant\nVariety Protection Act was the result of politics.\nAnd that is if -- if in some fashion, which I\nsee a lot -- a lot of the -- of Pioneer's and its amici's\nargument points out that, well, it now looks like its a\nbetter idea to have patent protection than Plant Variety\nProtection Act protection. Well, that is an argument to\nbe made in the -- on the Hill to the Congress where they\nhave the resources to examine all of this evidence that\nhas been put before this Court in the amici briefs that is\nnot in the record in this case.\nAs far as the ease -- the record -- the evidence\nthat's in the record in this case is that it's harder to\nget a Plant Variety Protection certificate because there\nwas the corn hybrids that were patented in this case. The\ninbred parents were not deposited, only the hybrid seed.\nThe hybrid seed, when you plant it, you get all different\ntypes of plants. You cannot recreate the hybrid without\nhaving the inbred parents' deposit. The PVP requires\ndeposit of the inbred seed.\nThe PVP requires that you give the breeding\nhistory. There's no requirement of that for the patent.\nThe PVP allows the research exemption. Why is\nthat important? Because of this. The DNA in plants is a\nstorehouse of knowledge, a storehouse of genetic\nknowledge. The RNA conveys that message and the message\nis manifested in the characteristics of the offspring of\nthe plant. Only when you have -- when a plant breeder has\nthe opportunity to actually grow the plant, observe it,\ncross it, observe and test the offspring can the plant\nbreeder obtain the knowledge that is in the ostensibly\npatented plant. And without that -- without that\nopportunity, then the full disclosure that supposedly is\nmade under the Patent Act when they patent plant varieties\nis not -- is not made.\nAnd it is -- it is an extremely important matter\nthat the Plant Variety Protection Act guarantees to the\npublic, and that is the free use and transmission of\ngenetic material, which patents are being used to stop.\nThere's been, as you know, a extreme consolidation of the\nagricultural industry, and the switch to patents and the\nlocking up of plant germ plasm is a key impetus in that\nconsolidation.\nIf there are no further questions, I'll reserve\nthe rest of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Johnson.\nMr. Sease, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDMUND J. SEASE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SEASE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIn response to my colleague's representation\nthat Pioneer's sole case here rests upon a snippet of\nstatement in the legislative history of the '52 act,\nquoted in Chakrabarty where the Court said, machined or\nmanufactured can include anything under the sun made by\nman, we do, of course, rely on that piece of legislative\nhistory, as did Chakrabarty.\nBut our case rests not upon that. Our case\nrests upon 35 U.S.C., section 101, which is in the regular\npatent statute that says, and the plain meaning of those\nwords, as confirmed in Chakrabarty, that the corn plants\nthat are patented here are either articles of manufacture\nor compositions of matter. Or the fact of the matter is,\nunder the definitions cited with approval in Chakrabarty,\nthey're both because these categories of statutory subject\nmatter, under section 101 -- that is, they are sort of a\ngatekeeper. You got to pass through that gate to go on to\nthe next criteria of whether you are new, useful, or\nnonobvious and can get a patent.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I suppose their point was\nthat in many statutes, if A, B, and C are covered and C is\nthen removed, we make the inference that C is not intended\nto be covered any longer. But in this case, the under the\nsun language shows that they are such expansive terms in\n101, that perhaps we don't apply that usual rule and that\nyou would prevail because of the terms being so general\nand so universal in their -- in their coverage.\nMR. SEASE: Justice Kennedy --\nQUESTION: I take it that's your position.\nMR. SEASE: They -- that is our position. They\nneed to be general because the patent law needs to fit\never-changing circumstances because today's science\nfiction is tomorrow's science, and we are not in a\nposition to foresee what tomorrow's inventions will be.\nAnd so, from 1793 till now, the statute has been crafted\nand interpreted broadly. And the -- the terms, indeed,\nhave been construed to overlap. And so, the categories\nthat are expressed there are not necessarily exclusive --\nQUESTION: May I --\nMR. SEASE: -- something to fit one or more.\nQUESTION: I didn't mean to interrupt you.\nWill you comment? Would you go on from what\nyou're saying to comment on -- on a point that Mr. Johnson\nmade a moment ago? As I understand it, the -- the outline\nof the argument is even though the language in 101 is\nindeed just as broad as -- as you say and even though\nChakrabarty said living things aren't excluded, the\nexistence of -- of a separate statute dealing with the\nsame subject matter may be taken as -- as an implied\nrepeal to some extent if there's a conflict.\nAnd one argument for saying that there is no\nconflict here, as I understand it, is the argument that\nwhat is set up by section 101 on the one hand and the two\nseparate plant statutes on the other are really two\nseparate regimes. It's harder to get a 101 patent, so you\nget more protection. It's easier to get a -- we'll say, a\nPVP certificate, so you get less protection. And\ntherefore, you shouldn't see them as -- as conflicting.\nYou should see them as kind of hierarchical and the -- the\napplicant can choose what he wants.\nMr. Johnson says, as I understood him a minute\nago, that that's not a sound argument because in fact he\nsays it's more difficult to get a PVP certificate than it\nis to get a -- a 101 patent. And he -- he mentioned a\ncouple of things that you have to do that you might not\nhave to do under 101.\nWould you comment on -- on that -- that\ndifficulty point of his?\nMR. SEASE: Yes. With all due respect to my\ncolleague, I believe he's wrong. The title 35 patents,\nthe regular utility patents, require novelty, usefulness,\nand nonobviousness. This Court defined how one determines\nnonobviousness in Graham v. Deere in 1966, and it has been\nuniversally applied by the Patent Office and by the courts\nsince that date. And as a matter of fact, the patents\nthat we're sued on here, if you look in their file\nhistories, one would see that they were routinely rejected\nfor obviousness by the Patent Office, and that was the big\nhurdle that had to be overcome before they could issue.\nThe Plant Patent Act requires asexual and\nrequires new, distinct, and probably also nonobviousness.\nThe Patent Variety Protection Act requires new, distinct,\nuniform, and stable. There is no requirement whatsoever\nakin to nonobviousness in the Plant Variety Protection\nAct. And it in fact, Your Honor, is almost a registration\nsystem, very similar to like the copyright system where\nyou file, you fill out a form, and it's granted without\nany kind of a rigorous examination as utility patents\nundergo in the United States. And our system, I might\nadd, is recognized as one of the stronger ones in the\nworld primarily because of our unobviousness requirement.\nQUESTION: Is there any other situation in the\nrealm of intellectual property where you have this kind of\ndual regime, where you have both the standard kind of\npatents, then you have to the side of that a patent-like\nprotection?\nMR. SEASE: Justice Ginsburg, the answer to that\nis there's nothing like it in the patent world, but there\nare analogous dual systems, if you will, in the\nintellectual property world, whereas it's common, for\nexample, for the same tangible item to have both design\npatent protection and to have copyright protection. That\nwas looked at in the case of Mazer v. Stein. It is common\nfor trade secret protection and patent protection to\npeacefully coexist --\nQUESTION: You can have overlapping patents,\ntrade secrets. But -- but this is kind of a specialized\npatent. It's called a plant patent. That, you say, is\nunique to plants.\nMR. SEASE: I -- I think it is, Your Honor.\nAnd the reason historically that it came about\nthat we have these three separate regimes that occur for\nplants is that plant inventors, if you will, were being\ndiscriminated against in that they were unable to comply\nwith the rigorous requirements of title 35 for a regular\nutility patent not because there was any definitional\nwrong in section 101, but because in application, the\nPatent Office was routinely rejecting them -- and I'm\ntalking about prior to 1930 -- as products of nature, and\nthe inventors were unable to meet the written description\nrequirement necessary to get a patent, so important to a\npatent because the written description requirement is how\nthe public benefits from the knowledge from the patent so\nthat they can use it to advance and build greater\nknowledge. And so, the Plant Patent Act of 1930 was\npassed to allow some limited rights for asexually\nreproduced plants, and the Plant Variety Protection Act of\n1970 was passed to allow again some rights for sexually\nproduced plants.\nNow, this petitioner would turn those two acts\nand their legislative history on their head and use them\nto limit patent coverage when, in fact, they were passed\nby Congress for the purpose of granting some coverage that\nwas like a patent in order to get over the two historical\nhurdles of section 112, written description requirement,\nand the so-called product of nature doctrine.\nQUESTION: Why is it --\nQUESTION: May I ask a question about -- about\nthis particular case? Is it true, as Mr. Johnson told us,\nthat you have dual protection and that you sued only under\nsection 101, that all these 17 varieties also have Plant\nVariety Protection certificates?\nMR. SEASE: Justice Ginsburg, I -- there is no\nreal record on that. At the trial court, the complaint\nwas filed, the answer was filed, and then the motion for\nsummary judgment was filed, and that's where we are.\nThere was, however, a transcript at the trial\ncourt where a Pioneer lawyer was asked by the judge if\nPioneer gets PVPA certificates routinely with respect to\nmatters that they also get utility patents, and I believe\nthe question was answered yes with respect to inbreds.\nBut in this instance, there are hybrid patents as well,\nthat there are no corresponding PVPA certificates, and the\nsuit was filed on only the utility patents.\nQUESTION: You -- consistently with your answer\nto me a moment ago that the PVPA certificate is almost a\nkind of registration mechanism, I -- I'm assuming that\ntherefore it probably doesn't take long to get it.\nMR. SEASE: They take much less time, yes,\nthrough the Department of --\nQUESTION: So that you would -- if you -- let's\nassume you filed for both. You would -- if -- if you're\nplant breeder, you would expect to get your certificate\nrather quickly, and you'd expect to wait longer for the\n101 process to wend its way.\nMR. SEASE: If at all you ever get through the\n101 process.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. SEASE: One never knows, at the time you\nmake the invention, whether you are going to meet\nsuccessfully the higher standards of the Patent Utility\nAct or not. And so, I mean, the unique -- the truth is\nthat I think everybody in this world, not unique to just\nthis client -- they try for both and see what happens.\nSometimes they are successful, sometimes they are not.\nI -- I would like to --\nQUESTION: Well, wait. On that particular\npoint, the only way in which it would seem to be of some\nsignificance that the patent statute would be stricter\nis in respect to what you just said, nonobviousness. And\n-- and the other you could -- you have to show it's new.\nSo, in the one, the more detailed one, you have to show\nit's new, and in the patent one, you have to show it's new\nand nonobvious.\nMR. SEASE: That's right.\nQUESTION: All right. That's a little bit of a\ndifference.\nMR. SEASE: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Fine.\nNow, what conceivable thought would have been\ngoing through a Congressman's mind to enact the following?\nHe says, okay, I see there's this difference here. So, if\na seed is new, but obviously new, I'll let the farmers\nsave the seeds for next year, and I will let people do\nresearch. But if the seed is new and nonobviously new, I\nwon't let the farmers keep the seeds for next year, and I\nwon't let people do research.\nNow, in other words, what could anybody have\nbeen thinking who would write that? And on your theory,\nthat's what they must have been thinking.\nMR. SEASE: Your Honor, I -- I would disagree\nwith that, respectfully. Under --\nQUESTION: But the question was not -- what was\nthe theory? That isn't a question you could disagree with\nor not disagree with.\nMR. SEASE: The theory -- the theory was -- and\none must look at the statute, Your Honor. The save seed\nexemption and the research exemption under the Plant\nVariety Protection Act are -- are not grants of rights to\nanybody. They are simply saying that by doing these,\nthese are not infringing acts under the Plant Variety\nProtection Act.\nQUESTION: But you see -- let me show where I'm\ncoming from. A property -- intellectual property involves\nthe following: copyright, a tax on readers for producing\nbooks; patent, a tax on users for the purpose of\nencouraging invention. Those are the wholesale statutes.\nPatent, copyright. Sometimes Congress -- and quite often\n-- says, the wholesale statutes, they're too wholesale.\nWe're going to go into this thing and retail. Now, that's\nwhat they did here, and they came up with a slightly\ndifferent kind of protection.\nSo, having done that for whatever reason,\nwhether because of mistake or because of this or because\nof that, they did it. So, why should we assume they'd\nlike to go back to the wholesale statute, once having gone\nthrough the work of written the retail and indeed created\nspecial exemptions of importance that don't exist at\nwholesale?\nMR. SEASE: Well, nothing in the Plant Variety\nProtection Act or the Plant Patent Act or its legislative\nhistory shows that Congress ever intended to take anything\nout of section 101 that was already included in section\n101, and that included these plants. They were articles\nof manufacture and they were compositions of matter.\nQUESTION: Well, they had before them, quoted in\nyour brief I think, Simon Rifkin's committee's report,\nwhich says all provisions in the patent statute for plant\npatents should be deleted and another form of protection\nprovided. That was the President's commission's\nrecommendation. And having received that recommendation,\nthey didn't follow it completely, but they did write some\nthings in detail. So why, given that in front of them,\nshould we assume Congress wanted to go back to this\nwholesale statute?\nMR. SEASE: Because if you were to say that the\npassing of the Plant Variety Protection Act in 1970\nsomehow is an implicit narrowing of 35 U.S.C., section 101\nor an implicit exclusion of subject matter from that, you\nneed a far greater signal than just that.\nQUESTION: You've got the principle in your\nfavor that repeals, by implication, are not favored.\nMR. SEASE: Yes.\nAnd the case law of this Court says that there\nmust be -- they must be plainly inconsistent in order to\nhave a repeal by implication. And that is an important\nstandard, that plainly inconsistent, because Congress\nneeds to be able to rely on that in order to understand\nthe consequences of acts that they are -- they are\npassing.\nQUESTION: So, what does the farmer do who wants\nto save his seeds?\nMR. SEASE: What the farmer does who wants to\nsave his seed is he can, indeed, save those seed if they\nare protected under the Plant Variety Protection Act only,\nbut not if they are protected under the utility patent\nstatute.\nQUESTION: Well, he can get permission. He can\npay for permission.\nMR. SEASE: He can pay for permission. That's\ncorrect.\nQUESTION: Is it your view -- nobody has really\ntalked about the infringement under the basic patent\nstatute, but if I was a farmer and I just bought the\nseeds, you tell me it's a patented product and I plant the\nseeds. The next year I want to use the product of the --\nthat plant and save some of those seeds to plant the next\nyear. That's an infringement?\nMR. SEASE: That's an infringement of the\nutility patent.\nQUESTION: Why is that an infringement? Why\ndoesn't he just own -- own what he purchased?\nMR. SEASE: He does own what he purchased but\nonly in the volume that he purchased. He cannot self-\nreplicate that because the right to exclude --\nQUESTION: You're -- you're saying that -- that\nthe infringement -- it's not just an infringement of a\nlicense agreement or anything like a contractual\nundertaking, but the patent statute itself is sufficient\nto make his saving seeds an infringement in your view.\nMR. SEASE: Under the utility patent statute\nbecause the utility patent statute gives the right to\nexclude others from making, using, or selling.\nQUESTION: But he's not -- but he's purchased\nit. He's purchased the product.\nMR. SEASE: He purchased -- he purchased one set\nvolume of the product.\nQUESTION: Correct.\nMR. SEASE: The recreation of that by planting\nand regrowth is a subsequent infringing act.\nQUESTION: What is the best authority you have\nfor that proposition?\nMR. SEASE: Pardon?\nQUESTION: Is there any case holding that, any\nappellate court case holding that?\nMR. SEASE: There is no specific case in the\nseed area that -- that I'm aware of that holds that, but\nit -- it is sort of analogous to the repair/reconstruction\ndoctrine in the utility patent statute.\nQUESTION: It's not analogous to running a -- a\nmimeograph machine and requiring the user to use your\npaper. It's not analogous to that.\nMR. SEASE: It isn't.\nBut one of the reasons why utility patent\nprotection is so critically important to people in this\nindustry is because that seeds are so easily copied by\nself-replicating. And so, if you can qualify for the\nhigher standard, you need to have that higher standard\nbecause of the ease of replication.\nAnd may I point out, Your Honor, we know --\nQUESTION: What -- what do they do with the\nseeds? They throw them in the river or what?\nMR. SEASE: What does who do?\nQUESTION: What -- do they throw -- have to\nthrow the seeds away or something?\nMR. SEASE: Well, hybrid seed is only good --\nand these patents are on hybrid seed, most of them -- is\nonly good for 1 year because you cannot take the seed from\na hybrid seed and then plant it and get the same plant\nback. That does not work with a hybrid.\nQUESTION: But for something that it does work\nfor, is -- is the answer but you can't use the descendants\nof your original seed, so you have to throw them away?\nMR. SEASE: You can't use the descendants of\nyour original seed to plant a new crop. You sell your\ncrop.\nQUESTION: Yes. But what can -- what can you\nuse them for?\nMR. SEASE: You -- you can use them for their\nordinary intended purpose which, for example, if the seed\nis soybean, you -- you sell your crop at the end of the\nyear like a farmer does. You buy more seed for the\nfollowing year.\nQUESTION: Yes, but the seeds that you would\notherwise have saved, the seeds that you would have saved\nif -- if it were only plant variety protection, you can't\ndo anything with them.\nMR. SEASE: If there --\nQUESTION: As Justice Kennedy said, you just\nhave to throw them out?\nMR. SEASE: If -- if there is utility patent\ncoverage, you can't do anything with them unless you make\nsome sort of arrangement with the patent owner.\nQUESTION: You could put them out for the birds.\nYes.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Yes. The one thing you can do is\nsell them so some creature can eat them.\nMR. SEASE: We are not operating in a vacuum\nhere about what Congress believes is correct, Your Honors,\nand I would like to make that point. In 1999 in an\namendment to section 119 of the patent statute, which\nallows foreign inventors to take advantage of their\nforeign filing date when they come here and file in the\nUnited States, we passed an amendment under section 119(f)\nthat allowed foreign breeders, certificate holders,\nanalogous to these Plant Variety Protection Act\ncertificates, to use that filing date in their foreign\ncountry to get utility patents when they come into the\nUnited States. So, Congress passed a law which is\nimplementing and enhancing the very thing that is\noccurring here.\nAnd to make any doubt about that crystal clear,\nin 1994, when there were amendments to the Patent Variety\nProtection Act, Senator Kerrey set out the whole regime in\nthe legislative history of that modification that occurred\nin 1994, explaining utility patents, explaining Plant\nVariety Protection Act certificates, and explaining the\nPPA, and noting the differences between them. And he did\nthat on the floor of the Congress. So, it is hardly news\nto Congress that this is and has been occurring.\nQUESTION: Yes, but that's -- that's\ninconsistent with the argument you make on the first half\nof the case, that Congress' understanding of the -- of the\nstatute is irrelevant in light of our interpretation. You\ncan't have it both ways.\nMR. SEASE: Well, I don't say that Congress'\nunderstanding of the statute is irrelevant. I point out\nthat corn plants, which are the subject matter of these\npatents, fall within the plain meaning of the terms of\nsection 101, and therefore are a patentable subject\nmatter.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Sease.\nMr. Wallace, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nIN SUPPORT OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. WALLACE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIn Diamond against Chakrabarty, the Plant Patent\nAct and the Plant Variety Protection Act played a central\nrole in the debates between counsel and between the\nCourt's opinion and the dissenting opinions. The Court in\nChakrabarty rejected the position of the Government and of\nthe dissenting Justices that those two statutes showed a\ncongressional understanding that living things are not\nprotectable under section 101 and could be protected only\ninsofar as that subject matter was covered in those two\nstatutes and to the extent to which it was covered. The\nCourt, instead, adopted a -- a broad interpretation based\non the plain meaning of section 101 referring to the\nanything under the sun quotation, but also said quite\nspecifically at page 313 of volume 447 that the relevant\ndistinction is not between living and inanimate things for\npurposes of applying 101, but between products of nature,\nwhether living or not, and human-made inventions. So,\nthere is no doubt that all categories of living things are\nwithin the interpretation of 101 that the Court adopted.\nAnd the anomaly of this case is that in\npetitioners' contention, the Court is being asked to\ndisfavor, for purposes of applying section 101, and\nindeed, to exclude from eligibility for section 101\nprotection the very subject matter for which Congress had\nshown special solicitude and saw a particular need for\npatent protection in these two acts at a time when it was\ndoubtful whether living things could get section 101\nprotection.\nQUESTION: Is there any -- anywhere have you\ncome across in your research any empirical estimate of how\nmany of the things that qualify under the two special acts\nmight also qualify under the Patent Act where you would\nhave to show it was nonobvious as well as new? Is there\nany guess? Did anybody ever make -- you know, in the\nGovernment have any idea on that?\nMR. WALLACE: Well, we do -- I can't give you\nany direct answer to that, but there -- there are certain\n-- there have been more plant variety certificates issued\nthan there have been utility patents issued on plants.\nThe --\nQUESTION: I noticed that there is a document\nfiled, which I got, that they referred to in the briefs.\nThis is Mr. Rifkin's report that went to Congress, and it\nmakes the recommendation I've referred to: no protection.\nThen it says backup documents will explain all the\nreasons. So, I've been trying to -- they're Government\nreports. I've been trying to find them. I can't. Does\nanyone know where they are? I'd like to read it, frankly.\nMR. WALLACE: We perhaps could provide some help\non that, but I cannot at the moment. I'll see what we can\ndo on that -- on that question.\nAs of September 30th of this year, the\nDepartment of Agriculture had issued 5,022 plant variety\ncertificates, whereas, as we explain in our brief, there\nhave been a total of 1,800 utility patents issued for\nplants or plant components such as seeds and the like.\nThe -- the PVPA protection, the Plant Variety\nProtection Act, is only on the plant variety itself so\nthat the availability of patents on seeds and other plant\nparts is available only under section 101.\nThe court in Chakrabarty itself said that\nnothing in the language or legislative history of the\nPlant Variety Protection Act indicated any intention to\nlimit section 101 availability for patents when the\nstandards of section 101 are met. And as a matter of\nfact, the relevant committee report on the PVPA in 1970,\nwhich we quote on page 22 in our brief in the middle of\nthe page, said quite specifically that that statute, the\nPVPA, quote, does not alter protection currently available\nwithin the patent system. So, we see no incompatibility\nbetween the two systems of protection.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wallace, can I ask you your view\non the question of whether a person who buys a patented\nseed and plants it and then gets some seeds and saves them\nand then replants them the following year, would he be an\ninfringer?\nMR. WALLACE: That depends on the terms of the\nlicense agreement. That -- that is within the -- the\npower of the patent holder to --\nQUESTION: Supposing the -- supposing the\nlicense agreement is -- is silent on the matter, but\nmerely identifies it as a patented seed.\nMR. WALLACE: Well, that -- to the -- you'd have\nto interpret what the arrangement is and what has been\ngranted and what has been withheld.\nQUESTION: The arrangement is that the -- the\nfarmer bought some seeds knowing they were patented.\nThat's the whole arrangement. Would he be -- would he\nviolate the terms of the patent and infringe the patent if\nhe saved the seeds?\nMR. WALLACE: If the -- if the plant could\nreproduce the same seeds that are patented, he could not\nmake and use the patented seeds without permission from\nthe license holder.\nThis license is not silent. It appears on page\n51 in the large appendix.\nQUESTION: Well, I know, but I'm not asking a\nquestion about the license.\nMR. WALLACE: Yes.\nQUESTION: I'm asking a question about the law.\nMR. WALLACE: Right, yes. And the license says\n-- I think this tells you something about the law. The\nlicense says it is granted solely to produce grain and/or\nforage, which could include any seeds that are produced.\nFor other licenses --\nQUESTION: Why is that not like a license to use\na patented mimeograph machine that's licensed only to use\nwith -- with the seller's paper? Why isn't that the same\nkind of thing?\nMR. WALLACE: Well, because your crop can be\nused as a means of producing patented seeds and\nreproducing the patented plant product, and it becomes a\nform of manufacturing of the patented item without the\npatent holder's permission unless arrangements have been\nmade.\nQUESTION: I -- I can't think of a machine that\ncan replicate itself. I've been trying to do that.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Now, maybe -- maybe that indicates\nthat plants are -- are different --\nMR. WALLACE: Well --\nQUESTION: -- and -- and that we should pay\ncareful attention before saying that the -- the new acts,\nthe 1930 act and the later act, were -- were not intended\nto supersede patent protection.\nMR. WALLACE: Well, plants are -- are different\nin that Congress, while saying that nothing was intended\nto limit section 101 availability, saw a special need to\nassure that for plants there would be protections\navailable even when it was doubtful, whether for\nmicroorganisms or animals, there would be. We now have --\nQUESTION: They also -- they also wanted to be\nsure that people could do research. You see, that's --\nthat's actually bothering me as much as the seeds. They\nwanted to be sure that people could do research, so they\ncreate a special exemption. And now your reading of the\npatent law will wipe out what sounds like a very important\nspecial exemption.\nMR. WALLACE: The exemption is for purposes of\nthat act only. When greater research and development,\ngreater disclosure, and higher standards for qualifying a\npatent have been met, there has been more of a\ncontribution to public knowledge which, under our\nintellectual property laws, justifies a greater exclusive\nright for a limited period of time.\nQUESTION: Which is why I wanted to know the\nempirical contours of that argument.\nMR. WALLACE: And then the public benefits from\nall of that. It's -- ultimately these intellectual\nproperty protections are for the benefit of the public.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wallace, what would it take to\ncraft a statute specifically designed for such living\nthings? When I read that sentence in Chakrabarty, I was a\nlittle puzzled because I said, well, why isn't this PVPA a\nstatute specifically designed for such living things?\nMR. WALLACE: It is to the extent it goes, but\nof course, it has a much less -- lower threshold of\nqualifying for eligibility and a lesser standard of\nprotections. The anomaly would be to say that the\nmicroorganism and animal patents issued under section 101\nshould have rights that are not available for those who\ninvent plants when it was plants that Congress wanted to\ngive special assurance for in -- in enacting this\nlegislation at a time when it was thought that, either for\npractical reasons or because of doubt about the\napplicability of --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Wallace.\nMR. WALLACE: -- all the plants, patents --\nQUESTION: Mr. Johnson, you have 10 seconds\nleft. We'll round it off and submit the case, and we'll\nall go to lunch.\nMR. JOHNSON: Whitman, section 119(f),\nCongress --\n"
