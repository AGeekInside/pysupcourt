        "content": "[11:05 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll now hear\nargument in Lincoln Property v. Roche.\nMr. Frederick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nThis is a routine diversity case that went\nseriously awry in the court of appeals. The\noriginal defendants in -- named in the complaint,\nPetitioners State of Wisconsin Investment Board,\nwhich I'll refer to as SWIB, and Lincoln Property\nCompany, are completely proper and diverse parties.\nSWIB owned the apartment complex, and Lincoln\nmanaged it through agents. The Fourth Circuit,\nnonetheless, embarked on a search for affiliates of\nLincoln that it thought would be more appropriate\nparty defendants, what the court deemed, quote,\n\"real parties in interest.\"\nThe Fourth Circuit's holdings are\nfundamentally flawed, in two respects. First,\nbecause the named defendants are proper parties, the\ncourt erred in holding that Lincoln had not carried\nits burden of proof by failing to establish that\nsome non-named putative defendants might possibly\ndestroy complete diversity, and that the remedy for\nsuch a possibility was dismissal of the action from\nFederal court. Second, the court erroneously\nengrafted a, quote, \"very close nexus\" requirement\nonto the test for require -- for determining the\ncitizenship of a limited partnership.\nNow, with respect to the first issue, a\nnumber of black-letter legal principles govern a\ncourt's consideration of non-named parties.\nLet's start with the statutory text. The\ndiversity statute, at section 1332(a), talks about\ncivil actions, and a \"civil action\" is defined as\nthe naming of a plaintiff and a defendant. A civil\naction does not encompass those that are not named\nin the lawsuit. That language is tracked in the\nremoval statute, section 1441(a), which also speaks\nof civil actions, and in -- mirrored in 1441(b),\nwhich says that a defendant may remove, where it is\nproperly joined and served.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I thought (b)\nsimply enacted a special necessary condition when\nyou had a local defendant. I thought it was not an\neligibility provision. I thought it was a\nlimitation provision.\nMR. FREDERICK: It is, Justice Souter, but\nwhat -- my argument is that that language, properly\njoined and served, simply tracks the civil-action\nrequirement under the original diversity statute, as\nwell as the removal provision of 1441(a). But what\nthe court --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's consistent\nwith it, but I -- it seems to me that it's a bit of\na stretch to say that anyone who is properly joined\nand served, at least in a formal sense, is,\ntherefore, the only person who may be considered in\na -- in a diversity inquiry.\nMR. FREDERICK: What the court of appeals\ndid, and where we think it got off track, was it\ntook the -- to -- the phrase \"parties in interest,\"\nand it -- and it took cases from this Court that\nhave used the phrase \"real parties in interest\" to\ndetermine what are proper party plaintiffs, and it\nused that concept on the defendant's side of the\nledger. And none of the cases from this Court talk\nabout \"real parties in interest\" as being\ndefendants. The explanation given by the court for\ndoing it on the plaintiff's side is to ensure that a\ndefendant is not going to be subjected to multiple\nsuits. But there are many purposes --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, I take it your\nanswer to Justice Souter is yes. In other words, if\nthe mistake that the court made was relying on\n1441(b), it was a similar mistake for you, in your\nopening brief, to put such weight on that language\nin 1441(b).\nMR. FREDERICK: Our position, Your Honor,\nis that the phrase \"parties in interest\" -- we were\nseeking to find out where the court could have\napplied that phraseology on the defendant's side.\nAnd the only place that we could find, in the\nstatutes or the rules, was in 1441(b) and the\nexplanation for removal, that we were not a \"proper\nparty in interest.\" And that's why we focused on that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, what\nabout cases where a plaintiff sues two defendants --\none is diverse, and the other is not diverse -- and\nthere is a motion by the defendants to dismiss for\nwant of diversity? The plaintiff then says, \"Oh,\nbut only one of those defendants is the 'real-party\nwhatever,' and I can drop the other one, because the\nother one is not the 'real party in interest'\"?\nNow, that's a situation where courts, even if this\ncourt has never had that problem, have said, \"If the\nsecond defendant, the non-diverse defendant, is a\n'real party,' you can't get rid of the case that\nway, but if it's not -- if it's not, you can keep\nthe -- just drop it and keep the case going against\nthe 'real party in interest.'\" There are such\ncases.\nMR. FREDERICK: There are, Justice\nGinsburg. And the analysis goes to whether or not -\n- how far along in the proceeding the litigation has\noccurred before the plaintiff makes that choice. Of\ncourse, a plaintiff can voluntarily drop defendants,\nwithout any consequences, and the courts have fairly\nuniformly held that it -- that it is no\njurisdictional bar for a plaintiff to drop a non-\ndiverse defendant in order to ensure that diversity\nwould be present. Had this complaint been brought\nin Federal court, there is no doubt that the court\nwould have had original jurisdiction, because, on\nthe face of the complaint, the two named defendants\nwere completely diverse.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ah, but the plaintiff\nsaid, \"This is a complicated real estate business,\nand I want to discover whether there is -- whether\nthe 'true defendant' is a Virginia citizen, as I\nam.\" So, on the face of it, it looks like there's\ncomplete diversity, but, in fact, the diverse\ndefendant is hiding the \"real party.\" I think\nthat's the position that the plaintiff was taking.\nMR. FREDERICK: And that position is\nincorrect, both as a factual matter and as a legal\nmatter. As a factual matter, Lincoln is a\ncompletely proper party. Its name is on the lease.\nIt was the employer of Mr. Roche, who was one of\nthe plaintiffs in the suit. It issued the mold\npolicies that are at issue in the case. All of its\nadvertising is alleged to have been fraudulent in\nthe original complaint. And it was the director and\nmanager of the agents whose acts were alleged to\nhave been negligent here. There's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The plaintiff --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- no question --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the plaintiff points\nto two offices of the defendant, who's -- the\ndefendant is described by defendant as a Texas\ncorporation -- but there was one witness -- Chaney,\nwas it? -- who said that Lincoln is not a\ncorporation. It is a partnership. No corporate\nboard.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, Mr. Chaney's\ntestimony has to be viewed in contact -- in context,\nJustice Ginsburg. He was not called as a 30(b)(6)\nwitness as a corporate -- for a corporate form and\nstructure. The testimony that was being elicited\nwas to see whether Lincoln had other entities and\nownership of properties in Virginia so that they\ncould attempt to prove that there was a problem that\nthe parent company, Lincoln Property Company, knew\nabout. There was a high degree of imprecision in\nthe deposition questions, and it's fairly clear, I\nthink, that the lawyer and the witness did not\nunderstand what each other were talking about. Yet\nin the discovery process, not a single question was\npresented that would get at the organizational\nstructure of Lincoln. There was not any attempt to\nget behind the management documents between SWIB and\nLincoln Property. It was one very small snippet of\na deposition which has been taken out of context\nand, we would submit, blown out of proportion by the\nRespondents in their submissions in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they thought they\ngot closer with a witness named Franzen, who was a\nVirginia resident, and who also described Lincoln as\na partnership, and himself as a partner.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Ginsburg, as\nthe Real Estate Roundtable brief demonstrates, and\nis unrebutted, the real-estate industry operates\nthrough many very complicated structures for\nperfectly legitimate finance and tax-related\nreasons. And Mr. Franzen is a partner in some\ndeals, but the testimony that was provided in a\ndeclaration -- and it is appended to our reply brief\n-- demonstrates that Mr. Franzen was not a partner\nin any deal that had anything to do with the\nWestfield Village Apartments.\nBut what the court of appeals did was, it\nerected a burden of proof that said that the\ndefendant has to prove a negative, that there is not\nsome affiliate corporation out there that is a\ncitizen of the Commonwealth that would be existing\nto destroy diversity. And that type of burden, to\nprove a negative, has never been authorized in this\nCourt's cases. Rather, what this Court's cases have\nheld is that, as the masters of their complaint,\nplaintiffs have an opportunity to plead whichever\ndefendants they want to try to prove their\nallegations against. If they want to try to prove\nFederal claims, this Court has held that that kind\nof case can be removed. If it wants to plead around\nFederal claims, this Court's cases have said that\nthat would be respected, as well.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Frederick,\nearlier you made the point that Lincoln was a proper\n\"real party in interest.\" I take it that's not\ncritical to your position. Your argument would be\nthe same if they weren't a real party in interest,\nwouldn't it?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, we don't think,\nJustice -- Mr. Chief Justice, that the \"real party\nin interest\" analysis even applies on the\ndefendant's side, but it is -- it would not apply\nto this extent. It's not for the courts, once they\nhave a proper defendant, to be searching outside the\nrecord for possible jurisdictional spoilers once\njurisdiction has been established. And this court's\ncases --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if they -- if\nthey don't have a proper defendant, they should do\nthat?\nMR. FREDERICK: If they do -- if there is\nno proper defendant, then I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I presume, then --\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct. It --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that the\nplaintiff loses, not that you get to have the court\nfind the proper defendant for the plaintiff.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct. It would\nbe a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, where there is no\ndefendant who would be liable to the plaintiff.\nBut what the court of appeals did here\nwas, it imposed an obligation on the defendants\nthat, in effect, confuses the obligations that are\nin Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19, which looks\nat whether there are necessary or indispensable\nparties. And what the court did was, in effect, to\ntake an unnamed affiliated entity to Lincoln and\ntreat it as the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- functional equivalent\nof an --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- will you just clarify\none thing for me? Did the defendant ever take the\nposition in this litigation, in discovery or\nanywhere along the line, that they sued their own\ndefendant?\nMR. FREDERICK: No. In fact, in their\nanswer, Justice Stevens, they admitted that they\nwere the manager of the apartment, that they had run\nit through their agents. They acknowledged that it\nwas their policies that were in effect. There\nwouldn't have been a basis that would have survived\nrule 11 that would have given Lincoln Property\nCompany a basis on which not to defend the lawsuit.\nAnd so, to that extent, we think it's quite clear\nthat they are a proper party defendant.\nWe've always taken the position that if we\nare found liable, we would pay a judgment. The\nissue is that we don't think we're liable, because\nwe think that the allegations in the complaint are\ncompletely baseless. And that's what the district\ncourt found when it held, on summary judgment, that\nthere was not a dispute of fact as to the core\nallegations of the complaint.\nReturning to the point I was trying to\nmake about rule 19, there is a mechanism for the\ncourts to consider whether there are indispensable\nparties. And what the court did here was to take a\nrule 19 kind of inquiry -- Is a non-named defendant\nreally an indispensable party, such that dismissal\nof the action is warranted? -- and to engraft that\nonto a jurisdictional inquiry. But the reason why\nwe have the Rules of Civil Procedure is, of course,\nto follow them. And what the Fourth Circuit did\nhere was, it took that kind of analysis, but it\ndidn't follow the standards that the courts have set\nout for applying rule 19 properly.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, plaintiff\ncertainly wouldn't want to say there's an\nindispensable party missing, I take it, because then\nthat would put the plaintiff out of court. The\nplaintiff is arguing that there's another defendant\nwho should be in here.\nMR. FREDERICK: And, Justice Ginsburg,\nthey never sought to name or join that other\npossible defendant. They never brought a joinder\nmotion. They never even conducted discovery as to\nwhether or not there was another possible defendant\nthat might be affiliated. And their theory of\nliability made it unnecessary, because their theory\nof liability was that Lincoln Property Company, the\nparent, is responsible for all the acts of its\nagents. And had they really wanted to be in Federal\ncourt, they could have found plenty of Virginia\ncitizens that they could have sued. They could have\nsued the plumber, they could have sued the installer\nof a -- heating and air-conditioning equipment, they\ncould have sued the general contractors. There are\na lot of people they could have sued if they were\nthat intent on staying in Federal court. But,\ninstead, they made a tactical choice to sue the\ndeepest pockets. And the deepest pockets happened\nto be out-of-State citizens that have a right under\nthe statutes to remove the case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And because you\nrepresent the removing defendant, it is true, is it\nnot, that the removing defendant has the burden of\nshowing that proper diversity exists?\nMR. FREDERICK: And we readily satisfied\nthat, both on the face of the complaint, which\nidentified Lincoln Property Company as a Texas\ncorporation, and in the remand notice, which\nidentified its principal place of business as Texas.\nEven the court of appeals had no problem calling it\na \"Texas parent,\" because the corporation documents,\nwhich are part of the record, amply demonstrated\nthat Lincoln Property Company is, in fact, a Texas\ncorporation and satisfies those requisites under the\ndiversity jurisdiction provision.\nThe -- instead, what the Fourth Circuit\nhas done is to erect a standardless forum that will\nincrease litigation over jurisdiction by inviting\ncourts to make inquiry about parties and entities\nthat are not named in the lawsuit, solely for the\npurpose of determining whether or not there are\njurisdictional spoilers.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- I know you\ncontend that's not the case, but let's say there is\na in-State subsidiary that's completely responsible\nfor all the challenged actions, and the in-State\nplaintiff sues an -- only the out-of-State parent.\nWhat happens in that case?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, what the ninth\ncircuit, in a -- in an opinion by then-Judge Kennedy\nthat we have cited, called Simpson -- said you\nrespect the plaintiff's allegations. If the\nplaintiff wants to sue the parent, and the parent is\nan out-of-State corporation, the plaintiff is the\nmaster of the complaint. And, in the Simpson case,\nthe Ninth Circuit held that it was completely proper\nto remain in Federal court, even though it was\nobvious to all that there was a subsidiary that was\nan in-State subsidiary that, if it had been sued,\nwould be non-diverse. So, we think that's the\nproper answer, Mr. Chief Justice.\nNow, if I could turn to the second issue\nthat we have prevented -- presented, that concerns\nhow one would treat EQR, which is the management\nagent of Lincoln Property Company. We read the\nFourth Circuit's opinion as engrafting onto this\nCourt's test in the Carden case an additional\nrequirement that, in addition to the citizens of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, would\nyou clarify one thing for me? I don't know how we\neven get to the second question, about partnership.\nIf you're right that Lincoln is a corporation --\nit's a Texas corporation, with its principal place\nof business in Texas, end of case; it's the only\nnamed defendant -- so, how do we get to something\nabout a partnership?\nMR. FREDERICK: If you agree with us on\nquestion one, Justice Ginsburg, reversal is the\nappropriate disposition, and the Court need not\nreach question two.\nWe would submit, however, that, because\nthe error is so egregious and leads to the\ndifficulties that have been outlined by the Real\nEstate Roundtable for nationwide business entities,\nthat the Court certainly ought to say that this was\nerror, as well, or at least to vacate that part of\nthe judgment, as well. And the reason is, in the\nCarden case, what the Court held was that the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I don't\nunderstand it. We wouldn't vacate the judgment in\npart. If we reversed, --\nMR. FREDERICK: No, but you --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that's the end of\nit.\nMR. FREDERICK: -- expressed disapproval\nwith this very-close-nexus standard by which the\nFourth Circuit attempted to engraft onto the normal\ncitizenship rules for a limited partnership the\nnotion that its citizenship could be deemed, if its\nactivities had a very close nexus with the State --\nand I'm referring now to the passage, Justice\nGinsburg, that's at pages 16(a) to 17(a) of the\npetition appendix. There are four page -- four\nsentences on those two pages that capture the error\nof the Fourth Circuit. And, just below the bottom,\nit says -- it says, \"The real party in interest owns\nland and operates a substantial part of its business\nin Virginia, thus establishing a very close nexus\nwith the Commonwealth.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but, Mr.\nFrederick, before that -- you know, read back -- the\ncourt -- the Fourth Circuit has said, \"It appears\nthat the real and substantial party in interest is\nthis Virginia subsidiary, be it a partnership, be it\na corporation.\"\nSo, it's -- the thing about nexus is not\nself-standing. The court is positing that there is\na Virginia corporation or a Virginia partnership in\nthe picture, and then says, \"And given that, not\nonly is it -- is it a Virginia entity, but it's got\nthis close nexus because of -- it's operating\nsubstantially there, as well.\"\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, all of the evidence,\nJustice Ginsburg, in the record was that EQR was a\nDelaware limited partnership, where it was\nregistered, composed of a Texas corporation as its\ngeneral partner, and a limited partner that had two\npartners that were, themselves, Texas corporations.\nSo, the evidence in the record established that\nEQR, which was the entity the Fourth Circuit was\nalluding to here, was, in fact, a Texas citizen, and\nits attempt to confuse the record by suggesting that\nthere was a way to look at the citizenship of that\nentity through its, quote, \"very close nexus with\nthe State,\" we submit, is also in error.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct, though,\nthis entity we're talking about is not a party to\nthe case?\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So --\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct, Justice\nStevens, and that's where we think that the Fourth\nCircuit went off.\nI'd just like to make one more point\nbefore saving the remainder of my time for rebuttal,\nand that is that if the Fourth Circuit was correct,\nSWIB is a critical party here, which the respondents\nnever deny. It is the owner of the apartment\nbuilding. It is a completely proper defendant for\nthe acts of negligence in -- and other wrongdoings\nthat they allege. But they never mention that party\nin their brief. So, if the Fourth Circuit is\ncorrect that Lincoln, the parent, really is nominal\nunder this Court's decisions, its citizenship should\nbe completely disregarded. That was the holding of\nthis Court in Walden versus Skinner in 1879. On the\nother hand, if a Lincoln affiliate at that stage in\nthe litigation is a proper defendant, but non-\ndiverse, the Fourth Circuit should have dismissed\nit, under Horn versus Lockhart, which was decided in\n1873.\nIf the Court has no further questions,\nthank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nFrederick.\nMr. Joseph.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY P. JOSEPH\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. JOSEPH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe judgment of the Fourth Circuit should\nbe affirmed for two reasons, one of which responds\nto a question that the Chief Justice asked, and that\nis that Lincoln Property Company was not a real\nparty to the controversy.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was what?\nMR. JOSEPH: Was not a real party to the\ncontroversy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why did you name\nit, in the complaint, as the defendant?\nMR. JOSEPH: Trial counsel named it,\nbecause that was the understanding that he had. It\nturned out, as Lincoln proved on remand, that it had\nabandoned the apartment management business in 1991.\nAnd that's at page 239 of the joint appendix.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you'll be left\nwithout -- if you've named the wrong defendant,\nthen you have a suit against no defendant. It seems\nto me you are automatically dismissed. You didn't\nsubstitute another defendant.\nMR. JOSEPH: You're correct, Your Honor,\nand that's because Lincoln said that it was the\nmanager. Lincoln, in its answer, paragraphs 13,\nparagraph 36, paragraph 5, said that it was the real\nparty in interest, when, in fact, it was not. And\nthat's what's led to the problem that we find\nourselves in, because when you have a non-real party\nto the controversy, jurisdiction is determined by\nthe salient jurisdictional --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I've never heard of that.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought, if you sue A,\nand then it turns out A doesn't own the building,\nwell, then you've got to sue B.\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, that is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you didn't sue B.\nMR. JOSEPH: We didn't sue B. We didn't\nknow B existed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's too bad,\nthat, unfortunately, if you don't know who owns the\nbuilding, it's going to be hard for you to bring the\nlawsuit. But we had, I thought, like, pages and\npages of discovery rules and -- I've never heard,\nbefore, of a lawyer who has a -- you know, in this\nkind of situation, can't find out who owns a\nbuilding there. There are records, there are all\nkinds of things.\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, Lincoln\nrepresented to the public and to the court that it\nwas, in fact, the manager. Discovery was, in fact,\nserved that would have adduced this information.\nThis issue came up in the reply brief, so it's not\naddressed in our brief, but if any of your clerks\nwould care to look at the Fourth Circuit's\nsupplemental appendix, it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I've looked through the\nappendix, actually. I read the joint appendix,\ninsofar as the opinion cited it. And it cited, in\nthe opinion, several -- five factors -- and I guess\nthere are no others, though you can bring them out\nif there were -- that supported you. And the only\ntwo that seemed to say that it had something to do -\n- that seemed to have anything at all to do with\nsuggesting that there was no diversity -- was Mr.\nFred Chaney, which said that it was a partnership\nand not a company. I read that. That didn't seem\nto me to be what he said. And then somebody called\nMr. LeBeau, who said that Franzen is a senior vice\npresident and -- a Virginia resident -- and partner\nin Lincoln Property. So, I looked up that, and it\nwas on, like, page 273 and, I think, 173 there. And\nthey asked Mr. LeBeau, and he says, \"Lincoln\noperates through many different structures, and I\ndon't know what they were using here.\" Am I right -\n-\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- or did I misread it?\nMR. JOSEPH: -- you read that absolutely\ncorrectly. There --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So --\nMR. JOSEPH: -- are other --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- what is the evidence?\nMR. JOSEPH: There are -- there is other\nevidence on that issue, which I believe is a\ndistinct issue, but let me address that issue. In\nlawyer-prepared documents that were submitted\nspecifically to rule 26(a)(1) disclosures and the --\nand the supplemental interrogatory answers, which\nwe've cited in our brief, it was lawyers that\nidentified Mr. Franzen as a senior vice president\nand partner of Lincoln Property Company, raising an\nissue --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where is it in the\nappendix? It said that he -- you sue person X, and\nI take it the reason that you won this case in the\nFourth Circuit -- which was surprising to me -- was\nthat a person called Mr. Franzen, who is a resident\nof Virginia, was a partner of the defendant. Now, I\nwould like -- and, indeed, it was a partnership of\nwhich he was a partner. So, if a Virginia resident\nis a partner of the defendant, which is a\npartnership, then maybe you were right.\nSo, I'm interested in: What is the\nevidence that Mr. Franzen was a partner of the\ndefendant, which is a partnership?\nMR. JOSEPH: On page 179 of the joint\nappendix, Your Honor, in Lincoln's supplemental\nanswers to interrogatories, Mr. Franzen is\nidentified in this affirmation as a senior vice\npresident and partner of Lincoln Property Company.\nAs I said, there are two issues. What is Lincoln's\ncharacterization?\nOn the next page, page 181, in the\nsupplemental initial disclosures, Mr. Franzen is\nagain, in the middle of the page, identified as a\npartner of Lincoln Property Company.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What page --\nMR. JOSEPH: I'm sorry, that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is that? Is that a --\nMR. JOSEPH: -- that was joint appendix,\npage 181.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's better than\nwhat is in the opinion. What is it? 181.\nMR. JOSEPH: 181, Your Honor. The prior\none was 179. There was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And how about joint\nappendix 239 and 275, both of which say that Franzen\nwas not a partner in any entity responsible for\nmanaging the apartments in question?\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, that evidence was\nalso in the record. The Fourth Circuit was not\ncomfortable that Mr. Franzen was being entirely\ncandid by not identifying which partnerships, in\nfact, he was involved in. And I would note, Your\nHonor, that this paragraph does not identify any\nentity that actually managed the apartment building.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Mr. Joseph, I --\nMR. JOSEPH: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- I thought we had to\ndecide whether an unnamed private party should be\nconsidered for jurisdictional purposes.\nMR. JOSEPH: Correct.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And do you have any\ncase supporting that proposition?\nMR. JOSEPH: Yes, Your Honor. I'd cite\ntwo cases, in particular, for a real-party-to-the-\ncontroversy defendant, where his citizenship is\ndisregarded, even though he's named: Barney versus\nCity of Baltimore, 73 U.S. 580, and Little against\nGiles, 118 U.S. 596.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- it sounds to\nme -- if I understood your answer correctly, you're\ntalking about cases in which the named party\ncitizenship is disregarded.\nMR. JOSEPH: Correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Where the question is,\nShould an unnamed party citizenship \"be\" regarded?\nMR. JOSEPH: Absolutely, Your Honor. And\nthat is the issue that we find in the Fourth\nCircuit. The Fourth Circuit found that Lincoln\nProperty Company was a nominal defendant.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then there's no\ndefendant.\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, they defended the\ncase. And we'd submit that, on the basis of Barney\nand Little, that what one does -- on the basis of\nthe State Highway Commission case, when you have\nsomeone who is serving as a surrogate for another,\nyou look to the jurisdictional characteristics of\nthe other; otherwise, he can, by coming in to\ndefend, obtain a Federal forum to which he is\notherwise not entitled.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but he didn't come\nin to defend; you pulled him in to defend.\nMR. JOSEPH: It --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the problem that I\nhave with your position is, I don't know of anything\nin the record that indicates that he wasn't ready to\ndefend, that he wouldn't have -- or it wasn't ready\nto defend, that it wouldn't have paid the judgment,\nthat you could have -- could not have gotten, from\nthe party you named, all the relief that you were\nasking for.\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, it was definitely\na party to the controversy. We believe that the\npoint of the \"real party to the controversy\"\ndoctrine is that every party doesn't fall in that\ncategory, and that is what the focus --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But so far as the\nFourth Circuit -- tell me if I'm wrong here -- it\nsounds to me that the Fourth Circuit took the\nfollowing position, that for purposes of determining\ndiversity, it is not enough to name a principal who\nmay be liable for the acts of subsidiaries, without\nnaming the subsidiary, or, if you name a -- I'm\nmixing up principal and corporation --\nMR. JOSEPH: Understood.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- principal and --\ncorporate parent and subsidiary, or principal and\nbusiness agent. And I don't know of any rule to the\neffect that, for diversity purposes, a plaintiff\nsimply cannot choose to sue the parent, or to sue\nthe principal.\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, the facts, as\nyou've stated them, I believe, are not the facts in\nthis record.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Where would I be\nwrong?\nMR. JOSEPH: And let me explain. It's\ncertainly true that Lincoln identifies, at page 96\nof the cert petition appendix, a chart of entities\nthat are salient. The most notable omission from\nthe chart is the relationship of any of those\nentities to Lincoln. There is no evidence as to\nwhat -- how attenuated that was or what the\nrelationship is, what indemnities existed, or\nwhether Lincoln actually had an interest in this\noutcome. They now rely on an agency theory. That\nisn't how the case was defended.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you named Lincoln\nas the defendant. And I'm looking at your second\namended complaint, which says, \"Lincoln,\" on\ninformation and belief, \"is a corporation with its\nheadquarters in Dallas, and it is the developer and\nmanager of the property.\" That's what you alleged\nin your complaint. You allege that Lincoln was the\nmanager -- Lincoln, whose Texas corporation was the\nmanager of the property in question. Now, would you\n-- you're saying that that was wrong, and you should\nhave sued somebody else, and the Court should cure\nthat for you? That's -- it's really bizarre.\nMR. JOSEPH: Well, let me try to make it\nless bizarre, Your Honor. What we're saying is, for\nexample, if I had a dispute with John Smith, the\nson, who's not diverse, but I accidentally sue John\nSmith, the father, who is diverse, and he comes in -\n- he removes, and he comes in to defend, on the\nmerits, that he is not a real party to that\ncontroversy, and that his citizenship, under the\nopinions of this Court, would be measured by that of\nthe son to determine whether or not a Federal forum\nis appropriate --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's a real party if you\nsued him.\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just because you're going\nto lose doesn't mean that he's not a real party.\nMR. JOSEPH: It's one thing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me anybody\nyou sue is a real party.\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, that cannot be\nthe case, or the \"real party to the controversy\"\ncase means that every defendant is a real party.\nAnd it's true, in this sense, that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they -- let me stop\nyou on that \"real party,\" because, as has been\npointed out, the \"real party in interest\" concept,\nas a procedural matter, comes out of rule 17, and\nit's talking about plaintiffs, that suits have to be\nbrought in the name of the real party so that the\ndefendant isn't in a situation where he's sued one\nday by plaintiff A, and is not home free when\nplaintiff B comes in with the identical complaint.\nSo, it was originally designed with, Who is the\nproper party, the assignee or the assignor? That's\nwhat real party -- that's what the concept is\nfamiliarly about. Who is the proper plaintiff, not\ndefendant?\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, it's certainly\ntrue that rule 17 only deals with plaintiffs. But\nin the cases we've cited, including two I just cited\ntoday, it applies to defendants, as well, because\nrule 17 doesn't confine the limits. In Navarro, the\nCourt said that it articulates the same principles,\nbut it's not completely congruent with the \"real\nparty to the controversy\" test.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Rule 17 is about\njoinder of parties; it's not about jurisdiction.\nMR. JOSEPH: Exactly right. And we're\ntalking about the jurisdiction of the court under\nthe \"real party to the controversy\" test.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, that's -- it's\nsomething different. It's a -- it's a whole other\nanimal, because \"real party in interest,\" as used in\nthe Federal rules, is a device -- is a joinder\ndevice, is in the joinder rules. Now you're saying,\n\"Ah, but there's some other real-party concept out\nthere that has to do with jurisdiction.\"\nMR. JOSEPH: Yes, Your Honor. And I\nbelieve the Court's opinion, in Carden, identified\n\"real party to the controversy\" doctrine in a recent\nexample. I believe it was mentioned again in the\nGrupo Dataflux opinion. The concept is that the\nreal parties to the controversy must be before the\ncourt.\nAnd to respond to Justice Scalia's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Carden was\nabout: In a partnership, does every partner's\ncitizenship count?\nMR. JOSEPH: Correct. And in -- it\nidentified --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There wasn't any\nquestion that -- that it was the right or the --\nthat the defendant was a wrong defendant or that --\nMR. JOSEPH: The language I'm referring\nto, in Carden, was in distinguishing the dissenting\nopinion, in saying that if, in fact, the question\nwere, Which of the parties before the court should\nbe considered, for jurisdictional purposes? it would\nbe the real parties to the controversy.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But to get the real\nparties before the court, you have to sue them.\nMR. JOSEPH: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And, apparently, you\ndidn't sue the right people until you replied to me.\nThen I took your argument, because it seemed like\nseven arguments, mixed up, and I took that argument\nto be the following. I'm -- I, the plaintiff, sued\na defendant, who is called the Lincoln Property\nCompany. Now, I grant you, there is some evidence\nthat that defendant, the one I sued, is a Texas\ncorporation. One, they showed us the certificate of\nincorporation, or they got a sworn statement. Two,\nin my complaint, I said that's what he was.\nHowever, there is some evidence the other\nway. On page 179 and 181, we have a person named\nMr. Franzen who says, \"I am the senior president, vice\npresident, partner for defendant Lincoln Property\nCompany,\" in which case, if that's your argument,\nyou're telling us -- is that your argument, that\nthere is some evidence the real defendant, whom I\nsued, is not a corporation, despite the apparent\nevidence to the contrary?\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Rather, it is a partner,\nand Mr. Franzen is a partner in it. Is that your\nargument?\nMR. JOSEPH: We did argue, and we do\nargue, that the Fourth Circuit could reasonably\nconclude, on burden-of-proof grounds, that it was\nnot satisfied that the Texas corporation was a\ncorporate entity. But the argument that I've been\nusing --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to make that\nargument here, or are you going to give up on that\nargument?\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, we're not\nabandoning the argument, only because if you look at\nthe corporate entity, itself, from the joint\nappendix, 243, it began as Lincoln Property number\none. If we then look at the yellow brief, in the\naddendum, we have thousands of Lincoln entities. We\nhave no doubt there is a corporation that is a Texas\nentity.\nNow, our argument today is that that\nentity could not step in the shoes of another\npotentially non-diverse entity without at least\nidentifying who the -- what the jurisdictional\ncharacteristics of that entity were. Agency was not\nargued. Agency was not argued below. Lincoln said\nit was the manager. The district court found, in\nthree opinions, Lincoln was the manager. The\nplaintiffs thought they were suing the entity\nmanaging the premises. Lincoln was not that entity.\nIt had abandoned that business.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if they said they\nwere, then it seems to me -- why don't you just hold\nthem to it?\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, it was not the\nplaintiff's choice.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it seems very odd\nthat they -- they say, \"We were,\" and you say, \"Oh,\nno, you weren't.\"\n[Laughter.]\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"We shouldn't have sued\nyou.\" Why don't you just take them at their word\nand sue them?\nMR. JOSEPH: There were significant\ntactical advantages to Lincoln, whatever its\nrelationship with these entities, in being in\nFederal court. The plaintiff preferred a State-\ncourt venue where there was no Daubert and there was\nno summary judgment permissible on the basis of\naffidavits and deposition testimony.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But it isn't up to the\ncourt of appeals to make some kind of roving inquiry\nof who would have been a better defendant. It just\nseems to me the Fourth Circuit rule is totally\nunworkable and unprecedented. I don't see how you\ncan possibly overcome that, because the plaintiff is\nthe master of its complaint, and it can decide who\nto sue. And Lincoln was sued as a corporation, and\nI don't see what business it is of a court to say,\n\"Oh, it should have been somebody else.\"\nMR. JOSEPH: Let me attempt to articulate\na proposition, Your Honor, and that is that when\njurisdiction is challenged, the party asserting\njurisdiction, seeking the Federal forum, has to\ndefend it by proving diversity of citizenship, and\nthat means when its \"real party to the controversy\"\nstatus is challenged, it has to adduce sufficient\nevidence that it is, indeed, the real party to the\ncontroversy.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, you can move, as\na party to the case, to dismiss somebody who's sued\nfor some reason, but that isn't what happened here.\nMR. JOSEPH: It is not what happened here.\nAnd I would submit to you it is not what happened\nhere, because of a lack of candor on the part of the\ndefendant. Ordinarily, one would expect the\ndefendant to say, \"Not me.\" In fact, this defendant\nproceeded to litigate --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what if they did?\nSuppose they did say, \"Not me,\" and you proceeded\nwith your lawsuit.\nMR. JOSEPH: They'd --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay? What would happen?\nMR. JOSEPH: Your --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They would win the\njudgment. Would they be the real party in that\ncontroversy?\nMR. JOSEPH: And that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course they would be.\nBecause you sued them. Even if they're innocent --\nare you saying all innocent parties are not parties\nto the controversy?\nMR. JOSEPH: By no means --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think so.\nMR. JOSEPH: -- Your Honor. And that was\n-- that was a part of your first question, which I\nwant to respond to. Anybody who is a non-real party\nto the controversy finds jurisdiction in the Federal\ncourt to be able to establish that it is not the\nparty. But when it defends, by standing in the\nshoes as a surrogate for another in order to obtain\na Federal forum, the jurisdictional characteristics\nof that party are not germane. It is the\njurisdictional characteristics of the party in whose\nshoes it stands.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we don't know --\nMR. JOSEPH: That is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- who that party is.\nLet's go back to your -- when you started\nthis case, you said that you would, on discovery --\nthis is what you said in -- at the time of your\ninitial complaint -- determine if there is an\nadditional defendant, or defendants, who should be\nnamed as parties. What discovery did you pursue to\nfind out if there was an additional defendant, or\ndefendants, who should be named as parties?\nMR. JOSEPH: Interrogatory number 3 in the\nFourth Circuit supplemental appendix, at page 35,\ninquires about any person, which is defined to\ninclude any corporate affiliate, that has any\nknowledge of the tenancy of the plaintiffs. The\nobjections are not in the record. Again, this\nissue came up in the yellow brief, but they did not\nreply to that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Has any knowledge of --\nMR. JOSEPH: Documents --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the what of --\nMR. JOSEPH: Of the tenancy of the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.\nMR. JOSEPH: -- lease relationship of the\nRoches in the Westfield Village Apartment --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Joseph, can I ask\nyou to go back to the beginning for a second?\nMR. JOSEPH: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They filed a reply\nbrief. There are a lot of disputes about the facts.\nDo you concede that the Lincoln Property Company\nthat you sued is a Texas corporation?\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, we acknowledge\nthere is a Texas corporation. We sued the Texas --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you acknowledge that\nthe corporation that you sued, Lincoln Property\nCompany, is a Texas corporation?\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, we do not, in the\nsense that we accept the Fourth Circuit's\ndetermination that the burden of proof to clarify\nthat entity's status, and the germane entity status\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understood them to be\narguing, in essence, that there's some other entity\nthat really is the real party in interest.\nMR. JOSEPH: That is correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you dispute, as a\nmatter of fact, that Lincoln Property Company is a\nTexas corporation?\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, what we say is\nthat the Fourth Circuit found that there was\ninsufficient --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm asking you a --\nMR. JOSEPH: -- proof of that point.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- very simple \"yes\" or\n\"no\" question.\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, we do not -- we\ndo not walk away from the Fourth Circuit's\nconclusion, so we -- we know there is a Texas\ncorporation. We don't know that that is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is this corporation a\nTexas corporation? The one you sued.\nMR. JOSEPH: We so alleged, and they said\nyes. So --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So, you say yes, it is.\nMR. JOSEPH: It is. But whether or not\nthat is the entity, we can't be sure of, because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'd like the -- these\nare very expensive, this litigation. You're all the\nway in the Supreme Court. It's costing people a lot\nof money. And if there is a legal issue here, I'd\nlike to find out what it is.\nI have exactly the same question Justice\nStevens had, which is where I started. Do you agree\nthat the company you sued, called Lincoln Property,\nis a Texas corporation, yes or no?\nMR. JOSEPH: Yes, Your Honor, we'll --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. JOSEPH: -- acknowledge that for this\nargument.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then that's out -- fine,\nthat's out of the case.\nThe next question is -- of course you\ncould sue a real company, called Lincoln Property or\nJolly Fisherman, and it could turn out that that\nreal company is a front, that it has no real\nexistence, its -- all its papers and everything to\ndo with it is signed by a totally separate\ncorporation. Are you saying that's what happened\nhere? And if that's what happened here, which is\nthe real corporation and people in interest?\nMR. JOSEPH: It is -- the burden-of-proof\nfailure that the Fourth Circuit found was that we\ncould not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not talking about\nburden-of-proof failure.\nMR. JOSEPH: We don't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm asking you, Who is\nthe real corporation or person in interest that\nLincoln Property is a kind of sham or front for?\nMR. JOSEPH: We do not have the answer to\nthat question. And that was the Fourth Circuit's\nconclusion. We know that EQR is a part of that.\nAnd that's why -- they put in an affidavit that said\nthat EQR was the only affiliate of Lincoln involved\nin the management --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then you think --\nMR. JOSEPH: -- and that's why we --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm getting there. I'm\nnot arguing with you. I'm getting there. Then you\nthink that whoever it is that they are the front for\nhas -- is a Virginia resident. Is that what you\nthink?\nMR. JOSEPH: What we think, Your Honor, is\nthat they did not prove that that was not the case,\nand the burden of proof to sustain jurisdiction was\ntheirs.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Might be a Virginia\nresident.\nMR. JOSEPH: Correct. We don't know --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Might be.\nMR. JOSEPH: -- who it is.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You think there is a real\nparty there that might be a Virginia resident. And\ndo you have any idea whatsoever of what that real\nparty is called?\nMR. JOSEPH: We do not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what's the evidence\nthat there is a Virginia resident, in there?\nMR. JOSEPH: That is the burden-of-proof\nfailure that the Fourth Circuit found. But the Real\nEstate Roundtable brief, at page 11, identifies the\nfact that it's very common to have a special-purpose\nentity that is property-specific, which gives\nfurther rise to that inference. But it is a failure\nof a burden of proof that was ultimately found by\nthe Fourth Circuit. And because of the failure of\nthe burden of proof, we're not in a position to\nidentify the party. Had --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the failure of the\nburden of proof is apparently a function of the\nFourth Circuit's assumption that if you sue the\nparent, you have a duty to negate the possibility of\nsuing any subsidiary; or if you sue the principal,\nyou have an obligation to negate the possibility of\nsuing any agent. And I don't see where that comes,\nexcept out of the sky somewhere.\nMR. JOSEPH: Justice Souter, I believe, in\nfairness to the Fourth Circuit, on page 16(a) of the\npetition appendix, they said that they found Lincoln\nto be a nominal defendant, not a real party to the\ncontroversy. In that case, the relevance of the\nsubsidiary or other entity was to determine the\njurisdictional characteristics. And that is the\nreason why the Fourth Circuit found a failure of the\nburden of proof, because they could not identify, at\nthe time of that hearing, who was the appropriate\nsubsidiary and what the jurisdictional\ncharacteristics were.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, everything turned on\nthe nominal-party finding.\nMR. JOSEPH: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: On the nominal-party\nassumption.\nMR. JOSEPH: Correct. There's no dispute\nthat if Lincoln were a real party to the\ncontroversy, they don't have to join every other\nreal party to the controversy.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if the Fourth Circuit\nis wrong on nominal party, that's the end of the\ncase for your side.\nMR. JOSEPH: Not quite, Your Honor,\nbecause there's still the burden-of-proof issue.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the burden-of-\nproof issue, as you've just answered my question,\ndoes not arise until the Fourth Circuit finds that\nLincoln is a nominal party. And if, in fact, that\nconclusion is incorrect, then there's no burden-of-\nproof issue that has -- or no burden of proof that\nhas not been satisfied.\nMR. JOSEPH: That is correct only if Your\nHonor makes that determination based on matters that\nwere before the Fourth Circuit. There are a series\nof affidavits they rely on that were submitted after\nthe Fourth Circuit's determination which may affect\nthe determination as to whether or not Lincoln is a\nreal party to the controversy.\nSpecifically, in the blue brief, in\nfootnote 9, and in the yellow brief, in footnote 15,\nthey've adduced additional evidence. The Fourth\nCircuit was ruling at a point in time as to what the\nburden of proof was.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Joseph, do I take\nit that the essence of your position is that a\nremoving defendant, if that removing party is a\ncorporation, must disclose all affiliates that may\nhave been involved in the -- in the occurrence that\nthe plaintiff might have, but failed, to name as a\ndefendant, that a defendant -- although, on the\nsurface, there's complete diversity, a defendant\ncorporation must, in order to remove, identify all\nsubsidiaries and affiliates who might have been\nsued, as well?\nMR. JOSEPH: No, Your Honor, that's not\nour position. And the reason that's not our\nposition is that, at the time of removal, every\ndefendant that is, on the face of the complaint,\ndiverse has the ability to remove in order to defend\non the grounds that it is innocent -- the innocence\ngrounds. But if it then steps, instead, to defend\nthe merits on behalf of another in order to invoke a\nFederal forum -- instead of saying, \"Not me,\" which\nit could have done, but did not do -- had it said,\n\"Not me,\" then the plaintiff would have known that\nit should be looking at other entities. In fact, it\nsaid nothing of the sort.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But defendant never\ntook the position, \"Not me.\"\nMR. JOSEPH: That is the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Defendant said --\nMR. JOSEPH: -- entire issue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- \"Yes, we are the\nresponsible party.\"\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, that is correct.\nAnd they clearly were a party to the controversy.\nBut if they were not the real party to the\ncontroversy, they managed, perhaps, to acquire a\nFederal forum by virtue of stepping into the shoes\nof the subsidiaries. And that is the argument, that\nif they are not the real party to the controversy\nbecause they're litigating the merits on behalf of\nanother, it's the jurisdictional characteristics of\nthe other that are germane, and that's the burden-\nof-proof failure.\nThe \"real party to the controversy\"\ndoctrine is not a new doctrine to this Court. It\ngoes back to at least 1809, Brown against Strode. I\nmean, the -- it is a fundamental doctrine. And as\nJustice Ginsburg pointed out, it goes back as far,\nperhaps, as 1789, to the assignee clause in the\nJudiciary Act, in section --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but I also --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- pointed out it's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question? Did\nyou engage in discovery trying to determine who the\nreal party in interest was?\nMR. JOSEPH: Trial -- I wasn't trial\ncounsel, Your Honor. Trial counsel did, in the\nFourth Circuit supplemental appendix, at pages 35 to\n38, make inquiries.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, did he -- did he\ndo a thorough job of trying to find out who the real\nparty in interest --\nMR. JOSEPH: No, and -- they did not --\nand I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't it be his\nburden, if he thought it was the wrong person?\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, he didn't think\nit was the wrong person. He was being told it was\nthe right person, and shouldn't be faulted for lack\nof diligence in accepting the representations that\nthey had the right person.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah, but if you accept\nthe representation, then they sued the right people.\nMR. JOSEPH: But, Your Honor, it only\nturned out at the end that, in fact, that was not\ncorrect. And these matters snuck in through\ndiscovery, in the course of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It would seem to me --\nMR. JOSEPH: -- discovery that was a\nmerits discovery.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- if there was a\ndispute about this, it ought to -- there ought to\nhave been extensive discovery before you got to the\ncourt of appeals.\nMR. JOSEPH: Your Honor, there was --\nthere were discovery requests served. There was not\ndiscovery forthcoming on the issue of affiliates.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you had no -\n- I mean, you had no real reason to do it. You had\nsomebody there who accepted responsibility, in the\nsense that they were willing to defend on the\nmerits, right?\nMR. JOSEPH: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice, which is the reason --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it's only\nbecause you lost that you now question whether or\nnot they should have accepted -- you're saying they\nshouldn't have accepted responsibility, and\nshouldn't have defended on the merits.\nMR. JOSEPH: There is no doubt, Your\nHonor, this is a Hail Mary pass, because the court\nhad made clear what its decision was going to be.\nBut Hail Mary passes connect. And the question is\nwhether or not a real party to the controversy was,\nin fact, litigating. And we believe that it was\nnot. And that -- we basically come to the argument\nthat limited jurisdiction means the limits must be\nrespected. \"Real party to the controversy\" doctrine\nis an established limit. There are federalism\nissues involved, and we submit that the fourth\ncircuit's judgments should be affirmed, because we\ndid not have the real party to the controversy.\nThank you very much, Your Honors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nJoseph.\nMr. Frederick, you have nine minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. FREDERICK: I would waive, but for the\nclarification of two points in the record.\nNumber one, we take umbrage at being\naccused of a lack of candor in this Court.\nParagraph 22 of their complaint says, and I'll\nquote, \"All the defendants, acting through Lincoln\nand/or their obligations as owners of the property\nthrough the lease and acting by and through their\nagents, were responsible for one or more acts of\ncommon law and/or statutory negligent conduct with\nrespect to Roche's apartment, including, but not\nlimited to,\" a long laundry list.\nWhen the parent is sued for the acts of\nits agents, and the parent comes forward and says,\n\"We will accept the responsibility for our agents,\"\nthere's no cause to be accused of a lack of candor\nsimply because there's no effort later to identify\nwho those agents are.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I guess what he's\nsaying -- I'm trying to put the -- as good a light\non it as I can -- it's a -- that if, in fact -- if a\nbig real-estate developer, which is a corporation --\nwhat they do is, they organize a lot of deals, and\ntheir deals would take the form of hundreds and\nhundreds of limited partnerships, which are owned\nbuildings in various States. And I think he's\nsaying, \"Well, for diversity purposes, we should\nconsider the citizenship of the parent corporation\nto be the citizenship of the limited partnership\nthat happens to have control of the building that\nwe're complaining about.\"\nMR. FREDERICK: And Lincoln had control.\nIt was acting through agents. That's undisputed.\nBut the lease says Lincoln Property Company is the\nparty, as agent, for the owner, SWIB. Lincoln\nProperty Company set the policies for the mold.\nLincoln Property Company hired Mr. Roche as an\nemployee. Lincoln Property Company directed the\nactions of all of the people involved in this. And\nso, there's not -- there's not any basis on which\nLincoln Property could come -- Company could say,\n\"We are not responsible.\" And when this was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, he thinks --\nMR. FREDERICK: -- put to us --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- you are responsible,\nbut he thinks you ought to have the citizenship of\nthe intermediate entities that own, or manage\ndirectly, the building.\nMR. FREDERICK: There would be no\nauthority from this Court to so hold. And there --\nthe interrogatory that he points to, interrogatory\nnumber 3, reads as follows, \"Identify every person,\nother than your attorneys, who is aware of the facts\nand circumstances surrounding Mr. Roche's lease at\nWestfield Village Apartments and repeat in detail\nthe substance of such person's knowledge.\"\nNow, from that interrogatory, we are\nsupposed to infer that there are -- a question about\nthe citizenship of the affiliated entities through\nwhich Lincoln is operating. We put forward all of\nthe names of the people that we could identify who\nhad some knowledge about this. But I would submit\nto you that a response, as he is suggesting here in\nthis Court, is not a reasonable one.\nFinally, with respect to Mr. Franzen, the\nfact that his title may say \"partner\" surely cannot\ntransform the corporation documents that say that\nLincoln Property Company is a corporation in the\nState of Texas.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nFrederick.\n"
