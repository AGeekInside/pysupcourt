OLSON\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 04-1704\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nRespondents dispute the wisdom, efficacy, and\nconstitutionality of Ohio's franchise tax system, but\nthey face two insurmountable obstacles in this Court.\nFirst, they cannot demonstrate any actual, concrete,\nand direct injury as a result of Ohio's investment tax\ncredit to satisfy the irreducible minimum requirement\nfor standing in this Court. Secondly, the facial\nDormant Commerce Clause challenge that they bring is\nwithout merit.\nOhio imposes no burdens or tariffs on\ninterstate commerce. Its investment incentive program\nis available on equal terms to in-State, out-of-State,\nlocal, or interstate businesses. It is\nnondiscriminatory, and it stimulates, rather than\nimpedes, commerce.\nRespondents are not injured when a business\nwith which they do not compete receives a reduction in\ntheir taxes as a result of a tax credit. Respondents\npay no higher taxes for products. They suffer no\ncoercion because of a tax credit that is given to\nothers. Their tax burden is not increased by Ohio's\ninvestment tax credit, nor will it be lessened if it is\neliminated.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, who would have\n-- who would have standing? I understand your argument\nthat Ohio taxpayers don't, but are there people who\nwould have standing?\nMR. OLSON: I'm not sure, Justice Ginsburg.\nIn some of this Court's Dormant Commerce Clause cases,\ncompetitors, who are arguably injured because they are\npaying a higher tax against the -- compared to the\ncompany that's receiving the benefit -- in a couple of\ncases, this Court has recognized customers of companies\nthat are paying higher products, and, therefore,\npotentially higher prices, for the products that they\npurchase. And, in one or two cases, States have been\nrecognized for purposes of standing. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think there has to be\nsomebody who can challenge it, though.\nMR. OLSON: No, we don't think that at all.\nAs this Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Some of our opinions say\nthat, don't they, that --\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it's not necessarily true\nthat there has to be --\nMR. OLSON: What -- Justice Scalia, I think\nthe strongest statement is in the Valley Forge case, at\npage 489, where the Court said, \"If Respondents have no\n-- the argument that if Respondents have no standing to\nsue, no one would have standing, is not a reason to\nfind standing.\" This would convert \"standing\" into a\nrequirement that must be observed only when satisfied.\nBut the fact is that under any standard articulated by\nthis Court in its article III cases, the Respondents\nhere do not having standing. The effect of the tax is\nvery \"uncertain, hypothetical, or speculative,\" to use\nthe words of this Court, with respect to them. They\ncannot demonstrate that they are affected by it. And\nas --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, I had asked you\nthe question, because I wanted to know whether this\ncase was distinguishable from Flast in that regard,\nalthough I recognize your quotation from Valley Forge.\nThat -- Flast seemed to be a case that fit that\ndescription, that there was no one who would have a\nbetter claim for injury, in fact.\nMR. OLSON: Well, nonetheless, the Court made\nthat distinction in the Flast case with respect to the\nEstablishment Clause, and, specifically, the spending\nand taxing powers exercised by Congress. And the Court\ndetermined, in that case, that the Establishment Clause\nwas a specific limitation on spending authority. The\nCourt has been very careful, and many Justices of this\nCourt, individually, have said that that distinction in\nthat case will not be extended beyond the Establishment\nClause, in the context of spending, in connection with\na religious conviction, or the establishment of a\nreligion. The Court has indicated, frequently, I\nthink, that that is not going to be extended.\nAt any rate, it wouldn't be extended -- the\nlogic of Flast wouldn't be applicable here anyway.\nThis is not an application of the spending power by\nCongress or the taxing power by Congress. This is the\nCommerce Clause, which is a permissive grant of\nauthority to Congress, and, at most, under the Dormant\nCommerce Clause, a limitation on the States.\nThese respondents are not remotely close to\nwhat this Court has said are the irreducible minimums.\nEven if they --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With respect to the\nclaims that are before us. But there was standing\nbelow for the municipal taxpayers with respect to their\nchallenge to the property taxes.\nMR. OLSON: We believed, at the time, that\nthere was standing with respect to the property taxes -\n- the municipal taxpayers, with respect to the property\ntaxes. That was the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. OLSON: -- basis for the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, why isn't --\nthese -- why aren't the present claims brought under --\nyou know, within the same nucleus of operative facts,\nthe same sort of supplemental jurisdiction that allows\nthe Federal court to consider purely State law claims\nif they have jurisdiction of another related Federal\nclaim?\nMR. OLSON: The Court has never treated\narticle III standing that way, Mr. Chief Justice. The\nCourt has said, \"a standing is not dispensed in gross\"\n-- that was the Lewis versus Casey case -- that\nstanding has to looked at -- be looked at individually\nwith respect to the claim. Furthermore, this -- there\nwas not an identical nucleus of facts. I mean, it is the\n-- the property tax exemption was issued pursuant to a\ncontract between the company here, DaimlerChrysler, and\nthe City of Toledo. The State tax --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But just to get -- I\nmean, you don't dispute the standing of the municipal\ntaxpayers on the property tax issue?\nMR. OLSON: We did not, and do not. Now, I --\nthere may be arguments that might be made, that are\nnot before this Court, with respect to the whole idea\nof --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if it's an\narticle III issue, I think that's always before us.\nMR. OLSON: Well, with respect to the\nmunicipal taxpayers and the -- and whether there would\nbe standing to challenge the property tax exemption.\nThat's not an issue that has been briefed here. It's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I was thinking\nif your -- if the argument is that the claims that\nyou're concerned about today can be piggybacked onto\nthe other ones, then we do have to consider whether\nthere's a pig to piggyback them onto.\nMR. OLSON: Yes. But that would require a\nrather significant change in the Court's article III\nstanding jurisprudence. It would, furthermore, allow\nthe tail to wag the dog, the exception to swallow the\nrule. If anybody could bring any kind of a case at\nall, then all manner of cases of -- with -- for which\nthe Court had no jurisdiction at all could be along\nwith them.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In any case, it's clear that\nthat -- that that entity no longer has standing, isn't\nit?\nMR. OLSON: No, the -- there's a separate\nentity, called Kim's Auto. That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: -- that entity no longer has\nstanding. There are still property taxpayers, but that\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they don't --\nMR. OLSON: -- that's cause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they don't -- I mean, I\nthought the assumption here is that they don't have\nstanding. The --\nMR. OLSON: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The former standing of Kim's\nAuto cannot allow this suit to proceed, under any\ntheory --\nMR. OLSON: That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- can it?\nMR. OLSON: That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you have to have\nstanding during the entire --\nMR. OLSON: That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- process --\nMR. OLSON: That's absolutely correct. But\nthe Chief Justice was asking me about the municipal\nproperty taxpayers with respect to the claim concerning\nthe property tax exemption. Those plaintiffs --\nrespondents are still in the case. That's not Kim's\nAuto.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but the only person who\ncould give them standing, even by this associational\ntheory, is gone.\nMR. OLSON: No, there are -- there are still\nproperty tax -- some of the respondents that are still\nin the case are property taxpayers. Kim's Auto --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But --\nMR. OLSON: -- wasn't the only one.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they are not property\ntaxpayers who have standing under any -- under the\nargument that you've just made.\nMR. OLSON: With respect to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The only property-tax\nindividual who had standing was somebody whose land had\nbeen condemned. None of these other people in it have\nhad their land condemned --\nMR. OLSON: In --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- have they?\nMR. OLSON: In fairness, Justice Scalia, I\nthink that there are other respondents who claim to be\nproperty taxpayers in the City of Toledo, aside from\nKim's Auto.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whose land has been\ncondemned.\nMR. OLSON: No. They are -- they are\ncomplaining about the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but --\nMR. OLSON: -- property tax --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- but you say that a\nproperty taxowner, simply by being -- simply by being\nsubject to the property tax, does not having standing.\nIsn't that your position?\nMR. OLSON: No, we're saying -- we -- the\nproperty -- under this Court's jurisprudence, municipal\ntaxpayers have been permitted, under some\ncircumstances, to challenge municipal actions,\nirrespective of the imminent domain proceeding. So,\nthere is that separate issue that's in the case.\nIf I might, I would like to spend a moment or\ntwo with respect to the merits of this case, because it\nis a very important issue.\nNearly every State in the United States has\nsome sort of incentive program. This -- with respect\nto the location of businesses or the drawing of\nbusinesses within the State, which is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, I don't mean to\ndeflect you from getting on to the merits, but there\nwas one point in your brief that was of concern to me.\nThat is, you said that you questioned whether,\nassuming we accept your argument on standing, it would\nbe appropriate to return this case to the court of\nappeals with instructions that it be remanded to the\nState court and with the counsel fees that 1447 entitle\none to. And you said that would not be right.\nMR. OLSON: No. We believe that the case was\nproperly removed, and, therefore, there's not counsel\nfees with respect to the removal statute; that the\nproper resolution would be to vacate the Sixth Circuit\ndecision and then remand to the district court for a\ndismissal because of lack of standing, or the Court --\nthis Court hasn't resolved whether it would be a\ndismissal or a remand to the -- to the State court. We\ndon't believe that there would be standing under State\ncourt taxpayer or State -- Ohio jurisprudence, either.\nIf I may, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to\nreserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Cole.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 04-1724\nMR. COLE: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nWe agree with DaimlerChrysler's position,\nboth as to standing and as to the merits. The\nRespondents' grievance as taxpayers, the sole standing\nargument they press here, is a textbook example of the\ngeneralized public grievance that the Court has\nrepeatedly rejected as a basis for -- or for standing.\nRespondents' only claimed taxpayer harm is their\nassertion that the State fist loses money as a result\nof the investment tax credit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do they have standing\nin State court?\nMR. COLE: Your Honor, we do not believe that\nthey have standing in State court, either. Ohio has a\ntaxpayer standing doctrine much like the Federal\ntaxpayer standing doctrine. They would need to show\nsome unique harm separable to them. I believe the\nlanguage is that they would have to show that they\ncontribute to a special fund. And that's out of a case\ncalled Masterson, in Ohio. There is a separate Sheward\ncase that the Respondents cite in, I believe, footnote\n5 of their brief. We don't believe that this falls\nwithin the Sheward exception to standing, in Ohio.\nThere's a certain exception that allows certain case\nof great public importance to go directly to the\nSupreme Court, but we do not believe that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So --\nMR. COLE: -- this would fall within that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what about the\nmunicipal taxpayers on the property tax claim that we\nwere talking about earlier?\nMR. COLE: Yes, Your Honor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do they have\nstanding?\nMR. COLE: Yes. And I wanted to respond a\nlittle bit to Justice Scalia's point. I think what\nthey're trying to claim is, because they have municipal\ntaxpayer standing to challenge the property tax\nexemption, that that somehow allows them, then, to\nsweep in their challenge to the investment tax credit,\nas well. We don't dispute that they have municipal\ntaxpayer standing to challenge the property tax\nexemption. We do, however, dispute whether or not that\ngives them standing to also challenge the ITC.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's because it's a\nlocal -- it's a Toledo city property tax, is that the\ndistinction you're making?\nMR. COLE: Well, the property tax exemption\nis a State tax program, Your Honor, but it requires\naction by local city leaders --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, that's --\nMR. COLE: -- to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You would be challenging\nthe local action --\nMR. COLE: It --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- rather than the State --\nMR. COLE: It --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- action, and that's how\nyou distinguish the municipal taxpayer.\nMR. COLE: In a sense, that's right, Your\nHonor. This Court has noted that the relationship\nbetween a municipal citizen and a municipal corporation\nis akin to between a shareholder and a corporation,\ngenerally, and that, in some instances, that will allow\nthe municipal citizens to challenge the actions of\ntheir municipal leaders, in a sense. This property tax\nexemption involves that type of action. It would, in a\nsense, be a challenge to that, and, I think, cognizable\nunder the Court's municipal taxpayer --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, a tax -- just --\nso, a taxpayer in Wyoming can't challenge the State tax,\nbecause his claim is too diffuse, but a resident in New\nYork City can challenge the city tax, because it's not.\nMR. COLE: Your Honor, when looked at from a\nnumerical basis, I agree that the distinction might not\nseem to carry a lot of weight. The Court, however, has\nnot looked at it in terms of numbers, it has looked at\nit in terms of the, quote, \"special relationship\" that\narises between a municipal citizen and a -- and a\ncorporation. And presumably that special relationship\nexists independent of the size of the municipality.\nBut, in any event, whether or not they have\nmunicipal taxpayer standing to challenge the property\ntax exemption, there's no way to somehow grow that into\nstanding to challenge the separate enactment by the\nOhio General Assembly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There's also a\nredressability problem, too, isn't there? I mean,\nassuming they could, is there any -- would action\nagainst the Assembly eliminate their tax?\nMR. COLE: It wouldn't, Your Honor, although --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No?\nMR. COLE: -- I think it puts a point on the\nproblem with, in a sense, trying to grow a standing. You\nask, would it redress? And I guess the question is,\nredress what? I mean, they don't have any separate\nharm associated with the investment tax credit that's\nconstitutionally cognizable.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There are some -- at least\nit's arguable that there's Federal municipal taxpayer\nstanding. And certainly some States have said that\nthere is. And that -- and whatever Ohio might or might not\ndo is not relevant to this proceeding. We don't know\nthat. I'm -- you've given your opinion on what it\nwould be.\nMR. COLE: Well, that's correct, Your Honor,\nbut, still, there needs to be some way to grow the\nmunicipal taxpayer standing into --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's a --\nMR. COLE: -- standing to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that's the piggybacking\nquestion. That's quite different. And --\nMR. COLE: Right. Exactly, Your Honor. And\nmy only suggestion was that, even if there is municipal\ntaxpayer standing to challenge a property tax\nexemption, which we've conceded below, that doesn't\nsomehow confer standing to challenge of separate\nenactment by Ohio's General Assembly. Respondents, in\ntheir brief, talk about this notion of ancillary\nstanding, but that -- the case they cited -- and they --\nprincipally, they talk about the Flast case, where,\nin addition to considering the Establishment Clause\nchallenge, the Court also, in a footnote, mentioned the\nfree-exercise challenge and the question of whether\nthere would be separate standing for that.\nBut there, in the Flast case, it was a\nsituation where they were using two theories to attack\nthe same legislative enactment. Here, they're trying\nto attack a statute which they haven't shown causes\nthem any harm. And so, the case is -- the challenge\nthat they are bringing is, in a sense, an abstract\nchallenge. It isn't one that's in a -- in a form\nthat's judicially cognizable. That's why this\nancillary standing theory, which would represent a\ndramatic expansion of the Court's article III\njurisprudence, would not be a sound constitutional\ninterpretation. It would allow the Court to interject\nitself into disputes where there's no injury to any --\nno concrete injury to any specifically identified\nplaintiff.\nArticle III's case for a controversy\nrequirement is supposed to ensure that when the Court\ntakes action, it takes action in the context of a\nparticular concrete harm, and it can do its legal\nanalysis against the backdrop of this plaintiff who's\nbeen harmed in this manner. These plaintiffs can't\nmeet that. They haven't shown any harm to themselves,\nany judicially cognizable harm, under article III.\nIf I could, for a moment, Your Honors, I'd\nalso like to turn to the merits, briefly, of the\nRespondents' claim.\nWe believe Respondents' claim also fails on\nthe merits of the Dormant Commerce Clause. Ohio\nprovides a benefit for those who invest in the State;\nbut Respondents have not, and cannot, identify any\nburden that the ITC places on interstate commerce.\nAbsent that burden, their Dormant Commerce Clause claim\nfails.\nJUSTICE BREYER: On the merits, I think that\ntheir claim is -- take company A and company B. Both\nare located in Toledo, both hire a certain number of\npeople, have a certain payroll, have a certain amount\nof property, and have a certain amount of business.\nIdentical. And they're charged a tax. And now, what --\ncompany B, when it's thinking of building a new plant\nor make new investment in machinery, if it goes to\nWisconsin, it will discover it pays less taxes on all\nthose things that were already in Ohio. And,\ntherefore, the people who sell land or machinery in\nWisconsin are discovering it isn't being bought,\nbecause that old tax, which really had nothing to do\nwith this new investment, is now less because of the\nnew investment. So, that hurts businesses in\nWisconsin.\nAs I understand it, that's their claim. And\nif I've got it wrong, I'm sure you'll correct me.\nMR. COLE: Well, I don't think that -- that's\nnot the way that I understand their --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. COLE: -- claim, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then I'm probably\nwrong.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. COLE: I understand their claim -- I\nunderstand their claim more to be that two identically\nsituated businesses, if -- both have the same tax bill\n--one builds a new facility in Ohio, one builds a new\nfacility in Wisconsin. The one who builds the new\nfacility in Ohio is going to have a lower tax bill than\nthe one who builds the new facility in Wisconsin.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, that -- that is true,\nand then the effect of that is that firms that now do\nbusiness in Ohio won't build their new facility in\nWisconsin, because they like the lower tax bill in\nOhio. And that hurts businesses and others in\nWisconsin.\nMR. COLE: Your --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You were saying they have no\nharm? I think they're pointing to that harm.\nMR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, first, I'd note\nthat's not a harm that they face, of course, going back\nto --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what is the harm --\nMR. COLE: -- standing issue, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- they think -- well, they\ncan tell me. All right.\nMR. COLE: Yes. But --\n[Laughter.]\nMR. COLE: -- separately, Your Honor, I think\nwhat -- in this Court's Dormant Commerce Clause\njurisprudence, when the Court has talked about\n\"burden,\" in the past, the Court has talked about the\nsituation where activity out of State is somehow\nassessed a tax. That is, the tax in State A goes up as\na result of activities in State B. The Westinghouse\ncase is a perfect example. There, there was a New York\ntax that increased for each export transaction that\noccurred outside the State. In a sense, New York was\nexporting the tax burden to activities that existed in\nsome other State. And that's the sense in which the\nCourt has used the word \"burden\" in its past cases, not\nthis more amorphous sense that Plaintiffs -- or\nRespondents are pushing here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There isn't -- the tax\ncredit doesn't give them -- require them to buy, in\nState. I mean, the purchase -- whatever they equip the\nplant with can come from vendors and manufacturers, out\nof State?\nMR. COLE: That's absolutely right, Your\nHonor. There's no limit on where the taxpayer\npurchases the equipment they install in the State.\nThere's no limit -- no effect on where the goods from\nthe factory go. There's no limit on who you can hire\nto work in the factory, or where they come from.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the credit's available\nto out-of-State companies.\nMR. COLE: Absolutely, Your Honor. The\ncredit is available independent of whether you already\nhave a presence in Ohio, whether you've never had a\npresence in Ohio, whether you've never even paid taxes\nin Ohio before. Certainly, if you invested within the\nState, you're now going to have a corporate franchise\ntax bill, and the credit would be useful to you at that\npoint. But you could have had no pre-existing\nrelationship with the State at all, as a taxpayer, and\nstill take advantage of this tax credit. It's equally\navailable to all comers.\nThe only question is, What do you do in the\nState of Ohio? Do you invest money in the State of\nOhio? And the credit turns on the amount of that\nactivity in Ohio. If DaimlerChrysler establishes a new\nplant in Missouri or Montana or California, it, in no\nway, impacts the credit that they receive in Ohio.\nThey're not deprived of that credit. It doesn't become\nof a -- of a lower value because of their decision to\ninvest elsewhere.\nAnd so, under this Court's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it would be\nof higher value if they invest it in Ohio. I mean,\nthat's all --\nMR. COLE: Interestingly, Your Honor, it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Presumably, the Ohio\nlegislators were not doing this irrationally.\nMR. COLE: I would -- I would hope not, Your\nHonor. I mean, I think the sense is that it increases\ninvestment in Ohio. And that's what this Court has\ncalled a \"laudable goal\" of State economic policy, is\nto try to increase investment within the State to\nbenefit the citizens of the State. Certainly, that's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That -- in some\nsense, at the expense of the citizens in other States.\nMR. COLE: I don't know, Your Honor. A\ncouple of responses to that. First, to the extent this\nspurs investment that otherwise would not have taken\nplace anywhere else, of course that's just positive\nsum. That's new economic development that wouldn't\nhave occurred, but for this incentive, or incentives\nlike it.\nOf course, at some level there's going to be\ncompetition for where these manufacturing facilities\nare located. But, again, this Court has noted that\ncompetition among the States for their share -- or\ntheir fair share of interstate commerce is not, in and\nof itself, a Commerce Clause problem. The question is\nonly when that competition becomes discriminatory in\nsome way. And what the Court has meant by\n\"discriminatory\" is, Does it somehow tax your decision\nto be somewhere else? When you decide to be in\nMissouri, does that increase your Ohio tax bill over\nwhat it would otherwise be?\nCamps Newfound, perfect example. You decide\nthat you're going to serve an interstate clientele,\nyour tax bill goes up above what it would be if you\ndidn't serve an interstate clientele. And Ohio's tax\ncredit doesn't have that characteristic that the Court\nhas found so troubling.\nIn fact, looking back through the Court's\ncases, over and over again this notion of burden comes\nup, and -- whereby, \"burden,\" it means \"imposing taxes\non the business of other State,\" all the way back to\nGuy versus Baltimore, \"You can't build up your commerce\nby means of an -- unequal and oppressive burdens upon\nthe industry and business of other States.\"\nSo, certainly if Ohio were attempting to tax\nDaimlerChrysler, or treat DaimlerChrysler worse because\nit had put a plant in Missouri, that would create a\nDormant Commerce Clause question. But here, there's\nsimply nothing like that. In fact, Respondents' theory\nwould dramatically expand this Court's Dormant Commerce\nClause jurisprudence, and would strike down a whole\nswath of State laws that have engendered substantial\ninvestment-backed expectation at this point. Billions\nof dollars have been invested by thousands of companies\nin reliance on various forms of locational credits,\nwhether it be job incentive credits, whether it be\ninvestment tax credits, whether it be environmental\ncleanup credits. All of those credits would be at risk\nunder the theory that Plaintiffs espouse.\nYour Honors, this Court has more than once\nnoted that the Commerce Clause demands that the States\nmust sink or swim together, but it has never suggested\nthat the States must be indifferent between those two\noptions. Frankly, Your Honor, the States would prefer\nto swim. ITCs like Ohio's help the States keep their\neconomies afloat.\nRespondents disagree with this, as a policy\nmatter, but that debate belongs in Ohio's statehouse,\nnot here. The ITC is not protectionist, and it imposes\nno burden on interstate commerce. And, thus, it does\nnot violate the Dormant Commerce Clause.\nOhio respectfully urges the Court to reverse\nthe decision below or, in the alternative, to vacate\nthe decision for lack of standing.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?\nWould the case be any different if, instead of a tax\ncredit, they offered a cash subsidy?\nMR. COLE: Your Honor, I don't actually think\nit would be any different, in the sense that neither\none of those two would violate the Dormant Commerce\nClause. Of course, this Court has noted, in various\ncases, albeit in dicta, that subsidies ordinarily do\nnot run afoul of the Dormant Commerce Clause. I think\nthis tax credit ends up having the same economic\nimpact. And, for all the reasons I stated about a lack\nof burden, even if some tax credits that might be like\nsubsidies could create a Dormant Commerce Clause\nproblem, this tax credit does not. It imposes no\nburden on out-of-State activities.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Cole.\nMr. Enrich.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER ENRICH\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. ENRICH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to begin with the question of\nstanding, and then turn to the Commerce Clause merits.\nLet me begin at the point where Petitioners\nand Respondents agree on the question of standing. The\noriginal lawsuit brought by Respondents in the Ohio\nState Court raised two claims, one challenging the\ninvestment tax credit that's before this Court today,\nthe other challenging the property tax exemption. The\npoint on which Petitioners and Respondents agree is\nthat Respondents do have standing, in their status as\nmunicipal taxpayers, to bring their challenge to the\nproperty tax exemption. And, indeed, the district\ncourt agreed and found that there was standing, in the\ndistrict court's judgment, to reach both parts of the\ncase on the basis of the Respondents' municipal\ntaxpayer standing.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any authority at\nall for saying you can piggyback the basic case or\ncontroversy requirement? I mean, it's one thing to say\nyou can hook a nondiverse claim, but it's a claim; it's\na case or controversy. I'm -- I don't know of any\nauthority that says that you can -- you can take a\nmatter that is not a constitutional case or controversy\nand latch it onto something that does qualify.\nMR. ENRICH: Justice Ginsburg, there are two\nreasons why we believe that there is such a basis.\nFirst, there are cases -- one case in this Court, in\nFlast v. Cohen, where the Court has found that standing\nto raise one claim extended, as well, to raise, in that\ncase, a free-exercise claim. There are a number of\nsuch cases in the courts of appeals. Wright and Miller\nhas recognized a concept of what they refer to as\n\"ancillary standing\" on that basis.\nBut the second point that we think is perhaps\nmore important is, once there is one claim in the case\nthat satisfies the article III \"case and controversy\"\nrequirement, then there is a case or controversy here.\nThe question that then faces this Court is, how far\nshould it reach in addressing the other claims which\nare part of that very same case or controversy?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think it was pointed out\nthat, in Flast, at least, you were dealing with the\nsame spending on the part of the Federal Government.\nHere, you have apples and oranges. The property tax is\nquite discrete from the investment tax credit.\nMR. ENRICH: That is true, Your Honor. And\nin at least some of the circuit court cases, they have\nreached a second claim where the -- where a different\npart of the same transaction was being attacked. The\nSierra Club case that we cite in our brief is one good\nexample of that.\nIn the present case, the two issues that we\nchallenge both arise out of the very same transaction,\nout of a deal that was entered into between the City of\nToledo and DaimlerChrysler --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I back you up\njust a bit before we talk about piggybacking? This\nCourt hasn't held that municipal taxpayers have\nstanding in this sort of situation, have they?\nMR. ENRICH: No, this Court has not ever had\nto address the question of municipal taxpayer standing,\nexcept in Establishment Clause contexts.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if you want us to\npiggyback, we -- and if it is an article III question -\n- we would have to decide that issue before we can\ndecide whether we can piggyback your current claims\nonto it.\nMR. ENRICH: Mr. Chief Justice, you would at\nleast have to decide the question of whether municipal\ntaxpayer standing was -- satisfied the article III\nrequirements under your standing doctrines. If you\nfound that it satisfied the article III requirements,\nthen that would suffice to bring this case or\ncontroversy past the article III threshold --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And you agree\nthat the --\nMR. ENRICH: -- bring us to prudential\nthreshold.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you agree that\nthe municipal taxpayer standing on the property tax\nquestion is an open issue before this Court. We have\nnot had a holding on that.\nMR. ENRICH: That's absolutely correct, Your\nHonor. We would suggest that, in keeping with the\nconsistent holdings of every circuit court that has\naddressed this topic, it would make sense for this\nCourt to acknowledge municipal taxpayer standing, or,\nat the very least, to acknowledge that the obstacles,\nany obstacles to municipal taxpayer standing, are\nprudential obstacles, rather than article III\nobstacles.\nThere are actually other reasons why we\nbelieve the article III barrier is crossed. We believe\nthat this case -- that, as Judge Posner wrote in a\nrecent opinion that we referenced in a letter to the\nCourt -- it came out after our brief was filed -- in\nhis analysis of the taxpayer standing cases, he\nconcluded that the Court's burden on taxpayer standing\nwas based on prudential, not on constitutional grounds.\nWe believe his analysis is correct.\nOnce this becomes a question of the\nprudential standards, we believe that the very\nparticular factual history of this case provides ample\nreason for the Court to find that there should be\nstanding in this particular case to reach the\ninvestment tax-credit claim.\nRespondents brought this case in the Ohio\nState courts largely out of a recognition that the\nstandards for standing were different in the State and\nFederal courts in this area. In fact, if Petitioners\nfelt that we didn't have standing in Ohio, perhaps the\nwisest strategy for them would have been to oppose\nstanding there. But, instead, they chose to remove the\ncase to the Federal court. And there, we requested\nthat the case be remanded to the State courts, because\nwe identified to the district court the risk, that if\nthe Federal court kept the case, we might find\nourselves, years later, before a higher court that\nmight say, \"But you don't have standing,\" and require\nus to go back and begin all over in the State courts.\nPetitioners, at that time, argued that, in\nfact, we did have standing. And the district court so\nheld. And then Petitioners have not again raised the\nquestion of standing until before this Court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have you found any other\ninstance in which -- any case -- there was a absolute\nlack of standing, prudential standing, but the Court\nwaived that, because it was prudential and not\nconstitutional?\nMR. ENRICH: Yes, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which one?\nMR. ENRICH: In Craig v. Boren, this is\nexactly what the -- this Court did. There, the one\nplaintiff who provided standing for a sex\ndiscrimination claim no longer had standing by the time\nthe case was adjudicated. The plaintiff who ultimately\nhad standing to keep the case going was one who,\nalthough she suffered an actual injury, was not -- was\nasserting third-party rights, and so, did not satisfy\nprudential standing requirements.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the case use the phrase\n\"capable of repetition and evading review,\" or -- which\nis a mootness --\nMR. ENRICH: I actually --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I just have to read Craig --\nMR. ENRICH: -- don't believe that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- on the --\nMR. ENRICH: -- they did use that concept in\nCraig. I think that's a concept that has come into\nthis Court's jurisprudence more frequently in later\ncases --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The problem in Craig, with\nthe name plaintiff, is, it wasn't a class action, an\n18-year-old sent to turn 21 in the fullness of time.\nBut I didn't understand your answer about the beer\nseller whose standing saved the case, at least in the\nview of the majority of this Court. She had a real\npocketbook injury. She was not able to sell her beer\nto the thirsty boys. So --\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I don't understand why\nthat's an example of a loose standing connection. I\nmean, she surely had an -- a pocketbook injury. True,\nshe was complaining about a denial of equal protection\nto the fraternity brothers, but that she had an injury,\nin fact, there was no doubt.\nMR. ENRICH: Justice Ginsburg, the premise\nbehind our argument is that the article III hurdle is\ncleared on other grounds, on grounds that I've already\ndiscussed and we can certainly reiterate. The question\nthen becomes -- on prudential grounds. And that is the\nissue that was presented in Craig, that she had a\ndirect injury, but she was in -- she did not satisfy\nthe prudential standards because she was asserting\nthird-party rights. And what this Court there held\nwas, because the parties had adjudicated the issue\nbelow without objecting about standing, that the Court\nwould proceed to the merits.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no lack of\nstanding below. The problem was that the -- Craig\nturned 21 while the case was pending in this Court.\nThere was standing below. He was 18 when the\nlitigation started.\nMR. ENRICH: Yes, Your Honor, that -- and,\nsimilarly, we believe that there was standing, and\nstill is standing, for the Plaintiffs to be in this\nCourt on article III grounds because of the continuing\npendency of our challenge to the property tax exemption\nas municipal taxpayers. We --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, could I ask about\nthe ancillary doctrine? You say the case you cite to\nestablish it is Flast versus Cohen. Was the doctrine\ndiscussed in Flast versus Cohen, or are you relying\nsimply on the fact that Flast versus Cohen involved\nboth an Establishment Clause and a free-exercise\nchallenge, and the Court only discussed the\nEstablishment Clause challenge?\nMR. ENRICH: No, Justice Scalia, in a\nfootnote in Flast, the Court specifically says, \"Having\nnow decided that there's Establishment Clause standing,\nwe can also reach the free-exercise question without\ndiscussing whether there would be\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I --\nMR. ENRICH: -- \"independent standing\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- I had not --\nMR. ENRICH: -- \"for that claim\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- recollected that\nfootnote. I will -- I will find it. I don't read\nfootnotes, normally.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In any event, they were\nattacking the same thing. So, your case is different,\nat least to that extent, that you have two discrete\ntaxes.\nMR. ENRICH: It is, indeed, Your Honor. We\nacknowledge that, although, again, as I say, in some of\nthe lower court cases there have been challenges where\nthe claim that the plaintiffs did not have standing\nwith regard to was challenging a different outcome in\nthe same transaction or occurrence. The specific\nexample was a challenge to an environmental impact\nstatement, where the plaintiffs had standing to\nchallenge certain elements, but did not have standing\nto challenge the potential -- the failure of this\nimpact statement to consider impacts on indigenous\ntribes. And the District -- the District of Columbia\nCircuit held that they did have standing, based on\ntheir other standing claims, to reach that claim, as\nwell.\nIf I can turn, Your Honors, to the merits, if\nOhio were to impose an income tax on those corporations\nwhich did their manufacturing outside of the State of\nOhio, but not to impose that tax on those businesses\nwhich did their manufacturing inside of Ohio, there's\nno question that such attacks would violate the\nCommerce Clause by facially discriminating in favor of\nin-State business activity. It would be a tariff, by\nany other name.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about the fact that a\nState has a lower income tax or a lower property tax\nthan any other State in the Union? Does that violate\nthe Commerce Clause because it induces businesses to --\nMR. ENRICH: No, Your Honor, we are not\nsuggesting that any tax measure which gives an -- which\nencourages businesses to locate in the jurisdiction,\nposes a Commerce Clause problem. A Commerce Clause --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's --\nMR. ENRICH: -- problem --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's the difference?\nMR. ENRICH: A Commerce Clause problem, Your\nHonor, is posed only when the provision provides a\nbenefit which is specifically distinguished and\nprovided to in-State activity but not provided --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that's the case --\nMR. ENRICH: -- to out-of-State --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's the case --\nMR. ENRICH: -- activity.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- in the tax example. I\nmean, the taxes are apportioned. The part of the tax --\nor the business that would be taxable in the State\ngets taxed at a lower rate. Businesses say, \"Gee,\nlet's do more business in Ohio and pay less taxes.\" In\nthis case, they're getting, effectively, taxed at a\nlower rate, because they make an investment in Ohio.\nMR. ENRICH: But, Your Honor, in this case,\nthe only ones who are getting the lower effective tax\nrate are those who locate their manufacturing activity\nin the State.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I --\nMR. ENRICH: They --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The only one who gets the\nadvantage of the lower -- the lower income tax rate and\nthe lower property tax rate is someone who is located\nin the State. It's exactly the same.\nMR. ENRICH: Well, I'm -- in the case of a\nlower income tax rate, Your Honor -- it's a different\nsituation for the lower property tax rate, but take the\nlower income tax rate first -- the lower income tax\nrate will reduce the tax burden on all businesses,\nwherever their manufacturing capacity is located, who\nhave a taxable business presence in Ohio. There is no\ndiscrimination based on where they locate any activity.\nIf they locate new activity in Ohio, more of their\nincome will be subjected to that lower rate of tax, but\nthat is not discriminating between two businesses,\nbased on where they locate their activity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I told you, you have to\nlocate -- you'd have to locate in the low-tax State to\nget advantage of the low -- of the low tax.\nMR. ENRICH: That's not true, Your Honor.\nThe way that corporate income taxes work, they look at\na tax -- an apportioned share of the worldwide income\nof the business.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then all the --\nbut all you're saying -- but you have to do business in\nthe State with the lower income tax rate to get the\nadvantage of the lower rate.\nMR. ENRICH: Yes. If you're not doing\nbusiness in the State, then you will not pay any tax.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that --\nMR. ENRICH: If --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- would seem to\npresent the same Commerce Clause problem that you're\nposing for us today.\nMR. ENRICH: Well, Your Honor, a business\nthat doesn't have a business presence in the State of\nOhio will not pay any Ohio tax. It is not subject to\nany burden. It is not discriminated against in any\nway. That's the same situation for the property tax.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Likewise, a business that\ndoes not locate in Ohio is not subject to the -- to the\nhigher Ohio tax, which has been reduced for them.\nMR. ENRICH: Yes, Your Honor. The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, they're --\nMR. ENRICH: -- discrimination --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- they're exempt from it\nentirely, which is even better, I suppose.\nMR. ENRICH: Yes, Your Honor. The\ndiscrimination here is not between those businesses\nwhich are not present at all in Ohio and those which\nare doing their manufacturing in Ohio, the\ndiscrimination is between those who are doing business\nin Ohio, but not locating their new manufacturing\nactivity in Ohio, and those who do business in Ohio,\nbut do locate their new manufacturing activity. This\nis the same situation that the Court has confronted\nover and over again. In Boston Stock, the\ndiscrimination only affected those purchasers or\nsellers of stock where the transactions had sufficient\nnexus with New York to be subject to New York's tax.\nThe problem was that, of that universe of transactions,\nthe ones where the sale was made on a New York exchange\nwere subjected to a lower rate of tax than the ones\nthat were transacted on an out-of-State exchange.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was the legislation that\nestablished this tax benefit -- was it controversial?\nWere there those who opposed it as a giveaway to --\nMR. ENRICH: Your Honor, the record does not\ndisclose what the political context was in Ohio at the\ntime that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they --\nMR. ENRICH: -- that this was enacted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I have -- I will take\njudicial cognizance of the fact that such proposals are\nsometimes politically controversial. Isn't that the\nplace to fight out this thing? Isn't your basic\nobjection here that you don't agree that a State should\ngive tax credits to business, and that's something\nthat, you know, is in the political arena, and let the\npeople fight it out?\nMR. ENRICH: Justice Scalia, our objection --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why should that be an issue\nthat a court should decide?\nMR. ENRICH: -- our objection is that when\nStates use discriminatory tax measures as a way to\nprovide tax benefits to those businesses that locate in\nthe jurisdiction, that it leads to a competition\nbetween the States that ends up hurting taxpayers, like\nRespondents here, by reducing the ability of the States\nto generate tax revenues from business.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but what you call --\nMR. ENRICH: This Court has --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- what you call\ndiscrimination is any differential. In fact, in this\ncase, the effective tax differential is a quid pro quo\nfor an investment. And, basically, your argument boils\ndown to saying that there's discrimination whenever the\nState offers a quid pro quo for an advantage and\nsomebody decides not to take advantage of it.\nMR. ENRICH: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's not discrimination.\nThat is simply the effect of a free choice, and any\nbusiness is free to make that choice.\nMR. ENRICH: Your Honor, we would suggest\nthat that is exactly the situation in many of the cases\nthat this Court has previously struck down as facially\ndiscriminatory tax provisions. In Bacchus Imports,\nanyone could move to Hawaii and produce pineapple wine\nand receive the benefit of the tax exemption. In\nBoston Stock, anyone could make their transactions on\nthe New York exchanges, rather than an out-of-State\nexchange, and get the benefit of the lower rate.\nWhat this Court has consistently said is,\nwhen the benefit that is given is -- takes the form of\na credit, an exemption, a reduction in a tax which\napplies to out-of-State businesses, transactions, and\nactivities, that that constitutes the kind of\ndiscrimination --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh.\nMR. ENRICH: -- that the Commerce Clause\nforbids.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I could -- I could see your\nargument, if, for example, in the tax exchange case,\nthere was not taxation being made of the out-of-State\ntransactions. But that was the case in --\nMR. ENRICH: Yes. And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the tax. And there is --\nthere's no such parallel here.\nMR. ENRICH: Yes, Your Honor, there is a very\nprecise parallel here. The corporate income tax\nimposed by Ohio applies to any business that transacts\nbusiness in Ohio, whether or not it has manufacturing\npresence.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you the same\nquestion I asked your adversary? Suppose, instead of a\ntax credit, they said, \"We'll pay for the construction\ncost of a building, or we'll give you a piece of real\nestate, in order to get you to come in. Part of big\nredevelopment progress\" --\nMR. ENRICH: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- \"program, we would give\nyou this parcel of real estate.\" Would that also be\nsubject to the same analysis?\nMR. ENRICH: No, Your Honor, it would not.\nAs this Court has suggested, as far back as Hughes v.\nAlexandria Scrap, when the State is essentially acting\nas a participant in the market, deploying its own\nresources --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, they wouldn't be acting\n-- other than the one transaction, \"We'll give you one\nparticular benefit in this new development progress --\nproject, with no further participation as a market\nparticipant or anything like that,\" that would -- it\nseems to me that would fit right into your analysis.\nMR. ENRICH: Well, in terms of its economic\neffect, it would, Your Honor, but this Court, in cases\nlike Camps Newfoundland, has recognized a significant\ndistinction between cash subsidies, on the one hand,\nand tax benefits, on the other, largely because the tax\nthat is reduced is a tax which does involve an exercise\nof what this Court has called \"a primeval governmental\nactivity,\" and constitutes a kind of regulation which\nbrings it within the scope of the Dormant Commerce\nClause; whereas, in -- ordinarily, a direct subsidy\npaid out of the general funds of the State does not\ninvolve any such regulatory impact on interstate\ncommerce.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But in terms of\ndiscrimination and economic impact, they really are the\nsame?\nMR. ENRICH: Yes, Your Honor. In fact,\nthere's a wide, wide continuum. At the one end, there\nis the standard -- the pure tariff. On the other end,\nthere is providing training for workers or\ninfrastructure for a plant. This Court has clearly\nrecognized that tariffs are unconstitutional. There is\nno suggestion that providing training or infrastructure\nwould be. All of those have the same economic effect.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but they're -- what our\nopinions hold are that there are some matters of\nproducing the same result as a cash subsidy --\nMR. ENRICH: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that are no good, but\nthere are other matters that are perfectly okay.\nMR. ENRICH: That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the mere fact that it\nhas the same effect as a cash subsidy is not a problem,\nas far as the Commerce Clause is concerned. And what\nyou're arguing here is, the mere fact that it has that\neffect of favoring businesses that choose to locate in\nOhio is what makes it bad, not the fact that it's\nrelieving, from a tax that applies to both in-State and\nout-of-State businesses, only in-State business.\nThat's -- that was the Hawaii case, and all the other\ncases you cite. But what your argument here is that\nthe mere fact of providing a subsidy violates the\nCommerce Clause. And I don't know --\nMR. ENRICH: No, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- any case --\nMR. ENRICH: -- what we're suggesting is that\na measure which has the identical effect, and is\nstructured very much like a provision which applies a\ntax to those businesses who engage in out-of-State\nactivity, while excusing from tax those businesses that\nengage in in-State activity, is a tariff, by another\nname. And this provision, as --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Except the criterion is not\nmere in-State activity. The criterion is a particular\nin-State activity, an investment, as to which the\ncredit is a quid pro quo. And the opportunity to make\nthat investment is open to every business, presently\nin-State, presently out-of-State, no matter where\ndomiciled.\nMR. ENRICH: Yes, Your Honor. And, in that\nrespect, this is no different than, for instance, the\nWestinghouse Electric case, which granted -- which\nstruck down a grant of a credit against a corporate\nincome tax that was available to any business that\nchose to locate some of its export activity in the\nState of New York. Again --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that tax did apply to\nout-of-State businesses --\nMR. ENRICH: It was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and they got no reduction\n--\nMR. ENRICH: It was exactly --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- right?\nMR. ENRICH: -- the same tax as the tax in\nquestion here, Your Honor. It was a corporate income\ntax apportioned on the basis of the ordinary three\nfactors that Ohio uses, on the basis of where the\ncompany's sales are located, where the company's\npayroll is located, where the company's property is\nlocated. The two taxes, in Westinghouse and here, were\nidentical. There were some small differences in\nexactly the way that the credit was structured, but the\nunderlying taxes were, in all respects, identical.\nThe problem that the Court recognized in\nWestinghouse is that by giving a credit that was\nrestricted to a particular kind of in-State activity,\nand not to its out-of-State counterpart, the State was\neffectively providing a benefit to in-State business\nand a burden on out-of-State business that constituted\nthe functional equivalent of a tariff, and the Court\nstruck it down. Now --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Some States --\nCounsel, some States have homestead exemptions to\nproperty taxes for people when they're buying homes in\nthe State. That -- those would be invalid under your\ntheory?\nMR. ENRICH: Your Honor, I don't believe that\nthey would be. Again, a homesteader who buys a\nproperty in another State is not going to owe any tax\nto --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but that --\nMR. ENRICH: -- Ohio.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that person may\nhave another piece of property in the -- in the other\nState.\nMR. ENRICH: But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And he's not getting\nthe benefit of this, because his homestead -- he lives\nsomewhere else.\nMR. ENRICH: Your Honor, we would suggest\nthat the question is whether the tax scheme in question\nin the State whose provision is being challenged\nimposes differential burdens on two different entities\nbased on where they locate some activity. In the case\nof the homestead exemption, the State offering the\nhomestead exemption is not saying, \"We'll tax you if\nyou locate outside the State.\" Perhaps some other\nState is taxing them. But, again, this Court has\nrepeatedly avoided judging the legitimacy of one\nState's tax by the question of what other States did.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they're two\nidentical pieces of property, and they'll say -- one\nsay, \"You're going to be taxed at a lower rate if\nthat's where you're living, if that's your homestead;\nbut if you happen to live outside the State, you're going\nto get taxed at a higher rate.\" It would seem to be\nvery similar to what you're challenging here.\nMR. ENRICH: Your Honor, maybe I'm not\nunderstanding your example. Are you imagining that the\nState that's offering the homestead exemption was\nimposing a tax on the property located outside the\nState?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it's imposing tax\non property in the State at a higher rate if it's not\nthe person's homestead; in other words, if they don't\nlive in the State.\nMR. ENRICH: Okay. So, that is a provision\nthat, I think, does raise at least some questions. It's one\nwhere I think there are strong justifications outside\nof the effect on interstate commerce that very well\nmight provide ample justification for it. It raises --\nand the question on which we have asked this Court to\ngrant cert about the property tax exemption raises\nprecisely the question of what sorts of conditions on a\nproperty tax exemption do, and what sorts do not,\nconstitute discrimination against interstate commerce.\nI would suggest that there would be ample opportunity\nto distinguish something like the homestead provision,\nwhich is directed at a quite different purpose than\nencouraging in-State economic activity from --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's the same\npurpose. There's some place -- they want people to\nmove in -- into the District here, for example, just\nlike Ohio wants businesses to move in.\nMR. ENRICH: I would suggest that the\nCommerce Clause is much more concerned with efforts to\nrelocate businesses than with efforts to protect\nindividuals from burdens of local property taxation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A lot of money in building\nhomes.\nMR. ENRICH: That is true, Your Honor.\nWe would suggest that that raises a very\ndifferent set of questions from the facially\ndiscriminatory distinction between out-of-State\nbusinesses who are subjected to the tax, in the case of\nthe Ohio investment tax credit, and in-State\nbusinesses, which are excused from paying that same\ntax, which is, again, exactly what a tariff does, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Olson, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 04-1704\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIn the first place, this is article III\nstanding that we're talking about, not prudential\nconsiderations of standing, as the Court made very\nclear in Valley Forge, where a taxpayer seeks to employ\na Federal court to air grievances about the conduct of\nGovernment or the allocation of power in the Federal\nsystem. The \"case and controversies\" requirement of\narticle III is not met.\nWith respect to the issue of municipal\ntaxpayer standing, the Court would have to determine\nthat that did exist, something that has not happened\nbefore, and then would piggyback onto that claim a\nchallenge to a separate tax by a separate Government\nunder a separate claim arising out of a separate\ntransaction. The deal between DaimlerChrysler and\nToledo was separate from the tax granted by the\ninvestment tax credit under the State's system.\nRespondents state, in the first page of their\nbrief, that, because all of these States do these\nthings, these investment tax credits have only minimal\neffect on business transactions. That's the first page\nof their brief. That's harmful to their standing,\nthat's harmful to their Commerce Clause challenge.\nOhio only taxes in-State activity. It uses a\nconstitutionally appropriate apportionment formula to\ndetermine how much of the interstate business's\nactivity is attributable to Ohio, and only taxes that.\nSo that if there is a benefit given because someone\ncomes to the State and builds a plant there, it may\nresult, actually, in increased taxes in Ohio, because\nthe plant will raise the proportion of business being\ndone in Ohio. But what Ohio does not do is -- what\nthis Court has held unconstitutional -- is, tax the\nout-of-State activity, or burden the out-of-State\nactivity, or make interstate commerce itself more\nburdensome.\nAs the Court has pointed out in questions,\nJustices have pointed out in questions, this same issue\ncould be raised with respect to the State of Nevada.\nThere's no franchise tax in the State of Nevada, and\nsame with other States. Some States offer accelerated\npermitting requirements or relaxed environmental rules\nor different educate -- employment standards, all\nmatters of State regulation. This Court has said that\ncompetition between States for commerce lies at the\nheart of a free-trade society. That is what's going on\nhere. States are competing with appropriate permissive\nincentives to do business within the State. This is,\nas this Court said, a laudable purpose for State\nactivity.\nWhat the Respondents would do would\nnationalize State tax systems. You couldn't have a\nmore beneficial tax system in Massachusetts than in\nOhio, because that would provide some sort of a burden,\nunder the Respondent's theory. The same with other\nregulations by States of business. We would have a\nsystem where this Court would be deciding -- all States\nwould have to have uniform taxation, uniform systems of\nregulations, the very antithesis of federalism.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you have --\nMR. OLSON: Now, what I would --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- dog license -- dog\nlicense costs $10, but you have to pay 20 if you invest\nnext time in Wisconsin.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: By the way, we're not going\nto do it that way, we're just going to say you pay\nhalf.\nMR. OLSON: If you have your dog in\nWisconsin, you may pay whatever --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no.\nMR. OLSON: -- Wisconsin decides --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. But, you see -- but my\npoint is --\nMR. OLSON: If --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- separate tax in Ohio, and\nwe're going to double it, though, if your next\ninvestment is in some --\nMR. OLSON: That would be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- other State.\nMR. OLSON: That would be something this\nCourt would be severely concerned with.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Correct. Now, all we do is,\nwe say, \"We're not going to double it. You're going to\npay the same. But everybody invests here, pays half.\"\nMR.

And\nthis is important with respect to businesses in the\nUnited States competing with foreign countries.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't believe in\nharmonization, Mr. Olson?\n[Laughter.]\nMR.
