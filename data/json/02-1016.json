        "content": "(11:12 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 02-1016, Lee Till v. SCS Credit Corporation.\nMs. Harper.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF REBECCA J. HARPER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. HARPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nDeferred payments under section\n1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) must equal the present value of the\ncollateral. Historically present value has been an\nobjective concept equalling the real interest rate and\ninflation, which is the time value of money.\nThe Seventh Circuit has redefined this concept\nin a manner that seriously disrupts two fundamental\nprinciples of chapter 13, that being the equal treatment\nof creditors similarly situated and the debtor's\nrehabilitation, the debtor's access to chapter 13.\nQUESTION: When you say traditionally it's been\nunderstood to mean real interest rate plus time value of\nmoney, it means real interest rate for the particular\nlender. Isn't -- I mean, the -- the interest rate that is\ngiven to different lenders is not always the same.\nMS. HARPER: Under chapter 13, you're simply\ntrying to value the money. It's not particular to a\nspecific creditor because you're just trying to equate the\namount of money over time to a particular amount of the\nallowed secured claim.\nQUESTION: Well, that's right, but the interest\nrate that I have to pay when I buy a house with a very\nsmall down payment is much higher than the interest I have\nto pay if I make a much larger down payment.\nMS. HARPER: That's --\nQUESTION: And the interest I have to pay, if I\nmake, you know, over $200,000 a year is less than I would\nget if I have a lower income. So you can't just speak of\na fair interest rate in the abstract as though it's a --\nit -- it's a platonic number floating out there. It\ncertainly depends upon the solvency and -- and the record\nof payment of the person paying the interest. Isn't that\nright? I --\nMS. HARPER: You're -- you're talking about\ninterest in the open market, though, which is not what\nwe're talking about here. We're -- we're talking more\nabout --\nQUESTION: I'm surprised to hear you saying this\nbecause I thought your brief acknowledged that even after\nyou begin with the -- with a discount rate, you know, the\n-- the Fed's discount rate -- I thought your briefs\nacknowledged that the bankruptcy court could add to that a\n-- a surcharge depending upon the riskiness of the chapter\n13 debtor.\nMS. HARPER: That --\nQUESTION: You didn't acknowledge that? I\nthought your brief acknowledged that. I'm -- you -- you\nreally want to use the discount rate, period, and nothing\n-- nothing tagged on top of it.\nMS. HARPER: I was going to get to that, but in\ncertain circumstances an additional risk factor may be\nrequired, but it is our position that there are many other\nstatutory elements under -- provisions under chapter 13\nthat cover the types of risks that would normally be\nincluded in a contract, for instance.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I think the same thing\nthat's bothering Justice Scalia, or that prompted his\nquestion in any event, is -- is troubling me. When I -- I\nread the briefs, I -- I thought that the coerced loan\napproach, which you object to, did have certain\ndeficiencies, because you had to have testimony what the\ninterest rate is, you have to conform it to the particular\ntransaction, it's hard to administer. I frankly don't see\nhow yours is much different because you add a premium to\nthe prime rate. What is that premium going to be? Why\nshouldn't it depend on the transaction? Why shouldn't it\ndepend on the risk of default? Why doesn't your approach\nhave all of the same problems as the coerced loan\napproach?\nMS. HARPER: Because you need to limit the\npurpose of that premium. Most risk elements are\nencompassed within other sections of chapter 13 because\nyour normal risk of deterioration of the collateral, for\ninstance -- that's adequate protection. So you don't have\nto add on for that. You don't have -- the risk of default\nis covered by the fact that there is a wage assignment in\neffect.\nI'm saying that in certain instances --\nQUESTION: Well, but if that was true, you could\nbring up the same thing when you're cross-examining the\nexpert on the coerced loan approach and say, well, we\ndon't want 21 percent because there's a wage assignment.\nIt's the same answer.\nMS. HARPER: No. The 21 percent, such as the 21\npercent that was in this record, there was no support for\nat all. The creditor did not show any basis for --\nQUESTION: It showed what the creditor had been\ngetting before, and that, I thought, was the argument,\nthat in -- out of chapter 17 -- 13, in chapter 13 our\ncontract rate was 21 percent, and that represents what it\nwould cost this borrower if he were today to take those\nfunds, get the same funds. It would cost him 21 percent\nbecause he's a high-risk borrower. That's -- that's the\ntheory. But you're saying that that is a wrong theory, as\nJudge Rovner said in her opinion, but it's -- it's not\nbecause it's more difficult to apply than some other\ntheory.\nMS. HARPER: Well --\nQUESTION: I think you're -- you're saying that\nthat's a wrong approach, and maybe you'll say why.\nMS. HARPER: Yes. It's the wrong approach\nbecause the only thing that the creditor is entitled to\nprotection for under 1325 is the value of the collateral.\nIn that 21 percent contract rate, first of all, on the\nrecord in this case the expert couldn't even say what it\nconsisted of. But in your typical contract rate of\ninterest, you're going to have transaction charges.\nYou're going to have the risk of default, which has\nalready occurred here, the risk of bankruptcy default, for\ninstance. That risk has already occurred here. The\ncreditor has already been compensated for that.\nQUESTION: You think that makes this a better --\na better borrower? It -- it makes it a safer loan when\nyou're -- when you're -- you're owed money by somebody who\nhas already been through bankruptcy once? You think\nyou're in better shape?\nMS. HARPER: In many --\nQUESTION: Gee, that's -- that's a novel\napproach.\nMS. HARPER: In many respects, it is safer\nbecause here you're talking about a subprime lender who\ndid enter into a contract where it assumed a great amount\nof risk, but now the debtor's debt structure, his payment\nobligations have been modified by the chapter 13.\nQUESTION: So you think a lender has two\ndifferent loan candidates in front of him, one he thinks\nis going to go through bankruptcy and the other he thinks\nis not, so he's going to give the loan to the first one?\nMS. HARPER: I think that --\nQUESTION:\nme to assume.\nMS. HARPER: -- a lender may charge additional\ninterest if -- under State law if the lender has\nindication that the debtor may go through bankruptcy, but\nnormally in the subprime market, that's all factored in\nbecause most subprime candidates are candidates for\npossible bankruptcy in the future.\nQUESTION: Is it a fact that most chapter 13\nbankrupts don't make it to the end of the program?\nMS. HARPER: Well --\nQUESTION: In fact, the vast majority fail.\nMS. HARPER: That's not necessarily true when\nyou talk --\nQUESTION: I thought we had statistics on that.\nMS. HARPER: The problem is most of the\nstatistics focus on the default rate just from the filing,\nthe number of filings. They don't focus on the default\nrate after the chapter 13 has been confirmed because there\nare many -- the case by that point has been reviewed by\nthe court and it's determined to have been feasible. The\ndebtor by that point has been making payments for a\nsubstantial period.\nQUESTION: Are there statistics on that kind of\ncases that you're describing now?\nMS. HARPER: There -- I have found limited\nstatistics. One study that I found said that 63 percent\nof the chapter 13's completed successfully after they\nreached the point of confirmation. So there is suggestion\nthat after the point of confirmation, the success rate\ngets much higher, which only makes sense because a lot of\ntimes --\nQUESTION: It's still not a very good risk. I\nmean, you --\nMS. HARPER: Well --\nQUESTION: -- you lend money to somebody. Your\nchances of getting it back are 2 out of 3?\nMS. HARPER: The subprime lender's risk in the\nopen market is not good either. So --\nQUESTION: Well, I think it's better than 2 out\nof 3.\nMS. HARPER: It's five times higher than the\nprime market.\nQUESTION: Let -- let me ask you a -- the -- the\nway I see these two approaches. I'm assuming that -- that\nyou're -- you're willing to allow over the prime rate some\naddition which the -- the courts that -- that follow your\n-- your favored approach do allow for risk factor. So\nunder your theory, you take the prime rate, and then it is\nup to the bankruptcy judge to assess what the risk is,\nsomething that I think judges are probably not very well\nqualified to do.\nYou know when -- when you pick the prime rate,\nthat that's not the market rate. It obviously isn't. So\nit's well below the market rate. I mean, here you had a\n21 percent loan and you're going to take what? I don't\nknow. A prime rate of 8 percent at most? You know it's\nwrong. And then the bankruptcy judge has to make it\nright. Okay?\nUnder the other approach, you take the market\nrate, the rate that was actually adopted between these --\nthese two people operating in a free market. Now, it --\nit may be -- may be high, it may be low. You don't know\nfor sure that it's either one. It's -- it's -- it may be\naccurate. It is not surely inaccurate the way picking the\nprime is. And then the adjustment to be made by the\nbankruptcy judge is much less. If there are some special\nfactors that show a lesser risk now than there was when\nthe loan was originally made, he might take them into\naccount.\nNow, as I see it, the less discretion that is\nleft to the bankruptcy judge and the more weight that is\ngiven to the -- to the real forces of the operating\nmarket, the better off we are. I -- I don't think that\nbankruptcy judges are very good risk calculators.\nMS. HARPER:\nthat a chapter 13 has been filed and that there are\ncertain minimal requirements for chapter 13 confirmation.\nA -- and the problem is that market rate, the way these\ncourts have defined it -- has come to mean anything and\neverything. We're talking about two different market\nrates here.\nQUESTION: I'm talking about using the rate of\nthe loan that was actually made.\nMS. HARPER: But there is nothing in the statute\nthat requires the creditor to be compensated for all of\nthose items that were included in the pre-petition\ncontract.\nQUESTION: No, but he has to be given the\ncurrent value of his security and the current value of his\nsecurity, which is not going to be received 20 years from\nnow or 5 years from now, depends upon how much of a credit\nrisk there is that that money will actually be paid.\nMS. HARPER: How could the -- how could you\npossibly contract in advance for the present value of this\nparticular allowed secured claim, $4,000? That amount\nwasn't even known when the contract rate was established.\nThe contract rate was based upon particular\ncharacteristics of the creditor and the debtor and many --\nQUESTION: In -- in an open market. And if the\ndebtor could have gotten -- it's a very competitive\nmarket, as I understand it. And if the debtor could have\ngotten a lower rate elsewhere, he presumably would have.\nMS. HARPER: That's --\nQUESTION: I'm just saying that that's -- that\nthat's a reasonable starting point. Now, if there has to\nbe an adjustment because market rates have gone down since\nthen, that minor adjustment can be made, but that's going\nto be much less of an adjustment than you're going to have\nto leave to the bankruptcy judge if you begin with the\nprime rate which you know is wrong. You know that nobody\nwould have made this -- this car loan at the prime rate.\nMS. HARPER: That's not the question. The\nquestion is not what someone would make a new loan for\nbecause an allowed secured claim in chapter 13 is a claim.\nIt's not a loan. Once the bankruptcy is filed --\nQUESTION: Let me ask you this -- this piece of\nit. The -- Justice Scalia said to give this kind of you-\npick-it discretion to the bankruptcy judge is a worrisome\nthing, but all of the cases that take this approach, the\nTreasury bill approach or the prime, seem to have a rather\nnarrow range for that risk factor. They go from 1 percent\nto 3 percent, and none of them go over 3 percent. Where\ndid they -- where did that range -- who invented that\nrange that 3 percent would be the ceiling?\nMS. HARPER: That's a good question. I believe\nthat it just results from the fact that in your typical\nchapter 13, you don't have a lot of special risk that has\nto be compensated for because you usually have the fixed\nasset, there's no hazard -- hazardous use, you've got a\nwage assignment. You -- substantial risk might result,\nfor instance, in a chapter 13 if you had a balloon\npayment.\nQUESTION: A what payment?\nMS. HARPER: A balloon payment instead of\nperiodic weekly payments, which is usually what you have\nin a chapter 13.\nQUESTION: As I understand it, your expert in\nthis case, your economist, testified that the prime rate\nwas 8 percent and that in his view a reasonable risk\npremium would be 1.5. But he conceded under cross-\nexamination that he was unfamiliar with the relevant rates\nof default or costs of servicing loans in the subprime\nmarket, which --\nMS. HARPER: That's --\nQUESTION: -- to my mind is conceding that he\nhas no basis for picking 1.5 percent.\nMS. HARPER: That 1.5 in that case was actually\na local bankruptcy rule. But that same expert also\ntestified that prime already includes 2 percent which\ncould not be accounted for except for risk and transaction\nfees.\nQUESTION: The risk -- the risk of a prime\nborrower, of a fat cat borrower.\nMS. HARPER: But, again, we're not talking about\nborrowing on a new loan in a chapter 13. The -- we're\ntalking about modification to an old loan, an existing\nloan. 1322(b)(2) allows you to modify that contract. So\nwe're not looking at what this debtor would have to pay in\nthe open market were it not for the chapter 13. That's\nnot the proper inquiry.\nIf there are no further questions, I would\nreserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Ms. Harper.\nMr. Salmons, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SALMONS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe court of appeals here held that the\nbankruptcy courts are required to presume that the pre-\nbankruptcy contract rate of interest, which varies from\ncreditor to creditor and could range anywhere from 0 to 40\npercent or more in some jurisdictions, is the appropriate\ndiscount rate to use in calculating the present value of\nplan payments under section 1325. Now, that approach is\nmistaken, we submit, for three principal reasons.\nFirst, it violates the core bankruptcy principle\nof equality of distribution for similarly situated\ncreditors. Under the court of appeals' approach, two\ncreditors could make car loans to the same debtor that\nresulted in allowed secured claims of equal value, and yet\none would receive thousands more in plan payments solely\nbecause the other made its car loan at a time when the\ndebtor's financial troubles had not yet become obvious.\nQUESTION: Is that right? I just want to be\nsure I understand the -- the point. I thought if you had\nthat differential before the bankruptcy judge, it's a --\nthe original is a presumptive risk, and the judge could\nthen resolve it by maybe compromising between the two.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, this is an important\npoint because I think there is some misconception about\nwhat the court of appeals held in this case, and I think\nthat's due in part to the fact that respondents, at least\nas I read their position, are not really defending the\napproach taken by the court of appeals. The court of\nappeals did not adopt a presumption in favor of the pre-\nbankruptcy contract rate because it thought that that\nrepresented accurately the relevant market, if you will,\nfor the risks of -- and benefits and protections that\nexist under the Bankruptcy Code.\nIn fact, under the court of appeals' approach,\nthe risk of nonpayment is really irrelevant. What the\ncourt of appeals says is that because the -- the creditor\nis denied use of funds for the period of the payment plan,\nthat it therefore is entitled to whatever rate it would\nhave gone out and funded a new loan at if it had been\nallowed to foreclose and reinvest the proceeds. Now --\nQUESTION: I agree with you, and -- and the\nrespondent is not defending that approach, but rather the\napproach that you use the rate of the -- of the original\nloan as the starting point, and then adjust it as\nnecessary.\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct, and I just want to\nemphasize, though, that -- that the adjustment that the\ncourt of appeals would make is not one I think that\nanybody before the Court now would defend because the\ncourt of appeals would adjust only if you could prove that\nthe -- a particular secured creditor is now making loans\nat some other rate and there's no reason to think why that\nhas anything to do with what the present value of plan\npayments would be under 1325. And -- and the problem --\nQUESTION: So, but you're saying -- but you're\nsaying that under the respondent's view, that -- that the\ncreditors would be treated differently?\nMR. SALMONS: If respondent's view is that you\nshould have a presumption in favor of the pre-bankruptcy\ncontract rate, then that would be the result. What's not\nclear to me is whether it's actually respondent's view\nthat you should have a presumption in favor of the\nsubprime contract rate or the highest contract rate\nallowed by State law because it's important to remember\nthat pre-bankruptcy contract rates are going to vary. You\ncould have a 0 percent lender. You could have a prime\nlender, and you could have a subprime lender. And there's\nno reason to think that any one of those necessarily\ncaptures the unique mix of risks and benefits and\nprotections that exist under the Bankruptcy Code.\nQUESTION: Where do you get the principle that\nall secured creditors have to be treated equally? Where\ndoes -- where does that appear?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, Your Honor, on -- I would\nrefer you to page 19 --\nQUESTION: I'm sure it's true of all unsecured\ncreditors. I -- I don't know why --\nQUESTION: Page 19 of what?\nMR. SALMONS: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I would\nrefer you to page 19 of the Government's brief where we\nrefer to two cases by this Court, Bigeur v. the IRS and --\nand Union Bank v. Wolas, that stand for the principle that\n-- that embody the notion that equality of distribution\namong creditors is a central policy of the Bankruptcy\nCode. That's this Court's language.\nQUESTION: Similarly situated creditors.\nMR. SALMONS: To be sure, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Not secured versus unsecured.\nMR. SALMONS: That's why I gave the example that\nI did of two creditors that extend car loans and the only\ndifference between them -- they have the exact same\nallowed value under the code for their claim. The only\ndifference between them is that one made its loan 2 years\nprior to bankruptcy when the -- when the debtor's credit\nhistory was not quite as bad and the other made it 2 weeks\nbefore bankruptcy when the only rate the debtor could get\nis --\nQUESTION: Well, why isn't that a valid\ndistinction?\nMR. SALMONS: Because, Your Honor, from the\nstandpoint of section 1325(a)(5), the relevant inquiry is\nwhat is the present value of the promised future payments\nfrom the debtor. All creditors are now facing the exact\nsame situation, and I think respondent concedes this. And\nthose are the risks of inflation, the time value of money,\nand the risk that particular payments may not be made\nunder a plan. And there's no reason to think --\nQUESTION: Well, and the risk --\nMR. SALMONS: -- that those are different for\ncreditors --\nQUESTION: The risk of the security will just\ndisappear too, you know, be totally devalued.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I don't think that's\nembodied in section 1325(a)(5). If anything, that's\ncaptured in the higher replacement value standard for the\nvaluing of the underlying claim that this Court adopted in\nRash. And I would add that -- that one reason to think\nwhy the discount rate here doesn't need to go too far in\ntaking risks of nonpayment into account is that this Court\nin Rash adopted the underlying value here, replacement\nvalue, that's typically significantly higher than what\nthe --\nQUESTION: What has that to do with it? I don't\nsee what that has to do with it at all.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, Your Honor, what --\nQUESTION: I mean, the reason I say that is I\nthought we were following a statute, and what the statute\ntells us is that the value of what they receive has to\nequal $4,000. They receive a set of promises to pay so\nmuch a month and the right to repossess if those promises\nare not kept. Now, that's what the statute tells us to\ndo. So let's do it.\nthe $4,000?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, my only point is that\nthis Court in Rash noted that the higher replacement --\nQUESTION: Whatever it said in Rash, reading the\nstatute, unless they actually contradicted that, doesn't\nthe statute say what I just said? So the problem in the\ncase is how do we value the stream of payments plus the\nrepossession value?\nMR. SALMONS: I think --\nQUESTION: I would have thought that that kind\nof thing is something bankruptcy judges are paid to make\njudgments about all the time.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, I -- I generally agree with\n-- with Your Honor's statement. What -- what I would add,\nthough, is that the dispute in this case is not -- I mean,\nit's undisputed that inflation and the time value of money\nhave to be taken into account under -- under the discount\nrate. The only question is whether you have to take into\naccount the risks of nonpayment. We submit that there --\nQUESTION: Of course, you do. Of course, you\ndo. There is a risk of nonpayment and anything that\ndidn't take that into account would not be equating the\nproperty with the $4,000.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, if -- if this Court\nbelieves that risks of nonpayment need to be taken into\naccount, then we submit that the best way to do that is to\nstart with a market indicator such as the prime rate that\ncaptures the time value of money and the risk of inflation\nand then -- then allow -- and -- and some risk of\nnonpayment, and then allow the bankruptcy court, which --\nwhich, by the way, has just made a determination under\n1325(a)(6) about the likelihood that -- that the payments\nwill be made. And it has made --\nQUESTION: Start with a figure that you know for\nsure is wrong. You know for sure that this person who got\na 21 percent car loan because he was a bad credit risk was\nnever going to get the prime rate of 8 percent.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Why begin with -- with something --\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, the answer to your\nquestion --\nQUESTION: -- that you know is going to be\nabysmally low except for the fact that it will mean less\nmoney for the secured creditors and more money for the\nunsecured creditors, among whom is often numbered the\nUnited States?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor -- Your Honor, the\nanswer to your question --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SALMONS:\nbecause there is no rate you can find that -- that\nprecisely reflects the unique mix of risks and benefits\nand protections that are available under the Bankruptcy\nCode. And so by definition, everyone here is talking\nabout a proxy in some form or another.\nNow, what the prime rate does do is is it\naccurately captures the time value of money and inflation.\nNow, we submit that the bankruptcy court, which has just\nexamined the plan -- it has made a determination. In\nfact, it has found that the payments -- that the debtor\nwill be able to make the payments under the plan -- that\nbankruptcy court is in the best position to make a\ndetermination about plan-specific risks of nonpayment if\nthose risks are going to be included. And that's a much\nmore efficient system than forcing the bankruptcy court to\ngo out and try and find some -- some elusive market that\n-- that would serve as a proxy for that determination.\nQUESTION: Well, you could ask them to just look\nat the contract rate and, if need be, make some adjustment\nto that because of the fact that they won't have to --\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: -- go through the collection process.\nMR. SALMONS: -- the difficulty with the\ncontract rate approach is that it varies from creditor to\ncreditor, and there really is no reason to think that --\nthat either secured creditors, or unsecured creditors for\nthat matter, for purposes of -- of this case, should be\ntreated differently. They all face the exact same risks\nof nonpayment, the exact same problems of inflation and\ntime value of money. They are similarly situated.\nQUESTION: In this case, as I understand it,\nthis lender always charged 21 percent. It didn't differ\nfrom -- from lender -- borrower to borrower. Every one of\nthem was charged 21 percent. That was the market.\nMR. SALMONS: And -- and another secured\ncreditor may have made a loan prior to that at a prime\nrate to the same debtor, and it always charges the prime\nrate, neither of which is particularly relevant to the\nquestion of what's the value of the promised payments\nunder the plan.\nQUESTION: But if the second one was so stupid\nas to do that, why should he be protected?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, Your Honor, it's not a\nmatter of stupidity. It's a matter of the fact that a\ndebtor's position changes over time and that what may be a\ngood rate 2 years out from bankruptcy and that is still\nowed would not be the rate you'd give immediately before\nbankruptcy. And it may not be the relevant risks of\nnonpayment that exist under bankruptcy.\nThe point is that -- is that as -- as this Court\nunderstood in Rash, the -- the creditor is entitled to the\nvalue of its allowed secured claim, and this Court noted\nin Rash that already compensates significant risks of\nnonpayment.\nNow, I would add, if I may --\nQUESTION: Because if this had been foreclosure\nvalue, then if we were going through this exercise, well,\nthe creditor would -- would then sell the asset and -- and\ncharge a -- a new borrower with the same rate of interest.\nBut the asset would be worth much less than the price --\nMR. SALMONS: That -- that's correct, and Your\nHonor, I would add that in fact we think it's possible to\nread the statute so there's no risk of nonpayment at all\nbecause the statute refers to property to be distributed\nunder the plan, and it requires the bankruptcy court to\nmake a finding that the debtor will be able to make\npayments. And there's no guidance whatsoever that would\ngive bankruptcy courts a way to do anything more, and so\nwe think in fact that an appropriate rate could even be\nthe Treasury bill rate which --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Salmons.\nMR. SALMONS: -- excludes that.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Brunstad, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe formula approach is surely inaccurate. It\nsystematically under-values the true risks and costs of a\nchapter 13 promise of repayment. We know at best\nstatistically that chapter 13 debtors at best have a 40\npercent rate of -- of payment on the plans.\nQUESTION: How -- how many default?\nQUESTION: Your -- your opponent says that the\n-- that that's -- if you're taking after the thing is\nconfirmed, after -- that it's a 63 percent.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Your Honor. There -- there\nis one study that suggests that, but I must -- I must add\nthat -- that there are other studies that say that the\nsuccessful completion rate is as low as 3 percent in some\njurisdictions. Some 97 percent of chapter 13 fail.\nQUESTION: After confirmation.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Those are -- that's a total\nnumber, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay. That's the difference between\nyour statistics --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- and hers.\nQUESTION: Since -- and since this is an after-\nconfirmation case, why -- why don't we take that\npercentage?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Your Honor, giving them the\nbenefit of the doubt, we -- the best we can say, based\nupon what we know, is approximately a 63 percent success\nrate.\nQUESTION: After --\nQUESTION: What do you say to Mr. Salmons'\nargument that in fact the -- the plan is not supposed to\nbe confirmed unless the judge makes a -- a determination\nthat it can be followed, and it therefore isn't legitimate\nto take this kind of risk into consideration at all?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: It's what we call the feasibility\nstandard, Your Honor, and it applies in every single one\nof the reorganization chapters. The bankruptcy court must\nmerely determine that the bankruptcy judge feels that the\ndebtor will successfully complete the plan. We know,\nhowever, that given the extremely high rate of default in\nchapter 13, which far exceeds chapter 11, for example,\nthat the feasibility standard doesn't even come close to\nensuring --\nQUESTION: Well, how do we know how -- how many\n-- what's the percentage of people in this chapter that\ndefault within a year on -- on a payment of about $128 a\nmonth I guess, that was a small percentage of what they\nwere paying into the court? What's the figure?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, there are two sources. The\nbest statistics that I've been able to come up with is\nthat it's about a 60 percent failure rate.\nQUESTION: 60 percent fail within a year? You\nsaid that 40 percent failed overall.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: 60 percent fail within the 3- to\n5-year period.\nQUESTION: No. I asked you how many -- this is\n-- or let's take it then giving you the benefit of the\ndoubt. The payment plan was for 17 months. What is the\npercentage of people who fail to make a -- I guess it was\nabout 10 percent or 20 percent of the amount he was paying\ninto court. How many fail to make that kind of payment\nwithin 17 months?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: The statistics are not\ndisaggregated on that basis, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Correct. That's what I would think.\nSo what is wrong with us saying just by chance\nwhat the statute says? What the statute says is,\nbankruptcy judge, here's what you do. You create a stream\nof payments such that that stream of payments plus the\nvalue of the repossession equals $4,000. Now, that's your\njob. Go do it. So I would have thought, if I were the\nbankruptcy judge, the way I'd do it would be by looking to\nthe prime rate and then asking me -- asking you or others\nto tell me how much riskier this is than the prime rate,\nand I'd choose a number. And I can't imagine how we're\ngoing to come one whit closer than that general\ninstruction, but you'll tell me why it is possible to come\ncloser.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Your Honor, the contract rate is\nthe best evidence, the single best evidence of the market\nrate.\nQUESTION: Contract rate -- if there has to be a\nnumber that's wrong, it has to be that one.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But it is less --\nQUESTION: The contract rate by definition was\nentered into at some significant period of time prior to\nthe present, and the present, by chance in this instance,\nis 2 years later, and we know that interest rates fell at\nleast 1 or 2 percent during that time.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But not for subprime --\nQUESTION: So -- what?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But not for subprime loans.\nQUESTION: That's impossible. The prime rate --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor. This is why.\nQUESTION: If that's so, then the risk went up.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, that's not correct, Your\nHonor, and this is why.\nQUESTION: No. It isn't?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because State law caps the\nmaximum rate that can be paid.\nQUESTION: Oh, okay. Okay.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: So it increases the pool --\nQUESTION: All right. All right.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: -- of who can be lent to, but not\nthe rate.\nQUESTION: All right, because it's a usury\nproblem.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Correct.\nQUESTION: So -- so you would be free with your\nexperts to come in and say why it happens to be that the\nbankruptcy judge is wrong to take the prime rate and add a\nrisk factor, but ordinarily a contract entered into in\nadvance would not be good evidence of what the interest\nrate is today. Now, where am I wrong in that?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because, again, the contract rate\nis the best evidence of a market rate between this\nborrower and this lender with this particular --\nQUESTION: At a prior time.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: At a particular time --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: -- particularly if it's\ncontemporaneous to the filing. It reflects it and --\nQUESTION: Oh, yes, of course. I'm -- but I'm\n-- I'm simply saying isn't it true by definition that a\ncontract entered into at an earlier period of time where\ninterest rates fluctuate is not going to be very good\ninterest -- evidence of what that interest rate is today.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Your Honor, the contract\nrate is not perfect, but it's far superior to the formula\napproach, and what you see happening -- Justice Ginsburg,\nthe Second Circuit in the Valenti case came up with a 3-\npoint factor, just simply canvassing some lower court\ndecisions and decided prime rate plus 1, 2, or 3 points.\nIt's not based on any evidence. It's just simply based\nupon what the court felt was an appropriate range.\nQUESTION: Your --\nQUESTION: If you take Mr. Salmons' point that\nnow we're in bankruptcy, it's a different world, and we've\ngot one creditor -- let's say $4,000 is the principal for\nboth, but one lent at prime and one lent at subprime.\nOnce we're in the universe of bankruptcy, why shouldn't\nthose two lenders, both with $4,000 principals, be treated\nthe same?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: If their risks are different,\nthey should be treated differently, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But once you're in the bankruptcy,\nthe risk of getting back the $4,000 is the same for both\ncreditors, isn't it?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Not necessarily so, Your Honor.\nYou can take a situation. Say you have a hotel, a common\nasset in bankruptcy. The hotel may have a senior secured\ncreditor and a junior secured creditor. The number one\nsecured creditor's risks are materially less than the\njunior secured creditor's. They would be separately\nclassified. Because their risks are different, the\ninterest rates are different.\nIn this very case at page 12 of the joint\nappendix, you can see how the debtor broke down its four\nsecured creditors into four separate categories, and they\nhave different rates. Two secured creditors are offered\n9.5 percent and two are offered 0 percent interest for the\npayments the debtor is going to make.\nThe concept of equality of distribution is\nprecisely equality of distribution among similarly\nsituated creditors. Secured creditors are each unique by\ntheir own definition of the risks that they take. They\nhave collateral.\nQUESTION: And your response to Justice Breyer's\nquestion, as I understand it, is that 21 percent may not\nbe precisely what the rate is today for a loan made 3\nyears ago, but it's going to be a lot closer to it than 8\npercent is.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: That, plus the fact that the 21\npercent is often going to be actually too low to reflect\nthe actual risk being assumed.\nQUESTION: Well, that may be. Well, that may\nbe, but what I didn't understand about your answer is when\nyou said that the contract rate must be more accurate than\nthe formula.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: It seems to be.\nQUESTION: Since the formula by definition is\nperfect --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Since the formula is an instruction\nto equate the value of the stream of payments plus\nrepossession with $4,000, the formula by definition is\nperfect. So --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, why isn't it?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: The formula rate is essentially\nstandardless, and what we have seen how bankruptcy courts\napply the --\nQUESTION: You're saying I take -- you're saying\nthat --\nQUESTION: But yours is in theory perfect.\nQUESTION: Wait. No, no. Answer --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Imperfect. That's correct.\nQUESTION: No, no. Yours is in theory perfect\njust as -- as the formula is in theory perfect. In both\nof them you -- you begin with a starting point, and then\nyou make whatever adjustments the reality of the risk\nrequires. That brings you theoretically in both cases a\nperfect answer.\nThe only question is, as a practical matter,\nwhich of the two is likely to come closer to the correct\nanswer, starting with 8 percent that you know is way off\nthe mark and then letting the bankruptcy judge figure out\nhow much you add to that, or starting with 21 percent\nwhich, you know, is -- is -- it could be high, it could be\nlow. It's much fairer to both parties, but then let the\nbankruptcy judge adjust that a little bit. That's the\nquestion: what -- what the practical consequence is not\nthe -- the theoretical. They're both perfect\ntheoretically.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: In theory, Your Honor, yes, but\nwe must be faithful to is the statutory command. And here\nwhat we see happening is what happens in this case. A\nbankruptcy judge takes the formula approach, a --\nbasically a low rate, the prime rate, and is supposed to\nadjust it. And what do they do? Well, there's no\nevidence to support any adjustment in this particular\ncase.\nanything about the risks of these particular debtors.\nThere's no basis for the adjustment. The bankruptcy court\ndid what bankruptcy courts do in these cases; it simply\npicked a number.\nQUESTION: Well, couldn't the creditor have\nbrought in an expert?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: The creditor did bring in two\nwitnesses, and the witnesses testified that these\nparticular debtors with their particular credit histories\nwould be charged a 21 percent rate of interest.\nQUESTION: Well, can you tell me why is it that\nthe petitioners tell us that their standard is so much\neasier to administer? Is it because the courts aren't\nadministering it in the right way? As I listened to it,\nit seems to me I have two choices. I can begin with a low\nrate and add or I can begin with a high rate and -- and\nsubtract. Why -- why is one any more easy to administer\nthan -- than the other?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because --\nQUESTION: In fact, it -- it would seem to me --\nand this I suppose helps you -- that if the courts which\nare using the petitioners' formula are doing it the right\nway, it might even be harder to administer. They -- they\navoid that problem by just accepting some interest factor\nof 1 to 3 percent out of the blue although I don't know\nhow they do that.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Justice Kennedy, what we\nhave is we have three circuits which have adopted the\nformula approach, and so we have the experience of the\ncourts in those circuits, and we have the balance of the\ncircuits, approximately seven, that have taken more of the\nmarket rate approach. And what we see happening is that\nin those situations where the bankruptcy courts are\napplying the formula approach, they are systematically\ngiving chapter 13 debtors a rate of interest pretty close\nto prime. Now, that can't be correct. That gives the\ndebtors with the single highest default rate in bankruptcy\nthe lowest rates available in bankruptcy.\nQUESTION: Would it satisfy you if we said this?\nSuppose we said we see what we're after here. The\nobjective is to equate the stream of payments plus\nrepossession with $4,000. Now, on the one hand, we know\nit can't be lower than the prime. On the other hand, if\nthe creditor wants to come in and give a -- present his\nevidence, the contract, of how risky this person is, then\nin fact it is evidence absolutely. And the bankruptcy\njudge will look at it, and he'll try to figure out the\npluses and the minuses, what's happened to the interest\nrate, whether this particular person is a good or bad\nrisk, and he'll choose a number.\nlike that all the time?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: And apparently incorrectly\nsystematically in chapter 13 cases.\nQUESTION: But no. But does what I say satisfy\nyou?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor. And here's why.\nQUESTION: If not -- because?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Because the true market rate of\ninterest is almost always going to be at least the\ncontract rate, presumptive contract rate, because the\ncosts in chapter 13 are so much more extraordinarily\nhigher than the costs of collection outside of chapter 13.\nThe automatic stay stays in place for the duration of the\nplan. If you have a default, the secured party has to\ncome back to the bankruptcy court, hire an attorney, pay a\n$75 filing fee, argue the case. Bankruptcy judges\nroutinely give the debtor a second chance to cure the\ndefault. They have to come back. The costs of collection\n-- that's even before you get to foreclose on your\ncollateral. The costs of --\nQUESTION: But don't you get certain advantages?\nI mean, you do have the wage order. So there's a court\nsupervising that this wage -- every month that this\nperson, this borrower, is going to have to pay.\nAnd in the -- in -- in that setting you also\nhave -- going back to Rash, the one thing I don't\nunderstand about it because it seems you want to take it\nthe high side both ways. You've already been given the\nreplacement value rather than the foreclosure value.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So if we're going to do it your way\nand say, well, now, suppose the lender foreclosed on the\nasset, made a new loan at the 21 percent rate -- but you\nwould have to use not the replacement value, the higher\nvalue. You could only use what you could get on\nforeclosure if we follow your theory about we should make\nit just like you sold the asset, got money, and made a new\nloan. But the -- but you -- but the amount that you got\nwould be much less than the replacement value which is\nwhat you're getting inside the bankruptcy.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Your Honor, the secured creditor\nin the chapter 13 cramdown context is not trying to make\nany profit. It's simply trying to mitigate against the\nenormous losses that it suffers.\nQUESTION: But isn't that one of the adjustments\nthat would have to be made? You couldn't say adjust 20\npercent against $4,000. You'd have to say $4,000 minus\nbecause your foreclosure price is going to be much lower\nthan the replacement costs that you've got in the\nbankruptcy.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: But taking the extremely high\nrisks of default and the costs of actually having to\nforeclose in the chapter 13 context, the relevant market\nrate for the value of the stream of payments is always\ngoing to be at least the -- the pre-bankruptcy contract\nrate. In fact, it should --\nQUESTION: Mr. Brunstad --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- let me suggest a scary thought.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Is it -- is it possible that the\nstatute does not provide an answer to this question?\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: That since both of these schemes,\nyour proposal and the other side's proposal, are\ntheoretically perfect, if they are done correctly, the\nbankruptcy court is free to use either one so long as he\ncomes up with the right answer.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I mean, the only thing the statute\nsays is what -- what Justice Breyer keeps coming back to.\nYou have to provide him $4,000 in value.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor. The -- the\nbankruptcy statutes sometimes are obscure until we see\nwhere they come from, which is why we often look at their\nhistory. The master concept of cramdown is indubitable\nequivalence. It comes from Judge Hand's opinion in the\nMurel Holdings case. And the example in 1325(a)(5)(B)\nthat we're talking about is simply an example of\nindubitable equivalence. The secured party must be fully\ncompensated for the risk that it must assume. The concept\nof indubitable equivalence must be completely\ncompensatory. The secured party is not supposed to take\nuncompensated risk.\nQUESTION: Nobody is disagreeing with you about\nthat. That -- what we're -- I think what we're trying to\nget to -- it's a practical question. I actually think my\napproach is more perfect than Justice Scalia's perfect\napproach.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But the reason is it asks the right\nquestion.\nNow, what you're telling me is that by asking\nthe right question, the bankruptcy judges systematically\nhave not done it right. And -- and I see your point. So\n-- so what we're -- so we're trying to think of a form of\nwords we could say which would lead -- I can't say take\nthe contract rate because I know that must be wrong.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION:\nand go down, and then they'll have the same problem. I --\nI mean -- all right. But that's what we want them to do,\nis to honestly equate the value of the payments with the\n$4,000.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I think everybody wants that, and\nwe're searching -- at least I am -- for a way of how to do\nthat. You keep telling me you take contract rate. I hate\nto tell you I keep thinking no.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: As a presumptive rate, Your\nHonor. And it's important to understand just after this\nCourt's decision in Rash set the valuation standard for\nsetting the principal amount, what you see now is that\nsince we got the standard right, in 99 percent of the\ncases, the parties come to an agreement as to what the\nvalue of the collateral is. Once we get the standard\nright here, you should expect the same thing. It won't be\nlitigated over and over again.\nThe correct standard is I think to recognize,\nwhich I think Your Honor does, that this concept of\npresent value is an economic concept, not an equitable\none, and that essentially what we're doing is we're saying\nthere is a stream of payments to be made here and we have\nto figure out what it's worth. The best test for what\nit's worth would be what the market says.\nNow, the problem is, is that in chapter 11 there\nis a market. People do lend to chapter 11 debtors, and\nthe standard is the same in chapter 11 as 13: value as of\nthe effective date of the plan under 1129. So what we --\nwe have to be very careful about is in chapter 11, the\nmarkets do value debtors' promises to pay and they lend\nmoney and they charge very high interest rates. Exit\nlenders or finance lenders charge very high interest\nrates, 18, 19, 20 percent. It can't be true that in\nbankruptcy, in chapter 13, who are the riskiest chapter --\nriskiest debtors with the highest default rate, that we\nsystematically give them a rate which approaches prime.\nSo I think what you need to do, recognizing it's an\neconomic concept, is say what's the best evidence of a\nmarket rate.\nQUESTION: I understand. Tell me an -- a\nquestion I don't know the answer to.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: When -- when -- if you repossess --\nif he defaults again -- I mean, the first time he got into\nbankruptcy. Now, we've got the plan.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes.\nQUESTION: And suppose he doesn't make the\npayments on the truck. Does it then cost you a lot of\nmoney to go back even though you say to the judge, judge,\nthis is the second time? We'd like our truck now. It's\nonly worth $2,000 now. And you still have to pay the $75,\nget your witnesses and everything the second time?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: What happens the second time,\nYour Honor, is if the debtor defaults under the plan, the\nautomatic stay is still in effect. Unlike chapter 11\ncases, where the automatic stay terminates when the plan\nis confirmed or becomes effective, here the automatic stay\nstays in place until the end of the repayment period. So\nif the debtor defaults under the plan, someone has to go\nback to court and say, I need relief. I need relief from\nthe automatic stay to exercise my collection rights.\nA corporation like SCS can't go back to court\npro se. It needs a lawyer. You have to hire somebody to\ngo and represent them. You have to pay a filing fee.\nOftentimes the bankruptcy judge gives the debtor a second\nchance to cure the default under the plan. Then the\ndebtor says I'll cure, and then you come back a second\ntime, sometimes a third time, sometimes a fourth time,\nsometimes a fifth time, incurring costs at each juncture.\nOn loans that typically range between $5 to $15,000,\nhaving to go to court even once --\nQUESTION: Is that compensated for to some\nextent --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- that factor by the fact they're\nusing Blue Book value to value the car rather than what\nit'd actually be worth in your hands once you repossess\nit?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor. I think that\ncovers the depreciation problem. As we have delay and not\npayment, we have a rapidly depreciating asset, which the\ndebtor is continuing to possess and drive around. This\ninterest rate compensate for the risk of nonpayment of the\npromises to pay after confirmation and the costs\nassociated with the debtor's default if the debtor does\ndefault under the plan.\nQUESTION: I -- I don't think it's certainly\nconclusive of the point, but the initial 21 percent rate,\nI take it, did take into account the risk of default. So\nin a sense, the creditor has received up front some\ncompensation for the risk that in fact has occurred.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, but at the time the loan is\nmade, Your Honor, we don't know who in the pool of -- of\ndebtors is going to default. Once the default happens --\nQUESTION: Well, but -- but overall, you account\nfor that.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Overall the risks are spread, but\nif you force the secured party to systematically subsidize\ninterest rates to chapter 13 debtors, who have now\ndemonstrated by their filing they are the riskiest of the\nrisky, what you will eventually have happen is a\ncontraction of the ability to lend.\nQUESTION: But -- but your original -- you\ncharge 21 percent, and a lot of people are going to\nsuccessfully pay that and that stream there takes into\nconsideration some account for those who don't pay and go\ninto bankruptcy, doesn't it?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Your Honor, but we shouldn't\nreward those who file bankruptcy with a rate that is less,\nsince they are the riskiest of the risky, than we would\ncharge the other members of the pool who avoid bankruptcy.\nQUESTION: Maybe they're not.\nQUESTION: The -- the Bankruptcy Code, I take\nit, has solicitude for debtors. Isn't that one of its\npurposes?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, but --\nQUESTION: Or does that just drop out when we\ncome to the cramdown problem?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: As this Court indicated in the\nJohnson case, section 1325(a)(5)(B) is for the protection\nof creditors. It is a limit on the debtor's ability to\nadjust or restructure the creditor's rights. It is the\ncreditor's protection. The debtor has options. If the\ndebtor wants to surrender the collateral, it may and\ndischarge the debt. That is the protection for the\ndebtor.\nQUESTION: But what about then taking this idea?\nI'm trying to figure out how -- we say, okay, we really\nmean it. It has to equate those two things. Now, that\nput -- and -- and then stop and say, you can do it with --\nI -- I think, you know, prime plus or whatever, maybe the\nother. But -- but then put the burden back on you to\nproduce some real evidence and statistics about what\nhappens to people we don't know about.\nNow, who are those people? We agree they've\ngone into bankruptcy, so they're risky, but they're also\ntrying to get a second chance, and they also want to keep\nthings like the truck because it will help them in their\nbusiness. And the bankruptcy judge has sat there and\nlooked them in the eye. And you have all those things\nabout it which you don't have about the people you're\ngiving the 21 percent to which is a great mass of\nundifferentiated people.\nSo then you have the burden of trying to bear it\nout with statistics and so forth that these people really\nare risky. And the bankruptcy judge can't just sit there\nand say, oh, I feel sorry for them. All right? What\nabout something like that?\nMR. BRUNSTAD:\nthe chapter 13 confirmation stage, we're in a similar\nposition as when we are at the beginning of making loans\nto a pool of applicants. We don't know who's going to\ndefault and who doesn't. We do know that a large\npercentage will. We do know that the best evidence of a\nmarket rate for these particular class of borrowers is the\ncontract rate. And the question then becomes, do we want\nto have a system which requires us in each bankruptcy case\nthen to take evidence complicatedly in 471,000 chapter 13\ncases as to, gee, we need statistics and evidence as to\nthis individualized debtor?\nQUESTION: No, I mean, you wouldn't have to go\nthat far. Maybe you just have to do it in one or two.\nBut at least we'd get to the stage of people who have\ntrucks and use them for a year and, you know, at least\nwe'd have somewhat better information than just knowing\nabout the default rate in bankruptcy cases in general.\nAnd we get a little finer than that. You see, that's what\nI'm trying to work with. I don't have an answer.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: I understand.\nQUESTION: I'm asking.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: I understand, Your Honor, and I\nwish I could give you a precise formula. The problem is\nthat these things are normally left to the market to do.\nCongress has said -- Congress has said basically use an\neconomic market concept here in a context in which the\ndefault rate is so high that lenders are just not willing\nto lend to chapter 13 debtors. Again --\nQUESTION: But -- but I -- I thought the\ndifficulty of administration charge was the one that the\npetitioners were making against you. How -- how do I sort\nthat out?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: And I think -- I think it was\nYour Honor who also mentioned that -- that our standard is\nno less cumbersome than theirs. We think it is superior\nbecause it will yield the correct result more often.\nQUESTION: No more cumbersome. Surely, you mean\nit's no more cumbersome than theirs.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Your Honor. I -- I\nmisspoke. Excuse me.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. -- Mr. -- it is to this\nextent. Most of these debtors are very small debtors.\nYou say take the contract rate as the presumptive rate and\nthen we're going to knock down for all these other things.\nThe high replacement cost that -- is one thing. The\ninterest that they got before bankruptcy is another. The\ntransaction cost that they're saved, another. And so let\nthe debtor come in and show that. But the debtor has no\nmoney at all and certainly you don't want the debtor's\nmoney eaten up hiring an attorney and further depleting\nthe money that could go to the creditors.\nSo it seems to me wildly unrealistic to expect\nthat if you say the presumptive price is the contract\nprice, you're going to get a debtor who will be able to --\nI mean, I was surprised, looking at this record, that this\ndebtor got an expert. Who -- who paid the expert? Maybe\nbecause the union was involved?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: I do not know the answer to that,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: But isn't it typical that these\nchapter 13 debtors don't have lawyers and don't have\nexperts?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: No. They often have lawyers,\nYour Honor.\nBut let me suggest this. If the Court were to\nset the rate at the presumptive -- the contract rate as\nthe presumptive rate, this is what would happen and this\nis what has happened in circuits where that is so. The --\nthe contract rate becomes the presumptive rate, and in\nmost cases the debtor will offer that in its plan -- in\nhis or her plan as the appropriate rate. If the debtor\ndoesn't like that, we'll offer less of a rate and then\nwhat happens is a negotiation. And the debtor and the\nsecured party get together and they negotiate based upon\nthe debtor's presentation of this is why I think it should\nbe adjusted off of that because my circumstances have\nimproved or there's a lot of equity in this particular\ncollateral, so your risks are less, so you're more\nprotected. And those various reasons can then be given,\nand then the parties can negotiate.\nIf, however, you set a standard where the\nbankruptcy court is just simply going to decide based upon\nthe evidence that the parties put in, we're not going to\nadopt the formula approach, then you'll be back to the\nproblem where we are before, lots of litigation. Again,\nbecause the contract rate is the best evidence of a -- of\na market rate between these parties, it should be the\npresumptive rate and we should work from that.\nQUESTION: Is there any --\nQUESTION: May I ask you a question that's run\nthrough my mind listening to this argument? Going back to\nthe Rash case, was it, that we --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- we did not there -- the majority\ndid not there. I was in dissent in that case.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- did not take the case to try and\nreplicate what would have happened if there had been no\nbankruptcy. They said, we won't -- won't treat it as a --\nnow, you're in effect asking we do treat the case as close\nas possible to what you would have negotiated in a free\nmarket.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Not quite, Your Honor. I think\nactually this is the same analysis as in Rash. What the\nCourt said in Rash that the parties had to do was the\ndebtor had to go out -- the debtor already has the truck\n-- had the truck in Rash -- is go out and see what it\nwould have cost the debtor to replace that truck. It\ndidn't actually do it, but simply say what would it have\ncost.\nThe same principle applies here. The debtor\nshould actually go out and see what would someone pay.\nHow much would someone charge to finance this debtor's\nloan?\nQUESTION: Yes, but in doing that, they were\nsaying, we're going to do that instead of trying to\npredict what would happen to -- in the normal course of\nevents between the contracting parties if bankruptcy had\nnot intervened.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, that's true. In this case,\nthough, that also applies. What would happen if\nbankruptcy had not intervened is the secured party would\nhave foreclosed, repossessed the collateral, and avoided\nall the costs.\nQUESTION: But not at replacement value. You\nwould not have gotten replacement value.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: That's true, Your Honor, but the\nreason why you have replacement value is because the\ndebtor is going to keep the -- the collateral and prevents\nthe secured party from exercising its rights and forces\nthe secured party to incur costs that it otherwise would\navoid.\nNow, the whole purpose of the value requirement\nand the indubitable equivalent concept and the whole\ncramdown standard is to make sure the secured party\ndoesn't -- isn't shouldered with uncompensated risk.\nSo the question becomes what's best method of\ncompensating the secured party for its risk. And the\nstatute, because of what it requires, value as of the\neffective date of the plan using an economic concept, says\nwe basically have to value the stream of payments. Nobody\nreally is willing to say I would give this debtor $4,000\nor take this debtor's promise of payment of $4,000 at --\nat a prime rate or anything close to a prime rate. Again,\nthe contract date is the best evidence of a market\nvaluation that we have. And so that's what I think we\nhave to work with --\nQUESTION: Is there any --\nMR. BRUNSTAD: -- to be faithful to the statute.\nQUESTION: Is there any indication that if we\ntake that, that in fact it will increase the likelihood of\ndefault under the plan simply because the higher contract\nrate will tend to put more pressure on the -- the debtor\nthan the debtor in fact ultimately can -- can satisfy?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Your Honor, in the circuits\nwhere that already is the standard, that the -- that the\npresumptive rate is basically the rate that we use.\nQUESTION: Yes. What is their experience?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: There -- there is no information\nto say it's higher default rate. And certainly the fact\nthat most of the circuits have this standard has not\nstopped chapter 13 from being filed. They keep -- every\nyear the number goes up. So we're now at about 470,000\nchapter 13 cases a year.\nQUESTION: But it seems pretty obvious if it's a\nhigher rate, there are going to be more defaults.\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Well, not necessarily, Your\nHonor, for this reason. Because the debtor makes -- the\n-- the debtor does not make payments directly to creditors\nunder the chapter 13 plan. The debtor makes payments to\nthe chapter 13 trustee as a dispersing agent, and the\nchapter 13 trustee then distributes the money. What\nyou're doing here is you're reallocating in this case a\nfew hundred dollars away from unsecured creditors toward\nthe secured creditor because, again, the statute says the\nsecured creditor is not required to take -- shoulder\nuncompensated risk for the benefit of anybody else.\nThat's --\nQUESTION: Why not take the credit card rate?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Sorry, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: Why not take the credit card rate?\nWhy not take his mortgage rate? I mean, you see, those\naren't the right rates, are they?\nMR. BRUNSTAD: Here we have a situation in which\nthe correct rate for auto loans is evidenced by -- I think\nbest evidenced by the auto loan contract. It is a loan\nbetween this lender and this debtor, decided in the\nmarketplace, with this particular collateral. It is the\nbest evidence of a market rate that we have. It's not\nperfect, Your Honor. I concede that, but it is the best\nevidence.\nQUESTION: It's evidence at a different time\nbefore you had all the considerations. I mean, we're\ngoing in circles, and I mean, in some respects it's good,\nin some respects it's bad.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Brunstad.\nMs. Harper, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF REBECCA J. HARPER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. HARPER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nFirst of all, we need to get back to the concept\nof present value. Present value is the time value of\nmoney, which is the real rate of interest plus inflation.\nThe record in this case shows that the real rate of\ninterest was 2-and-one-half percent, and inflation was 3-\nand-one-half percent.\nNow, in this case, the debtors made all the\npayments. They actually paid the contract off early, but\nwe need to start with as pure a base as possible and then\nif there are special circumstances, sure, the bankruptcy\ncourt could have discretion to add on if there is\nparticular jeopardy to the property.\nBut we're measuring two different things here.\nThe -- the statute doesn't say contract. The statute\ndoesn't say market rate. This market rate concept has\nbeen misabused. And it -- right now under the bankruptcy\ncourt's interpretation anything is okay as long as you put\nthis market rate label on it, and that's not a proper\nstandard for chapter 13 confirmation.\nThe other problem is with the respondent's\napproach, the respondent uses words out of the Bankruptcy\nAct, pre-Bankruptcy Act, that simply were never enacted\nunder chapter 13. Full compensation, full value of their\nrights. That's nowhere in chapter 13.\nthe chapter 13 requirements. Indubitable equivalence.\nThat's not a chapter 13 confirmation concept. That's a --\nthat's a concept that was brought in to confuse this\nissue, but it is not chapter 13.\nRespondents -- their amicus said that under\ntheir interpretation of the statute, basically anything\ngoes. A rate from 100 percent to 300 percent would be\njust fine with them. Congress has not chosen to protect\nsubprime creditors. This goes against --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Harper.\n"
