        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in Case 07-320, Davis v. The Federal\nElection Commission.\nMr. Herman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW D. HERMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT\nMR. HERMAN: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case involves the constitutional\nquestion of whether the government may regulate the\npersonal spending of a candidate on behalf of his own\ncampaign. This is an activity that constitutes\npolitical expression at the core of the First Amendment,\nyet BCRA Section 319 seeks to deter and, failing that,\npenalizes such protected political expression. Even if\nthis Court finds that the harms upon speech of Section\n319 are modest, the provision still fails to satisfy any\nconstitutional standard. It furthers no legitimate\ngovernmental purpose and conversely increases the undue\ninfluence of contributions upon Federal candidates.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is no\nrestriction whatsoever on the wealthier candidate. He\ncan spend as much of his money as he wants.\nMR. HERMAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nThe harm from Section 319 is that he is burdened from\nthe beginning of his campaign throughout every step with\nthe knowledge that any time he spends money he is going\nto be providing his opponent with an advantage; he is\ngoing to be enhancing his opponent's speech.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if, for\nexample, somebody takes out a television ad that says\nsmoking this type of cigarette is actually, is not\nharmful to you. The government is free to take out a\ncontrary ad saying, no, it is and so you shouldn't do\nit, right?\nMR. HERMAN: Of course, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So governmental\nresponses to the exercise of free speech are not\nautomatically -- don't automatically burden the exercise\nof that speech.\nMR. HERMAN: That is absolutely correct,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, why does\nit burden it for the government to make it easier for\nprivate citizens to respond to that speech.\nMR. HERMAN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it's\nmaking it easier for a self-financed candidate's\nopponent to respond to that speech. In essence, what\nSection 319 says is, we are going to make it easier for\nyour opponent to beat you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Herman, can the\ngovernment respond to political speech? The government\ncan have a position on smoking cigarettes, it can have a\nposition on a lot of things, but can it have a position\non whether the Republican Party or the Democratic Party\nshould win the next election?\nMR. HERMAN: Absolutely not, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that a distinction\nhere?\nMR. HERMAN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What case supports\nthat proposition?\nMR. HERMAN: That the government cannot\ntake --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Government can't\nengage in political speech.\nMR. HERMAN: Your Honor, Buckley is on --\nthere is not anything --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How is the government\nspeaking? You have already acknowledged that the\nwealthy candidate can spend as much as he or she wants\nand the end result of this scheme is that there will be\nmore, not less, speech because the non-affluent opponent\nwill now have money to spend that he didn't have before.\nSo I think you have to concede that overall the scheme\nwill produce more political speech, not less.\nMR. HERMAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I can't\nconcede that, and this is the reason why. If Section\n319 operates as it's intended to, it will deter\nself-financed candidates from ever reaching that\n$350,000 threshold and triggering the, quote unquote,\n\"more speech.\" What it is really designed to do at\nevery single step --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Has it done it? I mean,\nwe do have some experience under the statute now.\nMR. HERMAN: We have very little experience\nunder the statute, Justice --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well your clients -- wasn't\nyour client's latest filing that he intended to spend a\nmillion dollars.\nMR. HERMAN: For the 2006 campaign?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I think that's --\nMR. HERMAN: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So it didn't deter him.\nYou're in the position in which it clearly didn't deter\nyour client. He says, I'm going to spend three times as\nmuch as the threshold figure, and there is no empirical\nevidence that it's deterring anybody else.\nMR. HERMAN: Well, Justice Souter, in fact\nit did deter my client. If you look at his election in\nits totality, his opponent spent over $5 million.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do we usually evaluate\nrestrictions on First Amendment rights on the basis of\nwhether the chill that was imposed by the government was\nactually effective in stifling the right?\nMR. HERMAN: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If the person goes ahead\nand speaks anyway, is he estopped from saying that the\ngovernment was chilling his speech nonetheless?\nMR. HERMAN: Absolutely not, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that's what's going\non here?\nMR. HERMAN: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Don't we expect a chill\nargument to at least have a ring of plausibility? And\nyour chill argument is that it is deterring. It didn't\ndeter your client. There is no indication that it would\ndeter anybody else and I have to say I don't see why it\nwould.\nMR. HERMAN: Justice Souter, respectfully, I\ndon't think that you can categorically say that it did\nnot deter my client when he was outspent by $3 million\nin that campaign. As he went through the campaign\nagainst his --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You mean if the -- if the\nother side had not had an enhanced spending capacity,\nyour client would then have spent $2 million?\nMR. HERMAN: Your Honor, he actually did\nspend $2 million.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Whatever it is, I mean are\nyou saying that if the -- if the client -- if the\nopposing party had not had an enhanced spending capacity\nyour client would have spent even more?\nMR. HERMAN: Potentially. Potentially.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That seems to substantiate\nthe, at least the ostensible basis for this statute.\nMR. HERMAN: Your Honor, if the basis for\nthe statute is to, quote unquote, \"level the playing\nfield,\" to equalize the candidates, I haven't received\nan explanation from the government or from the district\ncourt that explains how a statute designed to do that\nwould have allowed my client's opponent to have raised\nanother $1.4 million even though he had already outspent\nmy opponent by $3 million.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is there any reason to think\nthat this statute will have any greater or different\neffect of Mr. Davis in the upcoming election than it did\nin the last election?\nMR. HERMAN: There is, Justice Alito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why?\nMR. HERMAN: Because his incumbent opponent\nfrom the last two elections has announced his retirement\nand so Mr. Davis will now be facing very likely primary\nchallengers, and then if he were to prevail in the\nprimary he'll be meeting a non-incumbent challenger in\nthe general election as well. So it's an open seat.\nAnd again, one of the great deficiencies of\n319 is that it fails to take into account any of the\nadvantages of incumbency, not just the financial\nadvantages but the inherent advantage that each and\nevery incumbent brings to an election when he or she\nruns for re-election, the fact that the incumbent has\nmuch greater status as --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The government says that in\nfact more and quite a bit more incumbents went over the\n$350,000 personal funding limits than non-incumbents.\nSomething like -- I don't know, 14-2 or something like\nthat in the last election, is that right?\nMR. HERMAN: First of all, the statistics\nhere are incomplete because basically the briefing in\nthis case was concluded in early September of 2006,\nbefore a lot of primaries occurred for the 2006 House\nelection. And so I think referring to those numbers --\nthe FEC has never -- we've never received any additional\nnumbers for the effect, but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was a four-year\nrecord and the numbers are rather startling that -- is\nit 110 senators or representatives qualified for the\nenhanced contributions and only 6 of them were\nincumbents?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. HERMAN: The other number that was cited\nis that only 2 of 60 incumbents actually triggered the\nMillionaires' Amendment in those --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, that could mean\nthat the millionaires have already been elected and are\nnow pulling up the ladder after them.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HERMAN: That's certainly our argument,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if that's so, one\nof the reasons that has been given for this statute is\nthat it encourages the parties to favor the wealthier\ncandidates; it deters people who are non-affluent but\nhighly meritorious. So -- and it gives the public the\nperception that the seats in our Congress are there to\nbe bought by the wealthiest bidder. And if there's\nanything to that -- well, do you reject that out of hand\nas what the statute is all about?\nMR. HERMAN: Justice Ginsburg, I believe\nthat the -- the fact that the statute expands the\nsupposedly anti-corruptive $2300 to $6900 and allows a\nnational party to make coordinated communications of an\nunlimited amount in response to the, what Buckley called\n\"ameliorative speech\" by a self-financer, would also\nincrease the perception that -- that our candidates are\nthere to be bought. It seems to me that if Mr. Davis\nhad sat down and read all of this Court's jurisprudence\nbefore he decided to run, he wouldn't have seen a word\nin there about leveling the playing field.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought -- I\nthought your brief -- and correct me if I'm wrong --\nsaid at one stage that there is -- what Congress was\ndriving at is a valid concern, but there are less\nrestrictive alternatives. And I was trying to find what\nthose less restrictive alternatives were.\nMR. HERMAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I can\nthink of one off the top of my head which is not this\ncase, and that's public funding. If Congress were truly\nconcerned about providing a boost to minor party\ncandidates who may not be able to raise the $2300 to\nbegin with, much less take advantage of the benefits of\n319, or wanted to boost self-financed candidates who,\nsay, like Mr. DeRossett in the amicus brief, in his\namicus brief, who mortgaged his house or others who have\nencumbered their pensions and raised $350,000 or\n$400,000 and then triggered the amendment, if they\nwanted to foster all of those people of modest means to\nparticipate, then the easiest way and the way sanctioned\nby this Court in Buckley is to institute a public\nfunding system and allow them to choose. They can raise\nprivate funds if they'd like; they could do it\npersonally with their own money; or they could take\nwhatever amount that the -- that the State was willing\nto give them --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that wouldn't level the\nplaying field. I mean, the other side, the millionaire,\nwon't take the public funding and he'll spend his\nmillions and whoever gets the public funding -- or are\nyou saying the public funding should match whatever the\nother side pays?\nMR. HERMAN: No, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well then --\nMR. HERMAN: But this Court's analysis in\nBuckley -- the public funding analysis in Buckley does\nnot center on leveling the playing field or providing\nequality for all candidates. It --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that's a valid\nconstitutional objective, to level the playing field?\nMR. HERMAN: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think we should\ntrust our incumbent senators and representatives to\nlevel the playing field for us?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HERMAN: Absolutely not, Justice Scalia.\nAnd there's a reason why there's a distinction between\nan anti-corruptive purpose and a\nleveling-the-playing-field purpose. When Congress\nlegislates to deal with the actuality or appearance of\ncorruption, they are legislating uniformly and they're\nnot taking an interest in the outcome, in the\ncompetitiveness. When they are talking about leveling\nthe playing field, one of the players on that playing\nfield are incumbent members of Congress. It's like\nsaying that we're going to trust basketball players not\n-- to call their own out-of-bounds plays.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't there something\ndifferent between what the statute was at the time of\nBuckley, that a lid on, you can't spend more than X\namount of money, and a statute that says we're going to\nlet you spend, the sky is the limit for you, but we're\ngoing to give a boost to your opponent?\nMR. HERMAN: Justice Ginsburg, in Buckley\nthere -- there was no lid on personal expenditures. The\nCourt struck down that aspect of Buckley and upheld the\npublic funding provision. So the Court was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm talking about the\nstatute as it was originally enacted by Congress did\nhave expenditure limits and this Court said that was no\ngood. This statute doesn't have that problem because it\ndoesn't put a lid on the candidates self-financing.\nMR. HERMAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nBut -- but again, if you're going to make a comparison\nto the public funding system in Buckley that was\napproved by this Court, that system was indifferent to\nthe -- the source or the amount of funds. All the Court\nsaid there -- or the equality -- that that statute was\nindifferent to whether the playing field was level. All\n-- all Buckley said and all Congress said in enacting\nthe public funding was we want to take the allegedly\ncorruptive private funds out of the system, and we want\nto replace it with public funds and --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Even if -- even if leveling\nthe playing field is not generally a compelling or maybe\neven a permissible interest, is it a stronger interest\nwhen one of the reasons why the playing field is not\nlevel is other action that Congress has taken? If there\nweren't expenditure limits, then self-financed\ncandidates wouldn't perhaps have as much of an advantage\nas they do. So if we accept the world in which\ncontribution limits are constitutional, it -- does that\nprovide a basis for Congress to try to rectify at least\nin part what it itself has done by imposing the\ncontribution limits?\nMR. HERMAN: Justice Alito, leveling the\nplaying field is -- I'm not quite sure how Congress\nwould start to do that without implicating their own\ninterest. When you say that you're going to level the\nplaying field, Congress has to look at the whole playing\nfield. They can't just carve out a section that applies\nto other people and not talk about their interest in\nleveling the playing field. I think it's a very\ndifficult road to go down.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What we're talking about in\nleveling the playing field, I guess, is leveling the\namount of speech that each side has, to make sure that\neach side has the same amount of speech. Is that -- is\nthat what's going on here?\nMR. HERMAN: Well, it's an attempt to do\nthat. And again, in Buckley this Court said that --\nthat Congress has no interest in determining whether\nspeech is excessive or unwise or wasteful. That's --\nthat's ultimately the purview for the voters, and that's\nreally the fallacy in 319 at its heart, is there's no\nsuch thing as secret self-funders. They will --\neverything that they do is disclosed in the same way\nthat all other expenditures and contributions are\ndisclosed in quarterly and pre-election reports.\nCertainly, in many cases, their opponents are going to\nmake the case that this wealthy person is out of touch,\nthey don't represent the district, your vote is not to\nbe bought. And then ultimately the voters will have the\ndetermination on what kind of candidate they want.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are we -- are we talking\nwealthy people here? What's the average price of a home\nin the United States? I think it's a good deal above\n$350,000, isn't it?\nMR. HERMAN: It certainly is in this area\nand in many congressional districts in the United\nStates. And that's a very good point, Justice Scalia.\nThis provision affects less -- about a quarter of what\nit costs to run a competitive race in 2006. So\ncertainly it's not as if Congress said, well, if you\nspend some disproportionate amount of money to a\ncongressional race, if you go ten times over what it\nshould cost, we're going to step in. They said --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't think that\nwould be any more constitutional than this, do you?\nMR. HERMAN: I think it would be equally\nunconstitutional, Mr. Chief Justice. But if you're\ntalking about the tailoring of the statute, I think that\nthat is certainly something that's relevant.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'd like to ask about the\nprovisions of the statute which allow the candidate who\ndoesn't have the personal funds -- what was the name of\nthe challenger in this case? Not Davis -- Reynolds?\nMR. HERMAN: Tom Reynolds.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Reynolds -- - to receive,\nis it, unlimited contributions from his own party?\nMR. HERMAN: He can receive up to 100\npercent of whatever that OPFA number is -- the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. HERMAN: -- the purported difference in\nfunds.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you had a statute\nwhich either explicitly said or has the effect, as this\ndoes, that the less wealthy challenger, the challenger\nin Reynolds' position, has more access and more support\nfrom his party than the challenger does from his party?\nWhat is your best case that indicates that that is\nunconstitutional, and what is your argument that that is\nunconstitutional?\nMR. HERMAN: I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That concerns me in this.\nWhat is your best argument that differential treatment\nof the candidates vis-a-vis support from their\nrespective parties is unconstitutional?\nMR. HERMAN: Well, again, Your Honor, if\nyou're making a distinction -- when you talk about the\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The statute makes that\ndistinction.\nMR. HERMAN: Well, the statute talks about\nthe less wealthy candidate.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me that\nthat distinction is somewhat questionable, and I'm\nasking you for your best statement of the theory as to\nwhy it's unconstitutional and your best case to show\nthat it's unconstitutional.\nMR. HERMAN: The best argument, Justice\nKennedy, is that money and speech are synonymous in an\nelectoral context, and it's inappropriate for the\ngovernment to say that you, as the purportedly wealthier\ncandidate, have too much speech; that that's enough\nspeech from you.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you make that argument\nto the statute generally. Is there any more specific\nargument that you can make in the context of the less\nwell-funded candidate having more support from the party\nthan the well-funded candidate had?\nMR. HERMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that that's\na particular vice of the statute, and I want to know if\nthere is a formulation that's more precise than the\ngeneral attack that you made -- that you make.\nMR. HERMAN: I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you clarify with\nrespect to that question two things: The party is not\nat liberty to give anything it wants. You explained\nthat it would be -- it's tied to that formula. So the\nwealthy person could still have a lot more to spend.\nBut the party also is -- there's no obligation of the\nparty to give one cent to anybody that it doesn't choose\nto give money to; is that right?\nMR. HERMAN: No, Justice Ginsburg. Of\ncourse, the party would have to make a determination if\nthey felt that this person was --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the party for the less\nwell-funded candidate has the option to have much closer\nties, much greater involvement, than the party for the\nother candidate; and that seems to me highly\nproblematic. And I want to know the best case that you\nhave for that proposition and the best statement of law\nthat can you give me for why that is unconstitutional.\nMR. HERMAN: Well, Justice Kennedy, if you\nrefer to Colorado II, where this Court talked about the\nfacts that -- where this Court upheld limitations on\nparty, unlimited party- coordinated communications,\nbecause that -- allowing the party to do so would raise\nthe possibility of evading the contribution limits. And\nso accordingly they upheld the 42 -- the $42,000 limit\non coordinated communication.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you said\nearlier that money is -- money is speech in this area.\nSo I take it you think that the restrictions, otherwise\napplicable restrictions on the less wealthy candidate,\nraise problems under the First Amendment?\nMR. HERMAN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this law eases\nthose problematic restrictions. It's less violative of\nthe First Amendment.\nMR. HERMAN: It is less violative of the\nFirst Amendment, but, again, this Court has made the\ndistinction between contribution limits, which it found\nwas a reasonable burden on the Constitution, and\nexpenditure limits, which -- which are not. This --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't limit those\nrestrictions on your candidate.\nMR. HERMAN: It does not limit the\nrestrictions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It simply makes the\nimposition of the restrictions uneven.\nMR. HERMAN: That is, that is correct. But\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but your\ncandidate isn't subject to any restriction at all on\nwhat he can spend and his opponent is subject to less\nrestrictions. It seems to me the First Amendment comes\nout better.\nMR. HERMAN: He is -- my candidate, my\nclient, is subject to restrictions. The statute in its\nentirety --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why can't he go out and\nraise funds? Does the statute prohibit him from raising\nfunds from third parties?\nMR. HERMAN: Absolutely not, Justice\nStevens. But for many -- for many self-financed\ncandidates, the fact that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't it prohibit -- I\nthought it prohibited him from raising funds in the\namount from as wealthy donors as his opponent can now go\nto? Don't those limits on contributions continue to\napply to him?\nMR. HERMAN: The contribution limits apply\nto him as they would to any other candidate except for\nhis opponent.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And he cannot have the\nsupport from his party that the opponent can have from\nthe opponent's party.\nMR. HERMAN: He cannot have the same level\nof support.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Not the same level of\nsupport.\nMR. HERMAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And is party support\nsometimes important in an election?\nMR. HERMAN: Of course, it can be vital in\nan election, and it can be vital for a candidate who may\nbe a candidate of modest means. That would be certainly\none way for them to generate support. Did he convince\ntheir party that they were worthy of that support?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does anything in Colorado\nindicate that there can be a differential between the\nparty support given to one candidate and the party\nsupport given to the other?\nMR. HERMAN: Not -- only as determined by\nthe party's decision as to how they feel about the\ncandidate's positions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but they certainly\ncan allocate funds more generously to one candidate than\nanother; can't they?\nMR. HERMAN: They certainly have that\nopportunity, but under -- under a limit, under the\n$42,000 limit, as opposed to essentially an infinite\nlimit when you're dealing with a self- funded candidate.\nAnd incidentally, Justice Stevens, to\naddress something else that you just brought up, for\nmany self-financed candidates the fact that they don't\ntake money from their party or from donors or from PACs\nis a significant issue for them in their campaign. I\nmean certainly for Mr. Davis, the fact that he is\nindependent and can make his own determinations --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who is more incorruptible\nthan the millionaire, right?\nMR. HERMAN: He is the ultimate independent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The ultimate incorruptible.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HERMAN: You cannot corrupt yourself.\nAnd, again, the voters will get to decide whether they\nwant someone who is like that or they want someone who\nis more in tune with, say, what the party wants or with\nwhat his donors want. I mean, that's really the essence\nof our -- of our electoral system.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think -- I mean,\nobviously you're correct that this system benefits\nincumbents, but it benefits your client in a particular\nway as well. The parties are certainly interested in\ncandidates who will fund themselves because that\npresents less strain on the party's resources.\nMR. HERMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, they are\ninterested in those candidates only inasmuch as they get\nelected. The moment that the public turns on them, they\nwon't be interested. And certainly the public was not\nparticularly interested in Mitt Romney, who spent a\nsignificant amount of money on his own behalf, and many\nother spectacular flameouts.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure we need\ncharacterizations of the political candidates --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HERMAN: I apologize.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in this forum.\nMR. HERMAN: Let me just add -- let me just\nadd one other thing. The government's own experts, all\nof their information is derived from an individual who\nis quoted as saying that self- financed candidates\nrarely win, and when they do, it's usually for some\nother reason. The fact of the matter is they don't\nalways make great candidates because they're not within\nthe mainstream.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Herman.\nGeneral Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nAppellant's claim here is an odd sort of\nFirst Amendment complaint. He does not suggest that\nSection 319 has limited his own spending at all. In\nfact, he has twice spent a substantial amount of his own\nmoney in excess of the statutory triggers.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It has penalized his own\nspending.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well -- and we can talk\nabout that as well, but I think it's worth recognizing\nthat his own spending is unlimited both in theory and in\nfact. And, if anything, he has announced his intent\nthis next time around to spend even more of his own\nmoney. And the other thing that I think is relevant is\nhis experience is not atypical in this regard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That just means he is\nwilling to accept the penalty in the next election even\nif this case doesn't come out in his favor.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't prove that it\nisn't a penalty.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't think in any\nway it's a penalty. And I think in order to understand\nit as a penalty you have to accept the proposition that\nyou start out with a constitutional entitlement to speak\nfreely without the opportunity for the other side to\nrespond, and I don't think the Constitution recognizes\nthis.\nThis isn't a context where they forced the\nAppellant to pay for the other side's speech, as in\nTornillo, or carry the speech, as in PG&E. And I don't\nthink it's fair to look at the record here and suggest\nthat what Congress was trying to do here was actually\nlimit or deter self-financing.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, isn't there something\nvery -- isn't there something very strange about having\ndifferent contribution limits for candidates in an\nelection? Do you think it would be constitutional for\nCongress to say that the -- the contribution limits for\nincumbents is X, but for challengers it's 2X or one-half\nX?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think 2X would be\nconstitutional. And I think most people would be\nsurprised if Congress passed the statute that gave more\ngenerous contribution limits to challengers, but I think\nit would be a perfectly appropriate regime because it\nwould recognize that incumbents have certainly built-in\nadvantages such that the relatively low hard money\ncontribution caps have a greater influence, greater\nimpact on a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think that's really a\nproper function of government, to look out over there\nand say, we're going to even the playing field in this\nelection? What if some -- one candidate is more\neloquent than the other one? You make him talk with\npebbles in his mouth or what?\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, I think\nthere's an important distinction that was suggested in\none of Justice Alito's question, between the government\ntrying to level the playing field in the abstract and\nthe government looking out, not at the eloquence of\ncandidates, but at its own campaign finance regime after\nthis Court's decision and recognizing that, look, the\ndifferential --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the campaign finance\nregimes we've approved up to now, the significant\nlimitations, have had an anti-corruption rationale.\nThere is no anti-corruption rationale here. The only\npurpose of this is to level the playing field. And I am\ndeeply suspicious of allowing elections to be conducted\nunder a regime whereby Congress levels the playing\nfield. That seems to be very dangerous.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, again, Justice\nScalia, though, you start with the anti-corruption\nrationale that underlies the hard money contribution\ncaps. And what Congress has recognized is that after\nBuckley and after this Court said that a candidate's\nability to self-finance is unlimited, it's recognized\nthat in a subset of elections where somebody is going to\nspend an awful lot of their own money to self-finance,\nthe ordinary hard money contribution caps are going to\nhave a potentially skewing effect.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not just money. It's\nnot just money. It's the quality and kind of speech.\nYou're saying, the government is saying, the statute\nsays, that the underfunded candidate has less access to\ncoordinated expenditures with the party than -- than the\nother party -- than the other candidate. And the cases\nhave acknowledge, the statute acknowledges, that\ncoordinated expenditures have a particularly potent\nforce, and you are saying candidates are treated\ndifferently in the access to this kind of speech.\nAnd I know of no precedent of this Court\nthat says one party is entitled to assistance from a\ncertain segment and another party is not, based on\nthe -- the content of the speech. And that's exactly\nwhat this is.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy,\nwhat I would say is, if you analogize to a system where\nCongress decided that because of the advantage that\nincumbents have, there is a greater scope for\ncoordination of the party with the challengers, I would\ncertainly be here defending that statute.\nI would like to make clear, though, Justice\nKennedy, in fairness, that this focus on the coordinated\nexpenditures of the parties has really not been the\nfocus of Appellant's challenge in this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it's in the statute\nand it's part of the challenge. I agree that it's been\ngiven a relatively minor position, but it's of great\nconcern to me because it puts this Court, it puts this\nstatute, in the position of preferring one kind of\nspeech over another. And we simply do not do that.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy, let\nme say two things about the fact that this was not the\ngravamen of the challenge here, because one reason I\nthink that's clear is if you look at the record here, at\nthe point that the record closed in this case no party\nhad taken advantage of that coordinated expenditures\nprovision.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying that\nargument is not properly before us when we are judging\nthe validity of the statute that's been challenged?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I'm saying that this\nrecord would not allow you to invalidate the statute on\nthat ground. The record at the time that it closed\nshould -- there was no time that a party had taken\nadvantage of that. Now, I understand that it's outside\nthe record, but I understand after the record closed\nthere were some coordinated expenditures.\nBut another thing I would certainly want to\nknow before I considered that challenge, Justice\nKennedy, is whether this particular Appellant had\ncoordinated expenditures from his own party up to the\nlimit, because we know as a general matter that there\nis -- parties will fund different candidates differently\nor may fund --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the provisions --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- some and not others.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The provisions of the law\nwhich prefers one candidate over the other with respect\nto coordinated expenditures has an impact on campaign\nstrategy.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, again, Justice\nKennedy, in fairness, though, I mean, one would expect\nif that were the nature of the claim, that at a minimum\nwe would know two facts that I don't know, aren't in the\nrecord. One is whether or not his candidate reached the\ncap from his party's coordinated expenditures, because\nif he didn't I don't see why that individual would have\nstanding.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Solicitor General,\nyou're defending this statute on its face, I take it.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I am defending --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me that\nthis is a facial invalidity of substantial proportions.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy, I\nalways thought it was harder to bring a facial\nchallenge, not easier to bring a facial challenge. And\nI realized that we relaxed the normal rules about\nas-applied challenges in the First Amendment context,\nbut I think there has to be a limit to that, too. And I\nthink in a case where we don't know the fundamental\nfacts that at least I'd want to know before even\nevaluating that challenge, I think it would be bad for\nus to invalidate the statute, it would be wrong for us\nto invalidate the statute on those grounds. And I think\nI would still be here defending it. --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that that's what\na facial challenge essentially consists of. You don't\nlook to see whether in fact the harmful First Amendment\neffect has occurred; you look to whether it opens up the\npossibility for that to occur.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But I don't think mere\ntheoretical possibility is enough, even in the First\nAmendment context. And I still think you ask the\nquestion: Does this individual even have standing to\nbring the First Amendment challenge? And I would think\nan element of standing to bring the First Amendment\nchallenge Justice Kennedy has in mind would be a\ncandidate who, first of all, his opposing candidate took\nsubstantial amounts of excess contributions. But at a\nbare minimum, I would think that the plaintiff would\nhave to say that, look, I took up to the cap of the\ncoordinated contributions from my party and I would have\nloved to have gotten more, the party was willing to give\nme more, but I wasn't able --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can't go in before the\nelection and say: Look, I'm about to be terribly\ndisadvantaged; my opponent is about to have all of these\ncoordinated expenses and I'm not able to. And you're\ngoing to say: Oh, we have to wait until the election is\nover to see whether in fact that happens. It seems to\nme this is precisely the kind of a situation a facial\nchallenge is designed for.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice\nScalia, there is two things. There is whether you can\nbring a facial challenge or not and there's when you can\nyou bring it. And I think if you go in and allege that\nall of those things are likely, then you probably have\nstanding at the outset.\nBut those allegations weren't made here.\nThe focus of this case has always been on the\ncontribution levels and the contribution provisions of\nthis statute. At the end of the day the analysis is\nquite similar, so I'm not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't one of the virtues\nof the independent self-financed candidate is he can\nemphasize his independence? So he very rarely is going\nto complain about not being able to get too much money,\nenough money from outside sources. And isn't it a fact\nthat most of them do finance a very significant\npercentage of their total campaign costs?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think all that's right,\nJustice Stevens. And as you suggest, it's an unlikely\nchallenge to be brought because often times the\nself-financer is advertising his independence from party\nand contributors here.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you want us to write an\nopinion which says that independently wealthy candidates\ngenerally have different sorts of views than other\npeople?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, I don't think that's\ntrue. But I think that they do have different ways of\nraising the funds necessary to mount their campaigns.\nAnd I think -- to get back to the focus of\nthis, I think all that the Court needs to recognize is\nthat the Buckley decision itself has created a potential\nanomaly, because if you want to think about\nself-financing, you can think about it as being the\nultimate form of soft money, because the Constitution\nitself precludes Congress from limiting the amount of\nself-funding.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General, we haven't\ntalked yet about the disclosure, the special disclosure\nrequirements in that money is speech, and in a First\nAmendment area it strikes me as very problematic that\nthe government requires you to disclose in a\ndifferential way how you intend -- when you're spending\na particular amount of money and on such precise\nday-by-day requirements.\nI mean, is there any other area -- if you're\nwriting a book, you don't have to disclose to the\ngovernment when you're going to publish it and how far\nalong you're getting in the draft. And yet, it just\nseems this is the same sort of thing in the election\ncontext.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice,\nthere are other contexts within the election area where\nthere are comparable disclosure requirements. And I\nthink I would point you to the McConnell case and the\nfact that this Court approved a 24-hour disclosure\nrequirement for electioneering communications.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But those are\napplicable across the board. These are special\ndisclosure requirements for people who are going to\nengage in additional speech.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I mean, I'm not --\nI'm not sure that's right in a sense that these are\ndisclosure requirements that apply across the board.\nThe timing is triggered particularly by a candidate's\ncontribution to their own campaign. So that's the way\nin which they're different. But I think it's worth\nfocusing on that, because I actually think the\nconstitutional issues that are implicated by a\ndisclosure of a candidate's contribution to his or her\nown campaign are actually less significant than\ngenerally is true of campaign finance disclosure,\nbecause what this Court talked about in Buckley as the\nprimary concern in the disclosure context was the\nassociational rights that are reflected when somebody\ncontributes to a candidate or an organization makes an\nelectioneering communication on behalf of a candidate.\nI think those associational interests are\nobviously not implicated when all you're forcing someone\nto disclose is the amount that they spent on their own\ncampaign.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So wouldn't you\nthink they would require more detailed and more\nexpeditious disclosure of the associational link than of\nthe self-funding? And yet it's the exact opposite?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No. I would think the\nConstitution would be more concerned about the\ndisclosing the associational link because there is more\nthan one constitutional interest at issue. And I think\nif you look at this as a whole there really isn't a\ndifferential regime. Every electioneering communication\nfrom the first $10,000 has to be disclosed. If\nanything, the complaint should be the electioneering\ncommunication should come in here complaining about the\nfact that these self-financing candidates get a free\npass for the first $350,000 of their financing, before\nthe disclosure requirements kick in.\nSo I mean, I really think this is a\nrelatively modest disclosure provision and it arises in\na context where there aren't associational interests.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The problem is it's every\n$10,000. As you pointed out, it doesn't require more\ndisclosure. All of this information would be disclosed\nunder the system without this 24-hour, and that I think\nis the complaint, the burden of having every time you\nspend $10,000 to file something.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But Justice Ginsburg, I\nthink that's the same in the electioneering\ncommunications, which is it's triggered for $10,000 but\nI think it continues to be triggered. Now, it isn't the\nnature of the challenge, so I may be wrong about that,\nbut I think that's the way that that works.\nIn any event, I think it's a fair point here\nthat the fact that you trigger additional disclosures\nwith each $10,000 I think is useful in informing the\nelectorate; but I also think it's fair to say is\nnecessary in order for the substantive provisions of the\nstatute to operate, because what they want to do is they\nwant to enable as a self-financed candidate spends\nadditional money as the election date approaches, they\nwant to put the opponent, if they have otherwise reached\nthe cap of what they can raise in additional funds in a\nposition to continue to raise additional funds.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the -- what\nif the restriction were more tailored, if Congress\ndecided the one area where the wealthy really have an\nadvantage is buying television time, so that's what\nwe're going to restrict. If the wealthy individual buys\na certain amount of television time, we're going to\nallow contributions to the less wealthy candidate to buy\ntelevision time. They think the money is not as big a\ndeal in the other areas. Would that be all right?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think it would be\nconstitutional, Mr. Chief Justice. I think it's\nreacting to the same basic phenomenon, which is one\naspect of the campaign finance regime gives self-\nfinancers an ability to spend a tremendous amount of\nmoney and creates a potential disparity. What creates\nthe disparity is the fact that you have relatively low\nhard money contribution caps, and Congress recognized --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if one party has more\ntime on his hands? He's -- he's unemployed, so he --\nyou know, he can go around, whereas the other party has\nto -- has to hire people to speak for him. He has -- he\nhas a job most of the time. Are you going to even that\ndisparity, too?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, Justice Scalia, and\nagain I think there's an important distinction between\ntrying to level the playing field in every respect --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I can understand leveling,\nleveling contribution limits when you're worried about\ncorruption, I can understand that. But doing it just to\n-- to make sure that there is an even playing field, I\n-- there's just no end to that. And it just isn't money\nthat makes it an even playing feed. A lot of other\nfactors -- incumbency, the war chest that incumbents\nhave which -- money from the last election, that isn't\ncounted for -- for the millionaires' provision.\nThere are so many factors that -- that go to\nmaking the even playing field that I -- I'm just very\nreluctant to acknowledge a congressional power to -- to\nsit in judgment of our elections that way.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I\nmean, in an odd way I think this principle is actually\nimplicit in the plurality opinion against -- in Randall\nv. Sorrell. I know you didn't join that opinion, but in\nthat opinion this Court said, the plurality said, that\ncontribution limits can in some ways be too low because\nif they're too low they preclude the ability for\nsomebody to raise enough money and that exaggerates the\nadvantages that incumbents have. And I think Congress\nreally made an analogous judgment here. I'm not\nsuggesting it was constitutionally compelled, but they\nmade an analogous judgment, which is there is more than\none source of advantage; one source of advantage is the\nself-financing candidate's ability to spend unlimited\namounts of their own money. They respected the fact\nthat that's a constitutional entitlement, but they said\nit's not that in the abstract that's the problem; it's\nthe combination of unlimited self-financing and\nrelatively low hard money contribution caps --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- and they relaxed the\none thing that they could control, which was the cap.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what if Congress\ndecided that a debate on a particular issue was\ndistorted by the wealth of owners of newspapers? And so\nit passed a law saying that people who are responding to\nthat are relieved of the tax burden they would otherwise\nhave to pay, on whatever their -- you know, sales tax on\npamphlets that they want to sell. Would that be all\nright?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To level the playing\nfield on the debate on that particular issue?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think it might be and\nit's not that radically different than what this Court\napproved in Ragan against Taxation Without\nRepresentation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No -- so you can tax\n-- you can tax a newspaper, but you cannot -- you don't\nhave to tax people who are responding to the newspaper?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The taxing power is\nan -- is a limit on the exercise of First Amendment\nrights?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Maybe there are\ndifferences in that particular context. Maybe the\nFreedom of Press clause informs the analysis. But this\nCourt has upheld the regime that withheld tax benefits\nto an organization if it engaged in lobbying; and at the\nsame time this Court said that it was okay to give those\ntax benefits --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's any --\nany organization that engaged in lobbying.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Yes, but the next couple\nof lines of the opinion said: And it's okay if we give\nthose tax benefits back to a veterans organization, but\nonly veterans organizations. So I just think what that\ncase shows up is that the Court has recognized that the\ngovernment has a fair amount of flexibility.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is there no\nlimitation on the rationale of leveling the playing\nfield throughout the First Amendment?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, there is -- there is a\nlimiting principle, and I think that, importantly, there\nis a limiting principle that's very applicable to this\nvery context, which is I think if Congress went to the\npoint where they weren't doing what I think they're\ndoing here, which is not trying to limit the amount of\nself-financing, but using it as a mechanism here to\nidentify particularly costly races where they should\nraise the contribution limits, if they went further and\nbasically said we're going to give you public financing\nif your opponent self-finances, and we're going to give\nyou two dollars for every dollar that your opponent\nself-finances, I think at that point as a practical\nmatter the regime would operate as a ban on -- as a cap,\njust like this Court held in Buckley.\nBut I think that's the way to approach this\nissue, which is to basically say if what Congress is\ndoing is really trying to effectively cap\nself-expenditures, then Congress cannot do that; but if\nwhat Congress is doing is giving candidates choice and\nis trying to react to the regulatory environment created\nby self-financing --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's trying --\nit's certainly trying to chill self-financing by\nburdening it when it reaches a certain level.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I mean, I really don't\nthink that's an accurate description of what happened\nhere, because if you look at the legislative record here\n-- I know not everybody likes to do that -- but if you\nlook at the legislative record here, you will see that\nboth parties in this, the opponents and the proponents\nof this amendment, realize that they couldn't limit\nself-financing and that they were unlikely to limit\nself-financing because it's such an attractive option\nfor parties and for candidates. And both parties took\nit as a given that the effect of Section 319 and its\nSenate counterpart would be to put more money, not less\nmoney, into electoral speech.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How is it that there is a\nserious corruption problem in most instances if a\ncontributor gives more than $2,300 to a candidate, but\nthere is no serious -- presumably Congress doesn't think\nthere is a serious corruption problem when this statute\nkicks in and somebody gives $6,900 to a candidate?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Alito, what\nI would say is that what the relaxation of the\ncontribution limits reflects is an adjustment of other\ninterests; and I don't think in principle what Congress\nhas done here is different from what a number of States\ndo, which is they say for the race for governor the\ncontribution cap limit is going to be 2,000; for State\nauditor it will be a little less; and for local\nrepresentative it will be substantially less.\nNow, I suppose somebody could have come in\nand said, look, you know, the race for governor you can\ngive $2,000; you can only give a 1,000 for this\nrepresentative race, so surely that's irrational because\nthe State has recognized that a contribution of $2,000\nis noncorrupting. It's not the way it's ever proceeded\nand I think this Court's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't there a difference,\nbecause it may take -- it may take more money to\ncampaign for a particular office, and so the -- it might\ntake a greater amount to have a corrupting influence on\n-- on that particular race than on a race where the\ntotal amount spent is -- is lower. But here you're not\ntalking about different offices.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No. But I think you're\ntalking about Congress using a mechanism that is equally\neffective in identifying races that are likely to be\nmore expensive. When one party is spending more than\n$350,000 of their own money, that's every bit as likely\nto be a more expensive race than the race for governor\nor State treasurer or a local representative. And\nthat's why I think this is so responsive to the problem\nthat Congress recognized with the combination --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But it applies different\nlimits to different in the same -- to candidates in the\nsame race. So why would Mr. Davis be subject to\npotential corruption if he got $2,300 -- $2,301 from a\n-- from a contributor, but his opponent in exactly the\nsame race would not be exposed to corruption if he got\n$6,900?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, can I say two things\nin response to that? One is it would not be\nunprecedented for this Court to approve a regime where\nthe choices of the candidates led to different\ncontribution levels in the exact same race for the exact\nsame office, because that's what happens in Buckley in\nthe public financing scheme that this Court approved.\nIf somebody accepts public financing for the general\nelection for presidency, they are effectively agree to a\nzero contribution limit; whereas, their opponent, minor\nparty opponent for example, would be subject to higher\ncontribution level.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the price of\naccepting the government subsidy. They're -- nobody is\naccepting a government subsidy here. The man is\nspending his own money --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But one --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- for a speech.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But one of the prices of\naccepting the government subsidy in Buckley was to agree\nto limit your own financing of your own campaign to\n$50,000.\nNow, their whole theory of this case is that\nsomehow a benefit to their opponent is the same thing as\na detriment to themselves. And it seems to me that -- I\nmean, the base lines here are sufficiently manipulable;\nthe analogy is exactly the same.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you back to Justice\nKennedy's question, where as I took it he identifies a\nproblem that he sees in this portion of this act which,\nshould the limit be exceeded by our opponent, then we\ncan go to the party and the party can give us more?\nNow, assume for the sake of argument that he has\ncorrectly identified a problem with that. Now, my\nunderstanding is that once the limit is exceeded and you\nhave this extra amount, three things happen: One, an\nindividual could contribute two or three times the\namount to the party directly. A second possibility is\nan individual who has exceeded the global amount now\ngets a bump up and can contribute. And the third thing\nis the party thing.\nSo focus on that statute where this is\nwritten. In your opinion, if, for the sake of argument,\nthere were a problem with the party, would that\nparticular form of words in the statute be severable\nfrom the rest of it?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It certainly would,\nJustice Breyer, and one thing to keep in mind in\ninterpreting the statute is that it has Section 401 of\nthe original BCRA -- I think we have it at page 28 of\nour brief -- is what I would describe, I think, as a\n\"super-severability\" clause, because it says not only\nare unconstitutional provisions severable, but even\nunconstitutional applications of the same provision are\nseverable.\nAnd I think there would be no problem\neffectively leaving the statute with the disclosure\nrequirements in place and two of the three means of\ntaking advantage of additional opportunities that the\nstatute affords challengers.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: So I certainly think it\nwould be severable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: On the theory that it\ndoesn't make much sense anyway? Is that why --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- we can chop it up this\nway?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No. To the contrary, on\nthe theory that this statute operates on this record\nwithout that provision being implicated at all. I mean,\nin the first applications of this, the entirety of the\n2004 election cycle, no party took advantage of the\ncoordinated --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- contributions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that Justice Breyer's\nquestion, General Clement, was he asked you to assume\nthat that was unconstitutional, and you were answering\nif it was unconstitutional. But there is one person\nwhose speech is being discouraged in the picture, and\nthat's the contributor to the self-financed candidate.\nYou have to recognize that that one can't speak as much\nvis-a-vis the contributors to the other candidate.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I mean, I would concede\nthat there will be these differential limits, but it's\nbased on the choice of the candidate to engage or not in\nself-financing, and -- I mean, the restriction there is\nmuch more substantial than the public financing scheme\napproved by this Court in Buckley, because in the\ngeneral election if the candidate decides that it's\ngoing to -- that a candidate is going to take the public\nfinancing scheme then in the general presidential\nelection I can't give even a dollar to that candidate.\nAnd it's also I think worth recognizing that\nin Buckley this Court recognized that, for\nconstitutional and associational rights purposes, it's\nreally the ability to associate with the candidate by\ngiving any contribution, rather than the amount of the\ncontribution, that satisfies that limit.\nIn all events, this is not a challenge\nthat's being brought by contributors. And I think it's\nworth recognizing that Appellant, even though some of\nits challenge, and I would say the gravamen of the\nchallenge, sounds -- his challenge sounds in equal\nprotection terms, he doesn't really want a leveling-up\nwhere the opportunity would be for contributors to both\ncandidates to make triple the $2300 limits. He really\nwants to keep the yoke of relatively low contribution\nlimits on his opponents. And that's why I think this is\nsuch an odd First Amendment challenge.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the law\nexpressed a displeasure at the introduction of\nself-financing and said that, as you have these very\nrapid disclosures, that the less wealthy candidate can\naccept contributions whatever, twice the amount of\nwhatever the self-financed candidate is spending on his\ncampaign? Is that all right?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I mean, I'm not sure I\nhave the hypo. If he can spend twice as much?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he -- you\nknow, the millionaire, as we are talking about, spends\n-- discloses that he has spent $500,000. Then the\ncontribution limits are off the table for the less\nwealthy candidate to the tune of a million dollars, in\nother words twice as much as the self-financed\ncandidate.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: If I'm understanding the\nhypo which we were just talking about contribution\nlimits, because there are no expenditure limits, if I'm\nunderstanding the hypo right, I think that would still\nbe okay. I mean, I think if Congress had decided here\nthat if a self-financer spends beyond a certain amount,\nthen what is important is that then the contribution\nlimits would be lifted entirely. I suppose Congress\ncould do that, as long as they maintained what they\ncalled the \"parity principle\" or the \"proportionality\nprinciple,\" which is in no circumstance will the\nopponent be able to raise more than the amount of the\nadditional spending. And if your hypo is suggesting\nthat that would be relaxed so that they could raise\ntwice as much, I think that would raise more difficult\nconstitutional questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why not?\nBecause as -- your point in this case, rather than the\nhypothetical, is that the self-financed candidate is not\nburdened in any way, but simply that his opponent has\nbenefited. And it seems to me that would be true in the\ncase of my hypothetical as well.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Again, if I'm\nunderstanding the hypo right, I think you would say\nthere that the candidate is effectively burdened because\nif you get to the point where you're past what I would\ncall \"parity\" and you actually -- by spending an\nadditional dollar, you're allowing your opponent to\nspend $2 additional additionally, I think at that point\na rational candidate is not going to engage in\nself-finance. And so in practice, the provision would\noperate as an absolute cap, rather than the way it\noperates here, which is not as a cap. And I think if\nyou look at the numbers in the record, joint appendix\npage 89 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought\nall the arguments that you gave before, like the\nself-financed candidate wants to be able to say he\ndoesn't rely on contributions and so on, those would\nstill be equally applicable.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: They would, but I do think\nthe statute in practice would operate quite differently.\nAnd that's why I think it's very helpful that we have a\nrecord here in this case that we can cite to.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's not a --\nit's not a qualitative argument you're making but a\nquantitative. At some point, the benefit to the\nopponent gets to be too much of a chill on the\nself-financed candidate, but under this system you think\nit's below the line.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I would put it differently\nand say we're not arguing for a principle without\nlimits, but what I would say is that we really benefit\nhere from the fact that this Court found no standing for\nthe challenge to the Millionaires' Provision in\nMcConnell, and we have a record of actual experience.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose we found -- we were\nof the view that all of the provisions, that the\nbenefits given to the other side here are bad. I\nsuppose we could even -- re-even the playing field by\neither denying those benefits to the candidate opposing\nthe Appellant, the Petitioner here, or we could do the\nopposite and eliminate similar restrictions upon -- upon\nthe Petitioner. Do you have any idea which way we ought\nto go?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: May I answer the question?\nI mean, you're right that to the extent that this says\nthis really sounds as an equal protection case more than\na First Amendment case, at the remedial stage you'd ask\nthe question: Should we level up and have both\ncandidates have a larger cap or should we level down and\nhold them both to the $2300 level?\nI would say two things, if I may. One is\nit's no accident that Appellant isn't asking you to\nlevel up because what -- they're not interested in doing\nadditional financing; they're really taking --\ninterested in taking advantage of keeping the opponent\ndown to the $2300 level.\nThe only other thing that I would say about\nthis choice between leveling up and leveling down is I\nwould say that the statute that would have relaxed the\ncaps for both candidates would pose the same First\nAmendment issue as this statute. And so it really is,\nat bottom, an equal protection claim that you have\nbefore you.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General\nClement.\nMr. Herman, you may take five minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW D. HERMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT\nMR. HERMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nFirst of all, let me answer this -- the\ndiscussion about the quote \"parity principle.\" In this\ncase, Mr. Davis was outspent by $3 million, yet the\nparity principle would have allowed his opponent to\nraise another $1.4 million. The district court has\nnever answered-- never answered that flaw in the\nstatute. I haven't seen any explanation of how that\ncreates parity when the higher fund --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did the money come\nfrom? Was it a war chest left over from prior\ncampaigns?\nMR. HERMAN: For his opponent?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, because he didn't --\nhis opponent did not take advantage of the relaxed\ncontribution limits.\nMR. HERMAN: He went into the election,\nJustice Ginsburg, with about a $1.15 million war chest.\nAnd then he --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because he was just a\ngood fundraiser? That --\nMR. HERMAN: He was a chairman of the NRCC.\nHe was an excellent fundraiser.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can you address Justice\nScalia's question about leveling up and leveling down?\nMR. HERMAN: I would agree with -- with my\nfriend that we have no interest in leveling up. That's\n-- that's -- as an independent candidate, Mr. Davis is\nforgoing, for the vast, vast majority of his funding,\ncontributions from private sources, and he has no\ninterest in fostering higher contribution limits for\nanyone.\nLet me also discuss the intent -- excuse me\n-- the disclosure very briefly. There has been some\ndiscussion about how this is -- it's very similar to\nindependent-expenditure disclosure. It's really not.\nWhat the -- what the statute requires is\nthat a self-financed candidate declare, at the very\nstart of his campaign, whether he intends to spend more\nthan $350,000. That, as the government's brief\nacknowledges, has no analogue in any other disclosure\nprovision, and it serves -- it serves no purpose. It\ndoesn't -- it doesn't inform the electorate of anything\nother than that this gentleman is going to be\nself-financing.\nIt certainly doesn't address corruption.\nIt's simply -- simply harassment of a self-financer\nrequiring them to go on the record --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it advises the other\nside that they should get ready to raise more money.\nMR. HERMAN: That's exactly right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well -- I mean if you say\nall of the rest of the statute is okay, that's certainly\nreasonable. If you're going to let the guy go above the\nlimits that would otherwise apply, it's useful to let\nhim know in advance so he can start, you know, beating\nthe bushes, right?\nMR. HERMAN: Certainly. And then, finally,\nthere is a reference to this -- this is the ultimate\nsoft money. We would submit this is the ultimate hard\nmoney. This is money that was raised by Mr. Davis. He\nearned it. He is entitled to spend it as he wishes, and\nhe is certainly entitled to spend it furthering his\ncandidacy.\nNow, if there are no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you\nMr. Herman.\n"
