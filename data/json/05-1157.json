        "content": "[10:15 a.m.]\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nthis morning in case 05-1157, Credit Suisse Securities\nversus Billing, et al.\nMr. Shapiro.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. SHAPIRO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe pivotal question in this case is whether\nthis Court's decisions in Gordon and NASD require\nimplied antitrust immunity as the district court\nbelieved. And we submit that the answer is yes. The\n'33 and '34 acts were of course passed for the very\npurpose of regulating IPOs and alleged market\nmanipulation. And this Court has referred to these laws\nas the anchor of Federal economic policy in the\nsecurities field. And under these laws the SEC has laid\ndown detailed regulations applicable to the very\npractices that are at issue in this case with active\nsupervision by the SEC and the NASD.\nAnd it has done this with full understanding\nthat syndicated underwriting is inherently concerted\naction. An underwriting requires joint action in\naccumulating information and setting the price of the\noffering along with allotting shares to customers.\nNow the Gordon and NASD cases apply directly\nhere because of the danger of inconsistency and conflict\nwhich the SEC cited. As in cases of this Court in the\npast, like NASD and Gordon and later Trinko, Congress\nrequired this expert administrative agency to take\ncompetition into account when issuing its standards.\nAnd review in antitrust courts across the country would\nonce again raise the danger of false positives and\nconflicts and wasteful redundancy.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did it, did it specifically\nstate that, or is it that or just the principle that all\nFederal agencies have an obligation to --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, no, Your Honor, it is very\nexpress in 75 and then again in the 96. Capital\nformation, investor protection and competition have to\nbe weighed against each other by the SEC, and in Gordon\nthis Court attached great importance to that standard,\nwhich differs from the competition first standard of,\nthe antitrust laws impose.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Shapiro, to what\nextent has the SEC regulated the specific\nvertical restraints that are alleged here?\nMR. SHAPIRO: The SEC regulates the -- the\nalleged tie-ins and it regulates the alleged excessive\ncompensation claims.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And laddering, for\nexample?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Laddering, tying, and\nexcessive compensation. And it's had a number of\nenforcement actions. Its regulation M is focused\nexactly on those practices. It's issued very detailed\nguidance in a document that we attach to our petition\nappendix on what constitutes --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And are we to assume that\nif the allegations are true, which they of course may\nnot be, that this is a violation of the -- of the\nsecurities laws?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well the SEC has said it\ndepends on the circumstances. And they draw very fine\nlines in this area, Your Honor.\nAnd if, in fact, the SEC concludes it is a\ntie-in under its finely calibrated standards, then yes.\nBut that's the critical issue here. It is very easy to\nterm these things excessive compensation or tie-ins, but\nwhen the NASD looked at a real complaint of this sort in\nthe Invemed case it found that there was no excessive\ncompensation and no commercial bribery. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about in this case\nDid the SEC examine that question at all in this case?\nAnd did it take any position?\nMR. SHAPIRO: In this case it took no\nposition on the merit of the underlying claims, but it\nsaid that there would be serious problems if antitrust\nlaw were applied to these allegations. It would\ninterfere with the agency's ability to define what is\nmanipulation and to amend its definitions. It has\nongoing rulemaking proceedings right now addressed to\nthis issue; and it said further that it would discourage\nunderwriters from going up to the line of prohibition,\nwhich is very important in this area.\nBecause if they don't step over the line and\nthey engage in book building conversations, that's\ncritical to setting the right price for the IPO. And so\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How should we, we\nweigh -- Congress is asking with respect to securities,\nprivate securities litigation, Congress looked at that\nand thought some restraint had to be placed on private\nactions, but it didn't do anything with respect to\nantitrust private action.\nMR. SHAPIRO: We think part of the\nrepugnance analysis here should focus on the fact that\nthese securities claims have simply been repleaded as\nantitrust claims. Congress wasn't aware of any problem\nof this sort; nobody had attempted to replead securities\nviolations like tie-ins and excessive compensation as\nantitrust claims. And Congress of course relied --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't, doesn't the\nstatute specifically provide for -- for exactly this\npossibility? Doesn't both the '33 and the '34 act have\na saving other remedies clause?\nMR. SHAPIRO: It doesn't refer to antitrust\ncases. Those were references to state law remedies that\nCongress later contracted with the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Was it -- were those two\nclauses expressly limited to state law remedies?\nMR. SHAPIRO: No. They referred to other\nclaims, Your Honor, but they don't refer to antitrust.\nSo we don't believe --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But do they have to?\nMR. SHAPIRO: We don't believe --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: None of the claims includes\nan antitrust claim on its face.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we think -- we think\nthey don't apply to antitrust, and in Gordon and NASD\nthose same provisions were in place but that didn't\ndeter the Court from finding them --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't even think we\nmentioned them. Did we mention them?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did we mention them in\nthose cases?\nMR. SHAPIRO: I don't believe the Court did.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, maybe we just forgot.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHAPIRO: They -- well, they -- they\ndon't pertain to antitrust. If you look at the history\nof those provisions they are talking about state causes\nof action and there's no reference to antitrust as such\nin them.\nThat's quite different from Trinko where\nthere was an antitrust savings clause that went on in\ndetail about saving the antitrust cause of action.\nThe danger of conflict that the SEC is\ntalking about here is an acute danger to its ability to\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: What happened in respect to\nthe SEC? What about primary jurisdiction? That's what\nI wondered as I read this. Nobody mentions it. But\nthere's certainly a lot of precedent in the area in this\nkind of thing. You ask the agency, have to go to the\nagency, see what they say.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, Your Honor, the reason\nit doesn't get mentioned is in that Gordon the Court\nheld primary jurisdiction was not a fix for this kind of\nconflict. And here the SEC has expressed its opinion in\nits amicus briefs already. The Court is aware of those\npositions laid out in our cert petition --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The allegations in this\nare quite different from Gordon. There you have got a\nhorizontal -- allegedly horizontal agreement. Here you\nhave got a vertical agreement which it seems to me\ndepends on non-disclosure for it work at all. If there\nbeen full disclosure of all these laddering and\nflippings I don't see how in the world you would ever\nget a -- an antitrust violation.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, Your Honor, the conflict\nis different, but it's really quite a more serious\nconflict than it was in Gordon. In Gordon the only\nconcern was the SEC might reinstitute fixed rates in the\nfuture, and it never did that in 30 years. Here the SEC\nsays the conflict goes to our ability to define\nmanipulation and to amend our rules which we're in the\nprocess of doing and we can't have conduct deterred.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Mr. Shapiro,\nyou're doing a good job of defending the SEC's interests\nbut your position goes considerably beyond their\nposition today.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, the SEC in the lower\ncourts advocated dismissal of the complaints; and in the\nSupreme Court, of course, they've -- they've urged for a\nvacator of the lower court decision. And the brief of\nthe SG echoes many of the concerns that the SEC\nexpressed in the lower courts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's why I wonder about\nprimary jurisdiction. You put a burden on the, on the\nplaintiffs to go to the agency and the agency could take\na range of positions. It might say this is absolutely\nunlawful, BUT it's close enough we think an antitrust\ncourt has no business mucking around in this. Or it's\nunlawful and we don't care. Or, it's not -- in which\ncase they could bring their suit. Or it's -- it's not\nunlawful but we don't care, or it's not unlawful and we\ndo care.\nI mean, there is a range of positions they\ncould take which was the purpose of the primary\njurisdiction doctrine, to see in the context of the\nparticular conduct, not general but in the context of\nthe particular conduct, what the agency thought about\nthis in terms of its regulatory mission.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, I think Gordon is very\ninformative on that point. It rejected primary\njurisdiction because the agency's views were already\nknown to the Court. Here the SEC has filed a 40-page\nsubmission in the district court explaining that the\nsuit has to be dismissed because of conflict with the\nadministrative scheme.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's in respect to the\nparticular conduct at issue here.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Absolutely. The particular\nconduct at issue --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course the Petitioners\nhave not had an opportunity, I would think -- they filed\na complaint. But they've not had an opportunity to\nargue this out in front of the SEC with particular\nevidence, with particular witnesses, et cetera.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, what this Court said in\nGordon was that it's a legal question whether there is\npotential interference with the administrative scheme\nfor us to decide the SEC's views are entitled to\nconsiderable deference, the Court said. But if they've\nbeen submitted in the form of amicus briefs, that is\nsufficient to demonstrate the repugnance.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose if primary\njurisdiction were a cure-all, there would never be any\ncases in which the regulatory scheme did not displace\nthe antitrust laws.\nMR. SHAPIRO: That's absolutely right. In\nthat case, where the Court did refer an antitrust issue,\nthe agency declined to take the reference. And\nhere there there was a factual issue the agency was\nsupposed to opine on. Here we have a pure legal\nquestion, the Court has held, of potential repugnance\nwith the SEC scheme. That's for the Court to decide.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The difference between\nthis case and Gordon is that this case, the heart of\ntheir allegations are failure to disclose which is\nquintessentially the SEC's business, making sure\ndisclosures are right. I don't think if there were\ndisclosure, they would have a problem in this case. Am\nI missing something on that?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, what the SEC says is\nthat if the conduct is ordinary book building,\ncommunications about future transactions, at future\nprices, there's no misconduct to be disclosed. It is\nperfectly permissible.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The allegation in the\ncomplaint is there was no disclosure.\nMR. SHAPIRO: The complaint alleges an\nantitrust violation. Just that there was agreement to\nengage in tie-ins, and an agreement not to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The allegation is the\nagreement -- the agreement not to disclose.\nMR. SHAPIRO: That certainly highlights why\nthis is an SEC case and not an antitrust case, it seems\nto me, because that -- disclosure is for this\nadministrative agency to wrestle with, and it has made\nclear that investor welfare will be harmed and issuer\nwelfare will be harmed if these sensitive questions are\ntaken from it and are frozen by antitrust judgments.\nThat was the problem the Court faced in NASD and it was\nthe problem the Court faced in Gordon.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just ask one more\nquestion, Mr. Shapiro. Supposing there had been full\ndisclosure here. Do you think there would be an\nantitrust violation?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, in part, I would say\nyes, there was an agreement in restraint of trade --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Agreeing on what the --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yeah, that's their theory.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The preliminary before the\nIPO. But what they did after the IPO, would that\nviolate the antitrust laws?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Really what they are alleging\nis a conspiracy to violate the securities laws here,\nthat had some -- what they claim, a market effect. And\nit is the agreement that they contend is an unreasonable\nrestraint of trade or they refer to the compensation\npayments as excessive commercial bribes. They say that\nviolates the Robinson-Patman Act.\nThe trouble is no matter how you phrase\nthis, no matter how they could amend their pleading,\ninherent in the case are challenges to tie-ins and\nalleged excessive compensation payments that under the\nsecurities laws have to be regulated by the SEC. The\nGovernment has to speak with one voice on this issue\nunder one set of standards, or administrative law gets\nfrozen. And there's a huge deterrent effect on\nunderwriters.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there many situations\nin which a particular industry is subject to regulators\nand they sometimes conflict? Like EPA and OSHA?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes. Under these two\ndecisions of the Court, NASD and Gordon, there has to be\nactive supervision or pervasive regulation by the\nagency, and then a direct conflict with what the SEC is\ntrying to accomplish.\nThere are a number of things that can be\nregulated even under the antitrust laws under those\nstandards. NASD and Gordon didn't stop all antitrust\nlitigation in its tracks. Only things that were within\nthe agency's supervisory jurisdiction to present --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The EPA is not a hands-on\nregulatory agency the way the SEC is. It has not been\ngiven an entire industry to regulate.\nMR. SHAPIRO: I think that's right, Your\nHonor. The '33 Act, if you look at the Act, every\nprovision in it is focused on IPOs. It is state of the\nart comprehensive legislation. The '34 Act in three\nseparate provisions gives the SEC power to define\nmanipulation. Then it has rulemaking power and then it\nhas exemption power. This is comprehensive. It is far\nmore pervasive than the kind of regulation that was\nbefore the Court in NASD. In that case, there was just\nunexercised rulemaking power. Here we have got\nvoluminous regulations, we have interpretations, we have\nmany enforcement actions aimed at this very same\nconduct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the Government says\nthat's fine where the regulations have been issued, and\nwhere they -- where they render the action here lawful.\nThere's no -- no problemo. What's wrong with that?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, the Government says --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Government's willing,\nin other words, to give the SEC carte blanche. Whatever\nyou say is lawful is lawful that won't violate the\nantitrust laws.\nMR. SHAPIRO: We think immunity extends\nbeyond what is expressly permitted by the SEC. The way\nthe Court phrased it in NASD was things that are\nconnected to the agency's regulatory responsibility have\nto be immunized to allow the agency to do its task. And\nthat extends a little bit further than the permission\nstandard that the Government has given.\nAnd there --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Extends a lot further, I\nwould think.\nMR. SHAPIRO: I would think it does. I\nwould think the NASD case would come out the other way\nunder the standard the SG is using today. But we think\nwe win under the inextricably intertwined standard,\nbecause all of this conduct is closely connected to what\nis permissible. There's a very fine line between what\nis forbidden and what is permitted. They can ask about\nfuture market prices. They can give the IPOs to their\nbest customers, but they can't solicit a transaction in\nthe immediate aftermarket while the IPO is still --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So we could decide that\nway. We could say, we don't have to decide what the\nstandard is, even if it is inextricably intertwined as\nthe Government does, you would win, you would be\nhappy --\nMR. SHAPIRO: We would win under either of\nthese standards. But what we advocate is dismissal with\nprejudice, which is the relief the Court gave in the\nNASD case, and not a shapeless remand of the case for\nfurther pleading. And the reason for that is that the\ninterference would overhang the market. The\ninterference would affect the SEC's ability to lay down\nthe standards and encourage conduct going up to the line\nof prohibition.\nAnd the remedy that the Court approved in\nNASD is exactly appropriate here, dismissal with\nprejudice. These plaintiffs did not even seek to amend\ntheir complaints in the lower courts. Under Second\nCircuit law, they've waived their right to seek an\namendment. So we, in sum, urge the Court to stick with\nits own standards in NASD and Gordon. The standards are\nnot broken. They don't need to be fixed. Nobody has\npointed to any changed circumstances that would warrant\na change in this Court's decisions, and those decisions\nrequire dismissal with prejudice.\nIf there are no further questions, we'd\nreserve the balance of our time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Shapiro.\nGeneral Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING PETITIONERS\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe United States has responsibility for\nenforcing both the securities laws through the SEC and\nthe antitrust laws through the Justice Department and\nthe FTC. It thus has a critical interest in ensuring\nthat these laws can be reconciled in a manner that gives\neffect to both, and completely ousts neither. Any\neffort to try to reconcile those laws in the specific\ncontext of the underwriting of IPOs has to begin with an\nunderstanding of the particular regulatory context and\nscheme. The SEC obviously carefully regulates both the\nregistration and the underwriting process for individual\nIPOs.\nThere are two aspects of that regulatory\nregime that are particularly important: First, the\napproval for all sorts of collaborative conduct that is\nthe hallmark of the underwriting syndicate. And second,\nthe very fine nature of the distinctions that the SEC\ndraws between permissible book building activity and\nimpermissible market manipulation.\nAnd in that regulatory context, the kind of\ncollaborative conduct that would in many other contexts\nraise yellow or red flags of an antitrust violation is\ninnocuous, because it's a hallmark of the underwriting\nprocess.\nEqually important, the SEC does make certain\nconduct like tie-ins and laddering unlawful, but very\nclosely related conduct is not only permissible, but is\nconsidered beneficial to the capital formation process.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question\nabout the laddering and so forth? If it were fully\ndisclosed, would it be unlawful under either statute.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think it might, Justice\nStevens. The prohibitions on laddering and tie-ins are\nnot just disclosure provisions. And I think as a\npractical matter, if these kind of things were\ndisclosed, they probably wouldn't happen. So it's a\nlittle hard to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I can see how they would\naffect the market if they were disclosed.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That may be true, but the\nway the regulation approaches that conduct is a little\nbit more of a prophylactic approach. It's not just a\ndisclosure approach, and it does say that there's\nconduct that is forbidden. But I think it is important\nto recognize just how fine the lines that are drawn here\nbecome, because, to give you a real world example, the\nguidance document that's at page 216A of the petition\nappendix makes clear that it is permissible for the lead\nunderwriter, when talking to customers, to gauge their\ninterest at various price points in the initial\noffering.\nJUSTICE ALITO: In light of the very fine\nline, how is the Court to distinguish between --\ndetermine whether what's alleged is inextricably\nintertwined with authorized conduct?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think if you were\nlooking at a challenge that took place solely within the\ncontext of a single IPO, it would probably be so\ndifficult that I think we would concede that you can't\npractically separate the two. What I think is important\nfrom the standpoint of the Justice Department and its\nantitrust responsibilities is you don't want to sweep an\nimmunity so broad that it would, say, give cover to a\nconspiracy that cut across IPOs, and was an effort to\nfix commission rates, or to make territorial agreements,\nor exclude a rival investment bank from the underwriting\nprocess.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the problem you address\nhas been a problem of strike suits. And it is the\nproblem that Congress addressed in its legislation.\nShake downs. It just is less expensive to pay off the\nsuitor than it is to litigate it to a final conclusion,\nwhere that conclusion is highly uncertain.\nAnd I don't see how your -- your solution of\ninextricably intertwined, where there's a penalty of\ntreble damages if you guess wrong about that line, I\ndon't see how that's going to stop the strike suits any\nmore than the current situation does.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't want to roll the\ndice on whether something is inextricably intertwined,\nwith treble damages at the end.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I\nthink that you could certainly perform this test and\nmake the test protect conduct sufficient to protect\nagainst that threat. We are certainly sensitive to the\nthreat that a regulatory agency is trying to draw a fine\nline between two closely related areas of conduct.\nThey're not going to be able to enforce that line as a\npractical matter if the regulated community knows that\nthe consequence of having a foot fault in crossing that\nline will be treble damages in a class action suit.\nOn the other hand, we would caution against\nadopting some sort of broad immunity that would\npreclude, say, the Justice Department from investigating\nand prosecuting an antitrust conspiracy that cut across\nIPOs. And of course, the Congress has addressed the\nproblem of treble damages directly in a number of areas.\nAnd I suppose, if they were to address the area in the\nantitrust context, they might draw a distinction between\nprivate treble damages suits and Government enforcement\nefforts. Now, that's a little hard to do --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They might, but they\nhaven't yet. A couple of times you've used this phrase\ncutting across IPOs. Are you saying there should be an\nabsolute immunity from antitrust prosecution within a\nsingle IPO?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, I mean,\nI would warn you off of sort of saying absolutely no. I\nthink as a practical matter, though, it is going to be\n-- I mean, I can't conceive of a ready example of where\nan allegation that is specific to an internal single IPO\nwould really be practically inseparable. So I think the\nrole of the antitrust laws will largely be in\nallegations that cut across IPOs.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And even then, why do you\ntake the other position? It is pretty easy to imagine\nthe SEC, under some circumstances, deciding that's a\nproper way to market securities, to have some kinds of\nagreements between IPOs or something like that. I don't\nsee why not.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I suppose it's\npossible, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is possible. I'm back\nto Justice Alito's question. I mean, if you're worried\nabout taking authority from the Department to prosecute\nterritorial restrictions as some kind of blatant price\nfix, that's not in front of us. So this doesn't have to\nbe precedent for that.\nYou're talking about this case. And there,\nI think the Respondent -- the Petitioners here say that\nmy goodness, we don't see any way that a district court\nis going to be able to start talking about whether this\nevidence is protected. What does that mean, protected?\nMaybe protected here, because they have thought about\nit, but there will be a lot of cases where the SEC\nhasn't thought about the particular conduct. We don't\nknow what they're going to prove.\nI'm back to Justice Alito. How is anybody\ngoing to administer the standard that you are asking the\nCourt to enunciate?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think if you draw\na distinction between intraIPO allegations and interIPO\nallegations, you go a long way towards doing it. And I\nshould note, that's basically the line this Court drew\nin NASD.\nIf you look particularly at the part of the\ndecision that deals with count 1 of the Government's\ncomplaint, that was a horizontal allegation. And it was\nall in the context of vertical agreements that were\nspecific to a particular mutual fund.\nAnd in that context, this Court said that\nwith respect to the horizontal agreement, there's\nnothing in the SEC regulations that specifically\naddresses that, but the SEC specifically blesses the\nvertical agreements, so we're going to give additional\nimmunity to that horizontal agreement. That same page,\npage 733 of the opinion, they say, what we don't have\nbefore us is an allegation by the government that there\nis a scheme here to reduce competition between mutual\nfunds. There is no allegation that they were trying to\ncut down, there was an agreement that would cut down\ncompetition between Fidelity and Wellington, for\nexample. It was all in the context of individual funds\nand retarding the secondary market for individual funds.\nThe language the Court used on page 733\nof that opinion seems to us a perfectly reasonable test.\nThe Court said, quote: \"The close relationship is\nfatal\" the close relationship between what the SEC had\nprohibited in the vertical context and what was sought\nto be gone after in the context of the horizontal\nrestraints, those are too closely related. I don't\nthink that test has caused the undue confusion. And I\nthink what it does it makes a reasonable balance between\na ruling that on the one hand preserves a great deal of\nimmunity, but on the other hand doesn't give a kind of\nblanket immunity that would basically completely oust\nthe antitrust laws. And I think that's the balance we\nhope to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What happens on remand in\nthis very case based on your theory? You are not\nadopting the district judge's position that this case\nshould be dismissed outright.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's right,\nJustice Ginsburg, and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What happens when it goes\nback?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think this Court\ncould do one of two things. I mean, the Petitioners for\ntheir part have pointed to in footnote 6 of the blue\nbriefs, to a variety of Second Circuit precedents about\nthe standards for repleading. Perhaps the easiest\ncourse for this Court would be to just vacate and let\nthe Second Circuit apply its own law of repleading.\nThat would be one option. The other option would be --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why, if this is a\nsprawling complaint and if the problem is that it says\ntoo much or too vaguely? A district court doesn't have\nto leave the pleader to its own devices. It can have a\npretrial conference and say, now let's get this whole\nthing in order, and it's not that the pleader is left\nalone to do what he or she will.\nBut in complex cases like this, the district\njudge will often assert control from the beginning and\nnot leave the parties to do what they want.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: We would have no objection\nto that, Justice Ginsburg. And I would say, you know,\nyou might say that, particularly based on the guidance\nthis Court gives in this case and the guidance this\nCourt gives perhaps in the Twombley case, that it might\nbe fair to let the plaintiffs have a crack at making a\nnew complaint in this area. Oh the other hand, as I\nsay, we would have no objection to just allowing the\nSecond Circuit to sort it out based on Second Circuit\npleading law. I think the important thing from our\nperspective --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What would, what would a\nsatisfactory complaint for this party look like?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg,\nit's a little hard for me to frame that complaint. I\nthink if it focused on inter-IPO allegations and,\ncontrary to this complaint, paragraph 42 of this\ncomplaint, actually alleges that there were a variety of\ndifferent mechanisms that were used, that doesn't sound\nlike what you would expect from a disagreement that cut\nacross IPOs. You'd expect uniform conduct to be\nalleged. And if there was that sort of conduct and it\nwas alleged to violate both regulatory regimes in a\nclear way, then maybe it could go forward.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nGeneral Clement.\nMr. Lovell.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LOVELL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. LOVELL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis Court's decisions in NASD and National\nGerimedical determined that implied immunity is not\nfavored, is justified only by a, quote, \"convincing\nshowing of clear repugnancy,\" and then, quote, \"only to\nthe minimum extent necessary,\" close quote. It is not\nnecessary to make the securities laws work to permit a\nconspiracy to engage in conduct that the securities laws\nhave been trying to stop since their inception.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it might well be,\nbecause the reasoning would be, which I find very\nstrong, is that as soon as you make an, bring an\nantitrust court in, you're talking about juries and\ntreble damages. And as soon as that happens, the people\nwho are subject to it stay miles away from the conduct\nthat, in fact, would subject them to liability. And yet\nstaying miles away, they will not engage in conduct\nthat, A, the SEC might believe is permissible, or, B,\nactually favor.\nWhere you get a complex complaint like\nyours, that begins to ring true, that argument. And\nthat's what's concerning me.\nMR. LOVELL: I totally disagree, with great\nrespect. Our complaint is that the conspiracy was to\nrequire laddering in order to develop pools of orders\nright after the stock began trading.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What they say in respect to\nthat is the other side says it's common to try to what's\ncalled make a book or something. I don't know these\nterms.\nMR. LOVELL: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And when they do, what\nhappens is that the marketer goes out and he asks\npeople: What's your plan? What are you thinking of\ndoing next month? What's your plan for this stock?\nHold it? Not? It doesn't require much imagination to\nsee how certain answers to that kind of question could\nbe brought by a plaintiff in perfectly good faith as\nevidence that there's an agreement that next month they\nwill pay more for the stock and next month they'll pay a\nlot more.\nMR. LOVELL: That's not this case, Your\nHonor. That's not this case. We say that the\nunderwriters made a horizontal conspiracy to inflate the\nprices and to inflate their charges as a result by\nrequiring these laddering orders and jointly negotiating\ntogether the amounts of the laddering.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's not saying that that's\nthis case. He's just saying that it's so easy to make\nallegations that action which was perfectly legitimate\namounted to action that was illegitimate. And that\nquestion ultimately gets thrown into the laps of the\njury; and if the jury comes out the wrong way, you get\nhit with treble damages.\nMR. LOVELL: Your Honor, sorry for\ninterrupting.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm done.\nMR. LOVELL: Okay.\nIt's like a lawyer knows what to say and\nknows what not to say. This has been established for\nyears. You cannot say in the securities business, Your\nHonor -- and we don't know this; we know what to do as\nlawyers. You cannot say it's a quid pro quo, I'm going\nto negotiate with you how much you have to purchase.\nThat type of conduct created pools during the 1920s and\nthe early 30s which manipulated prices to unsustainable\nlevels that led to the great stock market crash and\nmaybe the depression. The legislative history said: We\nwant to stop pools. In section 982 of the Securities\nand Exchange Act it says, quote, \"One person or more\ncannot work together to raise prices.\"\nWe allege that the first part of this\nhorizontal conspiracy, across underwriters and across\nIPOs, was to require the laddering in order to raise\nprices.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The problem -- I'd be\nrepeating it. we're not talking about, say, your case.\nI don't know what your evidence is. But let's imagine a\ncase where the evidence of just what you said consists\nof some rather ambiguous discussions which might be\ncharacterized in a variety of ways, including the way\nthe way the plaintiff wants to characterize it, who\nwould repeat the very words you just said.\nNow, the issue, it seems to me here, is in\nlight of that possibility, do we want an antitrust judge\nto say whether that's so? I know you do. Or do you\nwant the SEC to say whether that's so in the particular\ncase? Or that's why I thought of primary jurisdiction:\nMaybe first send it to the SEC.\nWhat's your view?\nMR. LOVELL: Well, I'll do primary\njurisdiction last, Your Honor. My view is that to bring\nin the other case is, in effect, to exculpate antitrust\nviolations. On this narrow case that we've alleged,\nunder Connelly versus Gibson there is no other case.\nAnybody who's charged with murder or any serious conduct\ncould say: Well, you can't really apply that because\nthis is the other case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you if your\nconspiracy allegation would be the same if there were\nonly one underwriter?\nMR. LOVELL: No. No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It is critical to your\ncase that there are multiple underwriters?\nMR. LOVELL: Yes, yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if we thought that\nthe activities of the multiple underwriters were\nComparable to a single joint venture? In many respects\nthey're like a joint venture. Would that mean your\nwhole case could collapse? In other words, I'm really\nwondering to what extent you're depending on your\nhorizontal agreement as opposed to the vertical\narrangements like laddering and flipping and that sort\nof thing.\nMR. LOVELL: We totally depend on the\nhorizontal agreement, Your Honor. The case rises or\nfalls on the horizontal agreement among underwriters to\nrequire that which the securities law --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If there had just been the\nvertical agreements and if they had been fully\ndisclosed, there would no antitrust violation, would\nthere? If there had just been publicly disclosed\nagreement by one underwriter with the purchasers to\nengage in these activities, there would be no violation,\nwould there?\nMR. LOVELL: If there's no market power,\nwe're not alleging that, and we wouldn't try to bring\nthat case, Your Honor. Where the antitrust laws, as\nGeneral Clement says, have their reach is that they get\nthe whole elephant. If we prove that the underwriters\nconspired as we alleged, and there's five administrative\ncomplaints here -- it's not something where it's is a\nstrike suit. There's five administrative complaints\nfinding this parallel unlawful conduct, which would work\nbest through a conspiracy.\nAnd we have our allegations in the complaint\nthat they worked jointly together to do in this case\nwhat's always been prohibited under the securities laws.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the\nSolicitor General's suggestion about extending antitrust\nimmunity to a single IPO? In other words, what's wrong\nwith that? That's where the SEC's regulation seems to\nbe most pervasive, and what you can do in the context of\nan IPO if your allegations cut across IPOs that might be\ndifferent.\nMR. LOVELL: It's a hypothetical. We're not\ntrying to do an individual case. I don't have a strong\nposition on it. There is a case called Roth berg in the\nEastern District of New York -- the Eastern District of\nPennsylvania, a district court case, that recognized an\nantitrust violation in a single stock manipulation.\nThere are other cases called Shumway and -- and I forget\nthe other case -- that said, no, you can't have it.\nThey've gone both ways.\nIt wouldn't matter to our case at all.\nWe're trying to get at -- the securities laws are\ntransactional. They can't get at a big wrong like this.\nThey only get their own part of the elephant. The\nantitrust laws, this is business as usual, step into my\noffice. As General Clement says, the antitrust laws\ncome if we prove that there was a horizontal agreement.\nThen all of these individual efforts --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What are you talking\nabout when you say a horizontal agreement? Are you\ntalking about a group of underwriters in the context of\na single IPO?\nMR. LOVELL: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No.\nMR. LOVELL: No, Your Honor. It's across\nIPOs and across underwriters. They changed their\nbusiness. They all changed the business at about the\nsame time: This is the way we're going to operate.\nWe're going to require the laddering orders. That moves\nthe price up. And we're going to require another type\nof tie-in agreement that allows the underwriters to\nparticipate in the customer's profits from the\ndifference between the IPO price and the inflated prices\nat which transaction sales were made right after the\nIPO.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about an agreement\namong underwriters, among underwriters, which says the\nfollowing: We agree that we go -- when we go on our\ntour, we will be certain to ask the potential purchasers\nwhether they plan to hold this stock for at least a\nmonth.\nMR. LOVELL: No problem.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No problem.\nMR. LOVELL: Never.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How do you know that isn't\na disguise when they say --\nMR. LOVELL: We wouldn't bring the case,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah, ah. What they've said\nwas -- you see, they have the same allegations. I don't\nknow how to -- you see what I'm driving at?\nMR. LOVELL: Yes. Yes, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's the answer?\nMR. LOVELL: I don't think it fits into the\nway of this narrow case and the facts that are presented\nfor immunity here, which the Congress has been trying to\nstop forever, and the conduct's spread between 1997 and\n2001 and was a massive violation that the securities\nlaws really aren't cut out to address. I know I'm\ngetting off your question a little bit, but in the\nNASDAQ antitrust litigation these defendants and their\npredecessors agreed to keep the spreads wide in\nthe over-the-counter market. There were rules about\nmaximum spreads. There were many rules, many\nregulations.\nHowever, it was never permitted in the\nsecurities markets for all the underwriters across 5,000\nstocks -- we only proved it out to 1600 -- to widen\ntheir spreads, to keep their bids and offers wide.\nBillions of dollars -- the Justice Department after we\nbrought the case, the Justice Department brought a case.\nThe entire industry was changed. You can now trade a\nmillion dollars worth of stock for less than it costs to\nchange your tire or something. And it's all due to the\nantitrust -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm trying to grasp\nthe difference between the single IPO and multiple. So\nin response to Justice Breyer's hypothetical, they all\nagree in the context of a single IPO, let's make sure\neveryone's going to hold the stock for a month, and you\nsay no problem.\nMR. LOVELL: No problem.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if the same\nunderwriters get together the next month, they've got a\ndifferent IPO and they say, you know, let's do the same\nthing we did last time because seemed to work well in\nterms of the issuance and the capital formation. All of\na sudden that's an antitrust problem?\nMR. LOVELL: No. The basis for my answer is\ntwo levels of no problem. There's not a problem as to\nthe single deal and there's not a problem as to saying\nyou have to hold the stock. That's not at issue. We\nhave no problem with that.\nWhat's always been prohibited is to create\npools of orders to drive up the price of the stock. If\nyou work to raise the price of the stock, which this was\nall geared to do, after it came public, it drives prices\nto unsustainable levels. It creates a lot of action in\nthe stock. People come in and buy. Our clients buy\ndirectly from the defendants who are driving the stock\nup. And yes, there was no disclosure. As with any\nantitrust conspiracy, if there was disclosure there\ncould have been --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you get damages for\nthat from the SEC? I mean, it sounds like bad conduct.\nMR. LOVELL: The SEC refers the customers to\nthe private lawyers if you complain. The securities\nlaws are totally different from the ICC, from the common\ncarrier case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you lose, your\nclient -- suppose all these bad things happen and you\ndon't have an antitrust claim. Is there somewhere in\nthe law that you can get damages?\nMR. LOVELL: Yes.\nWhere?\nMR. LOVELL: The specific intent of Congress\nin creating the securities laws was to create private\nremedies which are available, and to preserve all other\nremedies, including --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what's at issue here is\nnot whether you get a remedy. It's whether you get\ntreble damages.\nMR. LOVELL: No. Theoretically, there are\nother remedies as to each individual client for what\neach individual client did. No one can address in a\nsecurities case the wrong that happens here. The\nagreement. That can only be addressed as\nGeneral Clement says at page 22 of the brief, through an\nantitrust case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that? I don't\nunderstand why the SEC could not -- they can make rules\nfor a single IPO; it seems to me they can make rules for\ncoordination of IPO. Why can't they do that?\nMR. LOVELL: Well, the SEC could make a rule\nto prohibit -- to further supplement the protections.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right, right.\nMR. LOVELL: Yes, Your Honor. They could\nsupplement the prohibitions --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They have chosen not to.\nMR. LOVELL: Well, it -- it -- I think it's\nmore institutional that the focus has always been\ntransactional, Your Honor. And the Congress clearly in\n982 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 clearly\nprohibits individual or joint efforts to raise prices,\nempowers private investors to sue, empowers the SEC to\nsue --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but --\nMR. LOVELL: There could have been a suit by\nnow but it has never happened.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you -- you could regard\nthe activity of laddering and of making a book on a\nstock when the -- in the case of a single offering. You\ncould -- you could look upon that as, as an attempt to\nraise the price. That's what it is, isn't it? An\nattempt to make sure there's going to be a high enough\nprice for the stock so that it won't flop once it's out\nthere?\nMR. LOVELL: In the -- there's huge\nqualitative differences between certain types of conduct\nwhich has always been accepted and was not prohibited in\nthe securities laws and laddering or pools of orders to\nraise prices and tie-in agreements. The only metaphor I\ncan throw out, Your Honor, is that we know how far we\ncan say and what we can't say, the brokers always know\nthis, until 1997 to 2001 when they -- they changed their\nunderwriting businesses to go -- and we, we allege that\nthey required, induced, solicited -- not that they did\nthings on the way -- close to the line or -- in the,\nwhat had always been the accepted area, the world\nchanged. And that change moved into the territory that\nhad -- sorry for hurrying -- that had always been\nprohibited.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah. And you're saying\nthey did this just -- not in the context of just single\nIPOs, but that they agreed across IPOs that they would\nall do this.\nMR. LOVELL: Yes, Your Honor, across IPOs\nand across underwriters, so that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why?\nMR. LOVELL: So that a customer couldn't go\nto another underwriter for a different deal.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Uh-huh. The customer being\nthe issuer?\nMR. LOVELL: No, no. The public customers\nwho have accounts with the underwriters; they're also\nbrokerage firms. If they wanted to get an IPO in what\nwe call class security, the technologies securities,\nthey had to pay --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They'd have to pay the\npremium.\nMR. LOVELL: Yeah. They had to pay these\nunlawful charges under securities laws, no matter where\nthey went. And in terms of the inextricably\nintertwined, it is the qualitative difference that stops\nthat.\nI think behind the Solicitor General and the\nSEC's proposal is a fear that the syndicates, the\nunderwriters are vulnerable to an antitrust case because\nthey operate together. That's not true. There's never\nbeen a case precisely like this; and the underwriters as\nbrokers, as market makers, they operate together and\ncooperatively all the time. Five years goes by. Seven\nyears goes by. There's no antitrust case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So what are the\nwords you use in the opinion, that would separate your\ncase, where it is like price fixing and so forth, to\ncharge them, from the case that they're worried about,\nwhich is where the evidence is, to prove the allegation\nis, really involves activity that could be quite\nlegitimate?\nNow, now -- what words would I write in the\nopinion that in your opinion would separate the sheep\nfrom the goats?\nMR. LOVELL: They agreed to inflate prices\nin precisely the way the securities laws have always\nprohibited. They agreed to inflate prices and they\nagreed to make tie-in agreements that have always been\nprohibited under the securities laws, to participate in\nthe profits from the inflated prices, which they were\nnot permitted to participate in.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your test is it\nhas to be prohibited by the securities laws?\nMR. LOVELL: No. But in this narrow case,\nit happens to be that the method that they went to,\nwhich was always a guaranteed method to drive up prices\nand to participate, was -- had always been prohibited by\nthe securities laws.\nIt is not the test. The test for the\nantitrust claim is merely this: they wanted to make an\nagreement to inflate prices and they wanted to make an\nagreement to inflate their charges. And if a customer\ncame to this underwriting trust at the time to deal with\nthem, they had to do this type of transaction to inflate\nthe price, and they had to pay the underwriting extra --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you say to\nthe -- sort of stepping back from the trees to the\nforest, to the general suggestion that Congress has been\ntightening up the requirements for private securities\nlitigation over the past few years; and you're bringing\nthis now as antitrust claims as a way to circumvent\nCongress's regulation.\nMR. LOVELL: That the actual facts show that\nCongress wanted this claim to be brought. Certain --\nCongress is well aware of the NASDAQ antitrust\nlitigation and of the Salomon Brothers antitrust\nlitigation, both antitrust claims in the securities\nmarkets. Both situations where the diligent\nprofessionals at the SEC were criticized by the\ncongressional oversight people for not finding out what\nwas going on, perhaps, and that the antitrust bar did\nand brought the case, and then the DOJ brought it and\nthen there was questions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about -- what about --\nlisten to what I'm about to say. I'm thinking of the\nstandard.\nThe standard would be where the allegations\nare such, where the case is such that -- to go\nfurther -- that, one, it is an allegation of a claim of\nillegality; is price fixing, in price fixing; and it is\nof longstandingly prohibited under the securities law;\nand there is evidence to support that, of -- strong\nevidence to support it, or the evidence in support\nthereof is not primarily evidence simply of asking the\njury to draw inferences from conduct that is protected.\nUnder those circumstances there is no immunity.\nMR. LOVELL: Bingo. That -- we live with\nall that, Your Honor. To quote -- sorry, sorry.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know if it's -- I\nmean, you know --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LOVELL: No, no - but we agree on every\none. But to go back --\nJUSTICE ALITO: How could the Court -- how\ncould a court enforce that at the 12(b)(6) stage?\nDetermining whether there's strong evidence of one type\nor another.\nMR. LOVELL: Well, in this particular case,\nYour Honor, there's five administrative proceedings that\nhave, that have come forth since we -- we filed first,\nand there was nothing. And -- but since then there have\nbeen a lot of administrative proceedings. I would say\nthat the fact that parallel unusual -- unlawful conduct\nis occurring in a way that the horizontal people who are\ndoing it inflate their prices at the expense of the\npublic, would satisfy any test.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Look, the question isn't\nwhether it satisfies it. The question is whether you\ncan get rid of this suit at the outset or do you have to\ngo through enormously expensive discovery, which --\nwhich isn't worth the candle.\nMR. LOVELL: Your Honor, I think you have --\nfor the good of the country, I think you have to follow\nthe facts and find out if these people conspired as\nalleged.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- discovery? Right?\nMR. LOVELL: Yes. Sure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the problem --\nthe problem is that, of course, these people are to some\nextent under the securities laws in the business of\nfixing prices. They get together as a syndicate, a\nsyndicate, and say well, you have to figure out what\nprice we're going to charge for this initial public\noffering. It looks, if you didn't understand the\ncontext, it would look an awful lot like an antitrust\nviolation.\nAnd the problem is, I guess, that -- that\nwhen you take that type of evidence, the type of\nevidence you're going to be relying on to show that\nthere's price fixing, it is exactly what the SEC wants\nthe people to do. They want them to get together. They\nwant them to agree on an appropriate IPO price that's\ngoing to contribute to capital formation and everything\nelse.\nAnd how do you at, as Justice Alito pointed\nout, at the 12(b)(6) stage, how is a district court\nsupposed to say well, this is the bad price fixing, this\nisn't the good price fixing?\nMR. LOVELL: Again it is the qualitative\ndifference. Everybody knows -- and the SEC does want\nIPO prices to be fixed, just like in the NASD case, they\nonly wanted one price for the mutual fund shares because\npeople could be disadvantaged. However, everybody also\nknows under Section 982 and Section 17 of the Securities\nAct, that you don't go over and rig the after market,\nnot even in one stock, let alone what we allege, across\nstocks. And with regard to the question earlier, Your\nHonor, about how Congress --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think you've\nanswered his question.\nMR. LOVELL: Oh, I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think that you've said\nthat the two were different. His question was how can\nyou tell at the outset, at the 12(b)(6) stage, the\ndifference between those two things that you've\nmentioned? Sure they're different but -- but the\nevidence that is only evidence of the one also looks\nlike evidence of the other.\nMR. LOVELL: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What is the particular\ndifference between supporting the price and rigging the\naftermarket? I mean, how do we tell that at the\n12(b)(6)?\nMR. LOVELL: You look, you compare the cases\nto the language in the complaint. In paragraphs 4 and 5\nof the complaint we say that they agreed to require\nladdering, they agreed to require this. We don't say\nthat they made any -- any hints or legitimate activity.\nWe're held to that burden of proof. You look at the\ncases, required has always been unlawful. To require a\npool of orders to drive up the prices -- always\nunlawful.\nAnd Congress during the 1990s did narrow the\nsecurities laws; and they took away treble damages as to\nRICO, and they stopped resorting to state court, where\nthe standards weren't as stringent as under the PS law\n-- for class action. However, they knew about these\nantitrust cases that had saved billions of dollars for\nconsumers. They applauded them. And they reenacted the\nsavings clause that says all rights and remedies are\npreserved.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How did they applaud\nthem?\nMR. LOVELL: Well, they just said that they\n-- Congress -- that's too strong a statement. The\nspecific Congress people involved were glad that the --\nthe wrongdoing was uncovered and said as much and wrote\nto the Attorney General, and the SEC, and said why --\nwhy wasn't it found sooner?\nBut they did not touch these antitrust\nactions. Number one, they come very infrequently.\nNumber two, they've done great benefit for the\nsecurities markets and for the participants in the\nsecurities markets, and even for the defendants\nthemselves. They forced the defendants to operate by\ntalent and bring out their best, and not resort to what\nthe problems for the public always is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The SEC which is the\nagency charged with supervising those markets, thinks\notherwise.\nMR. LOVELL: No -- no.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They don't think\nthese, the antitrust actions are good for the securities\nmarkets.\nMR. LOVELL: The SEC -- and this is the\nfirst immunity case before the court where the SEC and\nthe DOJ both are in favor of not having substantive\nimmunity. They both oppose immunity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that wasn't the SEC's\nposition below, was it?\nMR. LOVELL: No. No, it was not, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the Justice Department\nwas on one side, the SEC was on the other. Right?\nMR. LOVELL: Yes, Your Honor. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It looks to me like they\nsplit the baby up here.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LOVELL: I -- I -- that's the only way I\ncan see it. But if Your Honor looks at the questions\nthat the SEC answered to Second Circuit, the SEC said\nthey couldn't say how the current laws couldn't work on\nthe facts of this case, but future cases might present a\ncloser case, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would always -- I think\nthe standard I was more or less talking about is pretty\nclose to what the SG says. And I think he says that --\nthat -- that Justice Alito's point, which is certainly a\ngood point, is that you would have to allege facts such\nthat it was clear from the face of the complaint that\nyou weren't resting your case on the conduct that was --\nthat's what he means by protected -- and there's an\nongoing obligation, it says, on the part of the district\njudge to be sure that the case isn't really growing out\nof this conduct that is arguably okay.\nMR. LOVELL: Protected conduct. And we\ncould live with --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You, you could live with\nthe SG --\nMR. LOVELL: We could live with that. On\nthe other hand, applied immunity is an affirmative\ndefense. It was held in Cantor versus Detroit Edison,\n428 US 579, which didn't make it into our brief, that\napplied antitrust immunity is an affirmative defense.\nAs we brief, there's a long line of cases from Your\nHonors that say that you don't have to plead in the\ncomplaint to negate an affirmative defense.\nI don't think that unlawful conduct under\nthe securities laws is entitled to more protection than\nfree speech or some of the conduct in these other cases;\nand I -- and we've opposed the inextricably intertwined\nstandard as particularly inappropriate where an\naffirmative defense is involved.\nNonetheless, we could live with that, if it\ncame down. And we think the complaint already lives\nwith it. The complaint has, from paragraph 53 through\nparagraph 63, a number of allegations of joint conduct\nto do things which are clearly unlawful under the\nsecurities laws. It does have one allegation about\nholding road shows. On its own, that's permissible. We\ndon't have a footnote that says this is permissible on\nits own. That may have caused somewhat of the problem\nfor -- for people.\nBut reading the complaint as a whole,\nparagraph 5 says that these later paragraphs I just\nreferred to show how the time in the syndicates was\nabused.\nAnd I'm going back to this vulnerability\npoint. The defendants are vulnerable to an antitrust\nclass action plaintiffs saying, you conspired. Yes.\nBut it only happens -- it only happens once in a while.\nAnd think about it. If they abuse their time in the\nsyndicates to create a conspiracy of this nature, to do\nsomething that's always been prohibited under the\nsecurities laws, and it's clearly prohibited under the\nantitrust laws, why should we bend over backwards to\nprotect that every five years or seven years? The\nnormal --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You didn't have a chance\nto answer Justice Breyer's question about primary\njurisdiction. Let's get the SEC's views first of\nwhether there is any interference with securities law\nenforcement.\nMR. LOVELL: The public carrier cases, the\nInterstate Commerce Commission, the sea carriers and the\nair carriers have had primary jurisdiction as an\napproach. In order to keep it uniform, they kept the\nrate and then there would be questions on the rate. So\nboth for administrative discretion and factfinding, the\nCourt said that's their baby, we're going to stay out.\nThe securities laws have always been totally\ndifferent. The antitrust laws - it was a little bit\npatterned after the antitrust laws. Section 9(e) is\nlike the antitrust laws, 15 U.S.C. 15. the antitrust\nlaws said we want private attorney generals to go out\nand sue. The securities laws said we want to give the\nremedies under this act, new remedies. We want to\npreserve -- preserve all other remedies, any and all\nother remedies.\nThe single damages point raised by the\ndefendants in the same section is only a limit on\nrecovery. It's not a limit on the rights and remedies.\nSo the answer to primary jurisdiction is that it's\nalways worked this way, that the private plaintiff is\nsupposed to sue in court. He's expressly empowered\nunder securities laws to sue in court, As he's expressly\nempowered under the antitrust laws, and the courts have\nalways resolved the issue.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but we haven't had this\nproblem focus before, and isn't primary jurisdiction the\nmost efficient answer to the problem that we've got? In\nother words, isn't it time to do something different?\nMR. LOVELL: No, I don't believe so, Your\nHonor. The times that it's come up before in the NASDAQ\ncase, United States versus Morgan, the courts have said\nbusiness as usual. They used the usual implied immunity\nstandard and they resolve it, as usually happens. In\nRichey, the Richey case and a few other cases we've\neither said -- not implied immunity, but we've either\nsaid we're not going to get involved, it's the agency's,\nit's the ICC's responsibility, or it was referred one\ntime in the Richey case to the old Commodity Exchange\nCommission, which then declined to take the referral\nbecause -- that was an appropriate referral because it\nhad to do with the exchange rules.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what\nhappens with this primary jurisdiction in the context of\nan antitrust suit. You're entitled to a jury trial in\nthe antitrust suit, right?\nMR. LOVELL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And in primary\njurisdiction, would we refer it to the SEC and accept\nthe SEC's fact determinations and then instruct the jury\nthat --\nMR. LOVELL: Never happened before, and it's\ncontrary to the -- what Congress wants. In a different\nstatutory context, it was what Congress wanted for\nuniformity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it is really the\nfactual determination that is the hang-up, that you\ndon't want things that are innocent and that the SEC\nwould know are innocent to be taken as evidence of\nguilty by the jury. So you really haven't accomplished\na whole lot if you just send it over to the SEC for\nrulings on the law as opposed to rulings on whether this\nparticular conduct violated the law.\nMR. LOVELL: I agree, Your Honor.\nI think that the presence here of the SEC\ncomplaints, the SEC's fact-finding, saying that things\ngot out of hand during this time and the law was broken\non a widespread basis, indicate that we are not coming\nforth with weak facts. And I also agree that in the\nsecurities context, primary jurisdiction has not had the\nbasis it's had in other legislative contexts where\nuniformity was desired.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Lovell.\nMr. Shapiro, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nSTATEMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SHAPIRO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe key question in this litigation is who's\ngoing to design what a tie-in is and who's going to\ndecide what constitutes unreasonable compensation. The\nplaintiffs say quite overtly in their briefs these\nissues can't be left in the hands of the SEC. Well,\nCongress put these issues in the hands of the SEC.\nThere are three separate provisions that give the SEC\npower to define what is forbidden manipulation, what is\na forbidden tie-in, and what is excessive compensation.\nThe SEC this Court has said is an agency\nthat Congress had considerable confidence in in the\nGordon case and that confidence is well justified here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's your test,\nMr. Shapiro?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Our test is the one the Court\nlaid down in those two cases: Is there active\nsupervision or is there pervasive regulation? If the\nanswer is yes to either of those, you ask, is there a\npotential conflict, and if so immunity applies and the\ncomplaint has to be dismissed. And this is true whether\nyou're talking about one IPO or an agreement that cuts\nacross several IPOs, because even in the multiple IPO\nsituation the jury would still have to decide, was that\na tie-in or was it something innocent; was it\nunreasonable compensation or was it something that was\nproper?\nJUSTICE BREYER: We all agree, say a group\nof underwriters, that for the next we will insist that\nevery customer, whatever price we charge, will pay 30\npercent more for 50 percent more shares next month.\nAbsolutely illegal, isn't it?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They write it down, just\nwhat I said.\nMR. SHAPIRO: The same circumstances were\npresented very similar to the NASD in the Invemed case.\nThey had a Three-week trial, 17 experts, and they\nconcluded that those charges were quite permissible\nconsidering the whole range of services that were given.\nNow, if this occurred with concerted action the SEC has\npower to deal with concerted action. Congress said that\nthey could deal with multiple party manipulations. They\nhave many cases where they proceeded against multiple\nparties.\nIn the NASD case the claim was that there\nwas a horizontal conspiracy involving many brokers and\nmany underwriters, it was industrywide, it went on for\nyears and years. And the Government argued there it was\nimproper, it was contrary to the SEC's policies this.\nThis Court held squarely that that is within the SEC's\npower to regulate and if something of that sort is\noccurring the SEC can deal with it.\nThe test there wasn't whether it was\nconnected to something that was permissible. The test\nwas whether it was connected to the SEC's regulatory\nresponsibilities and the SEC could deal with that sort\nof concerted action on an industrywide basis.\nNow, Mr. Lovell has argued that the conduct\nhas always been forbidden. He labels it that way.\nThere are many case from this Court that we cite in our\nreply brief holding that that labeling does not defeat\nimmunity because it's always possible to characterize\nconduct in that fashion. But the agency has to apply\nits expertise to decide what is forbidden and to change\nits rules over time, which the SEC is now doing. And it\nhas to be able to prevent, deterring conduct that comes\nup to the line of prohibition. Here that conduct is\nessential to protect investors and to protect issuers.\nThe markets couldn't function efficiently if\nunderwriters could not engage freely in the kinds of\nconversations that get twisted in this litigation into\nsomething characterized as tie-ins.\nNow, there are 310 private suits now pending\nunder the securities laws brought by many of these same\nlawyers, making the same claims of concerted action to\nmanipulate the stock market. Those suits are subject to\na panoply of safeguards that Congress has prescribed,\nincluding single damages, restrictions on class action\nabuse, serious loss causation requirements.\nThe only purpose for stretching the\nantitrust laws here is to evade all of the safeguards\nthat Congress has passed, each and every one of them.\nWe think NASD and Gordon are very important in\npreventing that kind of a pleading tactic.\nAnd of course, when counsel talks about\nconcerted action and manipulating the stock market, what\ndid Congress pass the '34 Act for if it wasn't that?\nThere were extensive hearings about concerted\nmanipulation involving pools and groups that were\nmanipulating the market. That's why there are several\nanti-manipulation provisions in the '34 Act that give\nPower to define the misconduct and to deal with it\neffectively. And this is the toughest cop in\nWashington, the SEC. They're perfectly capable of\ndealing with this.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Shapiro.\nMR. SHAPIRO: We thank the Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is now\nsubmitted.\n[Whereupon, at 11:16 a.m. the case in the\nabove entitled matter is submitted.]\n17:6 address 20:22 34:1,4,15,20
