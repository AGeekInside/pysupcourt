        "content": "(11:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board\nof Education.\nMr. Gordon.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TEDDY B. GORDON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GORDON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCrystal Meredith wanted to do what most moms\nand dads do all across this country. She wanted to put\nher son's hand in hers and walk around the corner and\nenroll her son in school.\nBut the enrollment, there was a barrier, and\nthe pickaxe, that barrier was person satisfied as a\nquota. There were seats within the school. It wasn't\nat capacity. It wasn't near any one of the percentages\nor tipping percentages that the quota system in\nJefferson County public schools applied. But she was\nnot allowed in.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that because she\napplied 4 months late? If she had applied before the\ndeadline in March, would you be here? Would there be\nany issue?\nMR. GORDON: Well, of course, Justice\nGinsburg, she moved into the system in August. When she\nmoved into the system, she was assigned to a school\ncalled Breckenridge-Franklin, which was an all year\nround school. Then she was -- her choice was managed\nand she was sent an hour away from where her other\nschool is. She applied by transfer, which is the system\nthat you use.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where was she living\nbefore?\nMR. GORDON: I think she was living in\nFlorida, and she moved into Kentucky.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So she -- that was --\nAugust was the first opportunity she had to apply?\nMR. GORDON: Yes. So that's across the\nboard. Anyone that moves in, they are -- there is a\ncluster school or an attempt school, and if you are not\n-- a majority of the time you are not allowed there\nbecause of your race. In other words, they want to\nassign children to schools that don't have the greater\npercentages of either African-American or Caucasian. So\nin Bloom Elementary, although it was 67-33 -- and keep\nin mind in kindergarten, according to their own rules\nand regulations, didn't even apply. The plan was so\ninflexible --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But she, she could\nhave -- if she had been there at the deadline, the child\nwould have been admitted to -- if she had been there in\nMarch instead of August?\nMR. GORDON: But the deadline applies to\nthat school which presumably is closest to one's\nresidence. Now, whether or not you get into that school\nor don't get into the school still depends on the quota.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we're past that.\nWhen she didn't get the assignment that she requested\nfor her son --\nMR. GORDON: Sure.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- did she appeal that?\nMR. GORDON: She filed a transfer. The\ntransfer was denied. And at that time, litigation had\ncommenced and because litigation had commenced -- and\nroutinely these appeals are denied. All of her efforts\nwere futile.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about for first\ngrade? Did she make an application for first grade?\nMR. GORDON: Me understanding is that she\ndid. That was denied, because the only time Joshua got\ninto --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's in the record,\nthat she made an application for the first grade?\nMR. GORDON: I believe it is. I believe it\nis. In either event, if she didn't it would have been\nfutile because we had already made her the third amended\ncomplaint on behalf of all the parties, and we had asked\nfor injunctive relief within the litigation. But Joshua\ndid not get into the school because of -- until they\nmoved. They had to move a block away. So if you live\nin one block and you can't get into that school, your\nchoice is managed. The plan was clearly inflexibility\nand it didn't apply to kindergarten anyhow, but it still\ncaused our Joshua to go an hour away from his home.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have a claim\nfor damages as well.\nMR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With respect to this\nplaintiff?\nMR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor. I believe\nit's the third amended complaint, the May 2nd complaint,\nand there was a request for $25,000 damages.\nAnd within these schools, in other words,\nthis honorable Court has never applied, other than in\nremedial, has never applied compelling interest in a K\nthrough 12 setting. In fact, those rights are not\nco-extensive. The school -- this honorable Court has\npreviously stated in, for example, the Hazelwood case,\nwhich was a First Amendment right case, that that didn't\napply to K through 12, or should it be 1 through 12\nsetting.\nAnd in the Hazelwood case, that was a basic\nFirst Amendment right and of course the First Amendment\nright was exactly what Justice Powell championed as\nacademic freedom within the Bakke case. So clearly\nBakke and Grutter are distinguishable. This falls into\nGratz, where you clearly have a quota, not less than 15\nor greater than 50 percent, is totally inflexible as\napplied to our --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does it compare with\nthe system that was in effect from, what was it, 1975\nuntil 2000?\nMR. GORDON: I'm sorry. It's the same\nremedial program that -- this Court has found even in\nDowd that when the remedial program has achieved its\nresult we should no longer carve out that exemption\nunder the Equal Protection Clause.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you think that there's\nsomething of an anomaly there, that you have a system\nthat is forced on the school, that it doesn't want it,\nworks for 25 years, and then the school board doesn't\nhave to keep it any more, but it decides it's worked\nrather well, so we'll keep it.\nWhat's constitutionally required one day\ngets constitutionally prohibited the next day. That's\nvery odd.\nMR. GORDON: Well, I take issue that it\nworked very well. In other words, did the Jefferson\nCounty --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The board decided it\nliked the way things were going, so it kept it or\nsomething close to it.\nMR. GORDON: Well, of course Brown versus\nTopeka Board of Education was time applicable. If you\nuse time applicable now for the Jefferson County Public\nSchools --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm talking about the\nplan that they've had for 25 years, and they decided to\nkeep it.\nMR. GORDON: And in the Hampton case, which\nI won, all right, they didn't go to any race-neutral\nalternatives at all. As Justice Kennedy pointed out --\nI'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Gordon, in responding\nto Justice Ginsburg's question, don't you have to deal\nwith the fact that this Court said in the second Swann\ncase that the -- that a school district, particularly a\nschool district like Swann which had been in violation,\nhad been found in violation, had the same interest after\nunitary status had been attained in maintaining the\nunitary status as it had in reaching unitary status\nbeforehand; that if those interests are identical why\ndoesn't it follow that the means to achieve those two\ninterests, unitary status from segregation in one case,\npreservation of unitary status in the other, are\nreasonable if they are identical?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, this\nCourt over and over again has said once a remedial plan\nis accepted there should be race-neutral alternatives\nunder the narrow and tailored requirement. What this\nschool board did after I won --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Race-neutral alternatives\nfor what? To accomplish what?\nMR. GORDON: To accomplish the same means.\nIn other words, what they could have done, as\nJustice Kennedy pointed out, was put more magnet\nschools, more traditional schools, have more open\nenrollment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Gordon, isn't it the\ncase that once you've achieved unitary status, which\nmeans that the effects of past intentional\ndiscrimination have been eliminated, the only way you\ncan lose unitary status is to discriminate\nintentionally? Isn't that right?\nMR. GORDON: Certainly. That's the Dow\ncase, that says you no longer --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And isn't there a\ndistinction between unitary status and unitary\ncondition? Unitary condition is a descriptive\nsituation. It describes a district in which there is,\nin fact, enough of a racial mix so that there is no\ncredible claim either that there is de facto or de jure\nsegregation; isn't that correct? There is such a thing\nas unitary, a unitary condition?\nMR. GORDON: Certainly.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And is the preservation of\na unitary condition a legitimate or indeed a compelling\ngovernmental objective?\nMR. GORDON: In Hampton, this -- our Court\nfound that it was unitary status as opposed to unitary\ncondition.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Uh-huh.\nMR. GORDON: If you want to go with unitary\ncondition, then I still think you go back to Brown and\nyou say has it worked. In other words, let's make it\ntime applicable. Does this honorable Court --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you mean, it\ndoesn't work? I don't understand.\nMR. GORDON: It hasn't worked. It just\nabsolutely hasn't worked. So we've decided --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't understand what it\nis that hasn't worked.\nMR. GORDON: Why do we have to choose\nbetween diversity and educational outcome? I thought it\nwas supposed to be both. Why can't we have diverse --\nwhy can't we have them both. It's not diversity or\neducational outcome. It's diversity and educational\noutcome. For 30 years in this country --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I think that's what your\nfriends on the other side are arguing.\nMR. GORDON: No. The friends on the other\nside are arguing that there's some type of improvement\nin educational outcome solely because you sit black\nchildren next to white children.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Not an improvement exactly,\nbut maybe from the Constitution's point of view. That\nConstitution wanted, as they said in the Slaughterhouse\ncases, to take people who had formerly been slaves and\ntheir children and make them full members of American\nsociety. And part of that was that the State couldn't\ninsist that they go to separate schools.\nNow, the question from a constitutional\npoint of view that you're being asked is how could that\nConstitution which says that this is intolerable, that\nsegregated school, and insist that the school boards in\nSwann and elsewhere take the black children and white\nchildren and integrate them? How could the Constitution\nthe day that that decree is removed tell the school\nboard it cannot make that effort any more, it can't do\nwhat it's been doing, and we'll send the children back\nto their black schools and their white schools?\nThat I take it is why the Court in Swann\nsaid explicitly that you could use race as a factor in\nthe public schools when the school board so chooses.\nNow, that's the general question that I think\nJustice Ginsburg began and Justice Souter was following\nit up. And I would appreciate your response.\nMR. GORDON: My response is that you have\nthose series of cases that say once you've achieved the\nunitary status, you know longer get to carve out that\nexemption to the Fourteenth Amendment, and if we're\ngoing to carve out these exemptions to the Fourteenth\nAmendment, if we're going to say we're going to not\napply Gratz where it's a quota system and we are solely,\nwithout any type of individual holistic review applied\nto these kids, then there should be some improvement in\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How would you apply a\nholistic review to a kindergartner?\nMR. GORDON: Well, of course this system\ndidn't apply to kindergarten anyhow. But the answer is\nit's not. You have to decide.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I can understand an\napproach to an applicant for an elite school and so you\njudge it on all these merit factors and other factors.\nBut for a child entering the first grade, I don't\nunderstand this individualized holistic approach. What\nelse is there other than that the child is of a certain\nage and therefore will enter a certain grade?\nMR. GORDON: That it would violate your\nruling in Gratz --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I want to know -- you\nsaid that there are alternate, alternative means, so I'm\nasking what they are.\nMR. GORDON: Out of Hampton, there was no\nrace-neutral -- race alternative means used. For me, I\nwould use all these millions of dollars. I would reduce\nteacher-student ratio. I would -- I would give\nincentive pay to the better teachers. I would more\nmagnet schools, more traditional schools. We presuppose\nthat we're going to have bad schools and good schools in\nthis country. I don't think we can no longer, longer\naccept that.\nWe can no longer accept an achievement gap\nof 25 to 30 points by the majority of African American\nkids in Jefferson County, Kentucky, and throughout this\ncountry by the fourth grade. Educational outcome is the\nonly key, the only key to unlock the chains of poverty.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it's not that white\nchildren and black children are no longer sitting\ntogether on the same school benches?\nMR. GORDON: Then let's make sure they go to\nthe better schools. In Jefferson County, Kentucky,\nracial politics is involved when we had so much white\nflight. African Americans in Jefferson County,\nKentucky, the largest percent go to the worst performing\nschools. The lowest percent go to the better performing\nschools. That can't be constitutional. That can't be\ndiscriminatory, and that can't be an exemption under the\nFourteenth Amendment and Equal Protection.\nI'd like to save a little bit, the remainder\nof my time, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nGeneral Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nPetitioner's son was denied the opportunity\nto transfer from Young Elementary School to Bloom\nElementary School solely on the basis of his race.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Clement, can I ask\nyou a question that's prompted really by your argument\nin the last case. I wonder about the purity of the\nmotive that's required. Supposing you had a city like\nChicago with a neighborhood school system and in one\nneighborhood there was a school that was 100 percent\nAfrican American, both student body and faculty, and up\non the North Side there's a school that's 100 percent\nwhite, both students and faculty. Would it be\npermissible for the school board to decide that it would\nbe healthy for both schools to have five African\nAmerican schools in the North Side school and five white\nteachers in the South Side school?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Stevens --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And then order that, hire\nteachers to do that?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think I'd have to -- I\nmean, I think it would depend --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The only purpose is racial\nintegration.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think if you build into\nthe hypo that the only purpose was race and then it was\ndone in a way that made it express that the teachers\nwere going to be moved, that you were basically going to\nhave five and five, you were going to have a quota at\nthe two schools on the basis of race, I would say that\nthat would be unconstitutional.\nI would think, though, that there are many\nways you can accomplish similar objectives without\nmaking it so explicit. And I do think that in this\ncontext, I mean, there is an independent constitutional\nvalue in not having these kind of express racial\nclassifications drawn.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand, and I'm just\nwondering whether in your view that independent value\ncould ever be trumped by the obvious countervailing\nvalue of having some African Americans see some white\nteachers and vice versa?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Oh, but I think that's the\npoint, which is that is an important objective, but I\nhave little doubt that that can be accomplished without\nthe kind of five by five quotas.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You have doubt -- you have\nlittle doubt. Are you an educational expert? I mean,\nthe -- it seems to me from what I read, that there is a\nterrible problem in the country. The problem is that\nthere are lots and lots of school districts that are\nbecoming more and more segregated in fact, and that\nschool boards all over are struggling with this problem.\nAnd if they knew an easy way, they'd do it.\nSo I don't know whether this is exactly the\nonly way to do it or not. I do know courts are not very\ngood at figuring that out. And I guess that's why the\nCourt previously has said it is primarily up to the\nschool district. What's your response?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Whatever it takes.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Breyer, if I could\nbe clear, though, what I was saying in response to\nJustice Stevens' question was really focused not on the\nbroader problem, but specifically with respect to\nfaculties. And I think that one is a little easier in\nthe sense that I don't know of any school districts that\nhave tried to maintain the kind of express quotas in\nteaching that he was indicating. I'm not here to tell\nyou that this problem is simple to solve. I'm here to\ntell you, though, that I think the Constitution provides\nan answer.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Just say some. We want\nto -- we're going to make a decision there will be some\nwhite teachers and some African-American teachers in the\nother. And we're going to do it no matter -- if the\nConstitution permits it. And that's our only motive.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, let\nme tell you what I certainly think they could do, which\nis to say, look, you know, we don't have any balance in\nthese two faculties. What we're going to do is we're\ngoing to mix some of them up, we're going to do it in a\nway that looks at a variety of factors, including who is\ngood with young kids, who is good with older kids.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: My example is 100 percent\nmotive to avoid 100 percent segregation.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And I think if what they\nend up doing at the end is not only a hundred percent\nmotive, but a racial classification, then I think runs\nafoul of the Constitution.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Just some, any without\nviolating the Constitution.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Just to be clear, our\nanswer to the hypothetical a hundred percent motivation,\nno racial classification, is that it is still okay.\nNow, some members of the Court may disagree with us on\nthat. But what I would say is it probably doesn't have\nthat great an import in practice, because although it is\neasy to come up with the hypothetical that race is the\nabsolute and sole motivating factor, I think in this\ncontext in particular, I mean, nobody -- you know,\nnobody is trying to do this solely for a race-based\nmotive. In this context, they also have an educational\ngoal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General Clement, do\nyou know how Joshua would have been assigned prior to\nthe establishment of unitary status in this case?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: He would clearly have been\nassigned to one school, and one set of schools on the\nbasis of his race.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't know\nwhether that would have been the magnet or the so-called\nresides school or somewhere else?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, I guess I don't. And\nmaybe I'm missing something. But I think that -- you\nknow, the dual school system predated the court ordered\ndecree, which is part of where we have gotten to with\nresides schools and the like. If I can come back to the\nfacts of this case, I think it's important to recognize\nthat he was denied transfer to Bloom, even though there\nwere empty seats available at Bloom school.\nSo if he had been an African-American, he\nwould have been allowed to transfer to Bloom. Instead,\nhe was prevented. And there was an empty seat sitting\nthere in that school. And that's why I think this case\ndoes prevent a very stark racial quota.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you this, and I\nthink this applies to the case we have got, as well as\nto Justice Stevens' hypothetical. You said in\nJustice Stevens' -- in answer to Justice Stevens'\nhypothetical, that they could achieve a result,\nlegitimately achieve a result of racial mixture within\nthe respective faculties of these schools if they took\nother things in addition to race into consideration.\nYou mentioned ability as teachers and so on.\nBut at the end of the day, the object of\ndoing this, which Justice Stevens' hypo assumed, and I\nthink the object of doing it which your answer assumed,\nwas the achievement of racial mixture in the faculties.\nMy question is: Why do thy have to hide the\nball by saying, oh, we're going to consider these other\nthings, ability to teach, educational credits, whatever\nyou could come up with when at the beginning and at the\nend, the objective is to achieve a racial mix?\nWhy can't they do that candidly and employ a\ncriterion that candidly addresses that objective?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter,\nthere are several responses. One is that the\nConstitution puts a particular premium on avoiding\nexpress racial classifications.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And it has developed that\nconcern in cases in which the obvious use of race was to\nhurt or to stigmatize. Here, there is stigmatization\ngoing on as between black and white, when we say there\nis a value in mixing them up.\nTherefore, why should that same concern\nabout referring to race at all be applied in this case.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, you\nmay have developed that jurisprudence in cases where it\nwas clear there was stigma going on, but you have\nextended it in Croson and in Adarand across the board.\nAnd I have to say --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We have extended it in\ncases in which benefits were being denied. In\nJustice Stevens' hypothetical, and so far as I know in\nthe kindergarten system in these cases, no educational\nbenefit was being denied.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Nothing was being rationed.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think choices were\nbeing denied. And I think you made the distinction\nearlier between an educational -- guarantee of some\neducational opportunity and a choice. But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that is simply another\nway -- when you say it is the choice that's being\ndenied, and that has to be the focus of the analysis,\nthat is simply another way of saying you may never use\nthe means of race-conscious distribution to achieve the\neducational objective. You're saying the same thing in\na different way.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That may be,\nJustice Souter. But what I guess I would say is the\nlogic of your argument would certainly require\nreconsideration of the Gratz case. And this Court in\nthat context thought that individualized consideration\neven if it was going to be very difficult in the context\nof the University of Michigan's 25,000 admissions to the\nundergraduate program, this Court said individualized\nconsideration was part of the constitutional guarantee.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In Gratz, the\ncharacteristics of individuals that could be considered\nwere arguably relevant to a distribution decision.\nHere, the sole point is not to achieve a quota by\nrelaxing other standards. The whole point is to achieve\na value which comes from mixing the races, from\ndistribution.\nAnd, therefore, why is it appropriate to\nlook to other things as opposed to looking at that\ncandidly, if that is a legitimate objective?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Because I think,\nJustice Souter, if you think it is an important value to\nhave a degree of integration in the schools, well, I\nthink you can take race neutral means that will get you\na degree of integration in the schools. What I think is\ntroubling, and what happens in cases like this --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you may use those race\nneutral means only for the purpose of achieving that\nmixture. I take it that's the assumption of your\nanswer.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The objective is fine. The\nimportant thing is simply to hide the ball.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But if you decide that\ncandor is an affirmative good in the use -- in the race\narea, I think what you get is necessarily what you have\nhere, which is strict racial bands. 50, 15 percent.\nThat's not a degree of integration. It is a clear\neffort to try to get the individual schools to mimic the\noverall demographics --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why is -- I'm trying to\nfind out -- I understand what you think of Gratz. We\ncan agree or disagree about that. But the overall view\nof the Constitution, that interpretation that you have\nin your mind, if it really forbids it, no use of race, I\nmean, basically -- all right? Think -- go back to\nCooper versus Aaron. Go back to the case where this\nCourt with paratroopers had to use tremendous means to\nget those children into the school. That's because the\nsociety was divided.\nHere we have a society, black and white, who\nelect school board members who together have voted to\nhave this form of integration. Why, given that change\nin society -- which is a good one -- what -- how can the\nConstitution be interpreted in a way that would require\nus, the judges, to go in and make them take the black\nchildren out of the school?\nSee, my objection to your approach to the\nConstitution is primarily a practical one.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I understand that,\nJustice Breyer. But I think the answer to that is that\nthe lesson of history in this area is that racial\nclassifications are not ones where we should just let\nlocal school board officials do what they think is\nright.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are you prepared to just\nsay, all right, they can do it some, just be careful\nabout it? How far will you go with that?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think everybody concedes\nthat strict scrutiny is going to apply here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you're\nsaying we'll do it some, just be careful about it?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, we would -- you know,\nI think we would have to look at the details of the\nplan. That's what narrow tailoring meant. And I think\nthat's what -- you know, Justice Kennedy made the point\nin his opinion in Grutter that the problem with\napproving the first blunderbuss opportunity that you see\nto use race in a context is that then you deprive the\ncourts of any role trying to refine matters, and seeing,\nmaybe the racial situation would be narrowly tailored,\nbut it is sure not these 50-15 bands.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Judge Kozinski thought the\nreal problem here was we should not deify strict\nscrutiny. That's what's caused all the problems.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And Justice Stevens, he\nprobably could have cited two of your opinions for that\nproposition. But you know, the rest of us do have to\nwork with --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It is often true that\nsometimes doctrines do have unintended consequences when\nyou push the logic of extremes. There is no doubt about\nthat.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: There's no doubt about\nthat, but the rest of us do have to work with this\nCourt's precedents --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And they also have\nunintended consequences when this Court ignores them.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely. And it also\nhas some real world consequences when we decides we're\nnot going to apply the normal scrutiny we would to\nracial classifications just because we've made some -- I\ndon't know based on what judgment that in this case, it\nis benign, so we can trust the local school officials.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it isn't that we've\nmade a judgment, the local school board has made a\njudgment which has a lot of experience under both\nsystems.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: There's a lot of\nexperience in Brown, too, and those were local school\nboards, too. And I think the lesson is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do we know the race of the\nschool board here? I mean, that was not -- how do we\nknow these are benign school boards? Is it stipulated\nthat they are benign school boards?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I missed that in the joint\nstipulation, Justice Scalia. I would like to say one --\nif I could make one point here, which is, I really do\nthink that it's worth looking at how this operates in\npractice. And the fact that it leaves seats effectively\nfallow in schools. Because that really marks it as a\nquota. And it's interesting, when that same district\ncourt judge --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that how it worked\nunder the plan that was forced on the school district?\nI thought it was roughly the same plan?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It was, Justice Ginsburg.\nBut I think there's a difference when you move past\nunitary status. It's interesting. In the very case\nwhere the court, Hampton II, where the same district\ncourt found unitary status, he then because the Equal\nProtection Clause was not shielded by the decree, had to\napply it to the use of these same racial bands in the\ncontext of magnet schools.\nAnd what did this same district court judge\nfind there? He found they operated, quote, as a hard\nracial quota. Because the effect of these 50-15 bands\nwas to keep hundreds of seats at Central High School, a\npopular magnet school empty, and away from\nAfrican-American students because the district wanted to\nmaintain its predetermined racial balance.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I right in thinking\nthat the government in 2000 opposed terminating this --\nthe compulsory plan?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: You mean the United States\ngovernment?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Or the school board? They\nactually both opposed, which is something -- shows you\nsomething of the anomalies that you can get from this\nsituation, which is the school board wanting to continue\nits practice of using these racial guidelines actually\nopposed the finding of unitary status. I would say,\nthough --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought it was the\nUnited States?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Yeah, we had some specific\nobjections in which we thought that two of the green\nfactors were not satisfied. That argument was rejected\nby the district court.\nIf I can go back to the judge's finding\nabout the magnet schools, what is so interesting is the\nsame judge finds the same guidelines to be a hard racial\nquota as to the magnet schools, but not as to the\nneighborhood schools. Why does he make that\ndistinction? Because he finds that the neighborhood\nschools are basically equal, and therefore, denying a\nstudent an opportunity to attend to one rather than\nanother was not an injury of constitutional magnitude.\nBut I would have thought it is far too late\nin the day, and the Chief Justice suggested this as\nwell, to say that just because two schools are basically\nequal, you can deny a student the right to attend one,\nand assigns one and only one based on his race. Thank\nyou.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nGeneral Clement.\nMr. Mellen?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS J. MELLEN, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. MELLEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case presents a story of a community\nthat once maintained racially segregated schools, that\ndesegregated those schools only when a court ordered it,\nand that today maintains racially integrated schools\nwith broad community support.\nThis case presents a story of a board of\neducation that replaced a desegregation decree with a\nstudent assignment plan that works, that stopped the\nwhite flight that was the result of the desegregation\ndecree and has stabilized enrollment in our public\nschools. This case presents a success story and it's a\nsuccess that was achieved in compliance with this\nCourt's strict scrutiny test.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does this case present the\nstory where the meaning of Brown versus Board of\nEducation is you can never take race out of politics?\nMR. MELLEN: I think, Your Honor, that Brown\nis very much distinguishable. In Brown, the Topeka\nboard maintained two systems of schools. And admission\nto those schools, admission, not assignment, was based\nsolely on race. That stigmatized the black children.\nIt sent the message that the white race was dominant and\nsuperior and that the black race was inferior. That\ncaused great harm to those black students and this Court\nproperly remediated it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And this doesn't? I mean,\nthis which is somehow based on the notion that a school\nthat is predominantly black or overwhelmingly black\ncannot be as good as a school that is predominantly\nwhite or overwhelmingly white? That doesn't send any\nmessage?\nMR. MELLEN: The plan, Your Honor, is not\nbased solely on that supposition. This plan is based on\nthe supposition that a school that is racially\nidentifiable, and that would include a white racially\nidentifiable school, does not provide to the students in\nthat school the compelling benefits that our board\nbelieves are presented by racial integration.\nThe compelling benefits, some of which are\nthe benefits that this Court identified in Grutter, from\nthe racial diversity that was a byproduct --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're talking about white\nflight, you're not talking about black flight. And\nwhat's going on here is makes sure that there are a\ncertain number of white students or as high a proportion\nas you can get. In schools that would be otherwise be\noverwhelmingly black. And it seems to me if you are\nappealing to stigmatization, that -- that is based on an\nassumption that it seems to me is stigmatizing.\nMR. MELLEN: This plan -- and the Federal\ncourts have held for years school districts do have an\ninterest in avoiding white flight. And As I said, this\nplan has prevented -- has stopped white flight and has\nstabilized enrollment in our schools.\nBut this -- this plan was adopted, Your\nHonor, for the purpose of providing the compelling\nbenefits of racial integration, some of which this Court\nidentified in Grutter, some of which the District Court\nfound were not present in the University of Michigan Law\nSchool case, but are present in an elementary and\nsecondary system of schools. For example, the District\nCourt found that this plan makes our public schools more\ncompetitive and attractive and results in broader\ncommunity support for those schools.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I, I think that's probably\ntrue. I think it is also probably true that the people\nin your community and the people on your school board\nare acting in the utmost good faith. And that what they\nhave done is going to help the education of many\nstudents.\nThe question is whether or not we can say\nthat an insincere school board, people that want to play\nthe race card, who want to play the race trip, the --\nthe race chip, that want a system in which they can use\nrace for political advantage, can do this based on the\ncolor of the individual child's skin. That's what's\ninvolved here.\nMR. MELLEN: I don't think that's what is\ninvolved in this case, Your Honor, because the District\nCourt found that the board's motives were indeed\nlegitimate and that there was no basis --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm conceding that. The\nConstitution assumes that this might not always be the\ncase. Are we going to look at the sincerity of the\nschool boards, school by school board, school board\nmember by school board member?\nMR. MELLEN: I don't think that would be\nproper for the courts to do that, Your Honor, but the\nother issue that's presented by these cases is whether\nthe use of race is narrowly tailored. And the District\nCourt found in this case that it was, was for a variety\nof reasons. So I think that this case does not, Your\nHonor, present the hypothetical that you suggested and\nin other cases with different factors --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it, but it presents\nthe principle that this Court is confronted with. If we\nfor the first time say that a system that has achieved\nunitary status. So that the courts no longer have the\nauthority or the need to supervise them, can then turn\naround and use individual skin color as a basis for\nassignment, we've never said that. And that takes us on\na very perilous course.\nMR. MELLEN: You've never said it, Your\nHonor and the question has never been presented. A\nsimilar question was presented in the University of\nMichigan Law School case. And this Court held the use\nof a racial classification to satisfy a compelling\ninterest and in a narrowly tailored manner --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In the university cases\nthis Court ran as far away as it could from using racial\nquotas. It talked about the fact that there was an\nindividualized assessment. At, at issue was a\nuniversity student who could understand the reasons for\nbeing rejected on, on the grounds of race, race being\none criteria. That isn't this case.\nMR. MELLEN: That's not this case, Your\nHonor, because our board asserts a different compelling\ninterest. The compelling interest asserted by the\nMichigan Law School was viewpoint diversity. A\ndifferent kind of -- it's a byproduct of that.\nThis Court asserts an interest in -- this\nboard, I'm sorry, asserts an interest in racial\nintegration and we believe that there are compelling\nbenefits from racial integration and that this board\nprovides them to all students, both black and white.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Once again, once again,\none of the rationales for the law school cases was a\nFirst Amendment rationale. And you, and I think\nproperly so, say that this is, this is not your\ninterest. I agree with you. But that means that that\ncase is completely inapplicable to help you.\nMR. MELLEN: I don't think it's completely\ninapplicable, Your Honor, because this case presents the\nsame basic doctrinal question that was presented in\nGrutter, whether a Government agency can use race as a\nclassification with a compelling interest with narrow\ntailoring. This Court in Grutter identified several\nbenefits of racial diversity. Some of those benefits\nare presented in the elementary and secondary school\ncontext. And we have additional benefits that are\npresented by racial integration.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Mellen, here is a\nquestion I should have asked friends on the other side.\nBut I think it is raised by Justice Kennedy's question,\nso let me put it out.\nAre there circumstances under which there is\nreason to suspect the motivation of school districts\nwhen they come up with a plan in effect to require a\nmixing of the races in the schools that is more or less\ntailored to the relative percentages in the communities?\nIs -- are there circumstances in which that would be\ndone for malign as opposed to benign purposes?\nMR. MELLEN: I think it could be, Your\nHonor. And this Court has said --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And what -- give me some,\nor give me or an example.\nMR. MELLEN: Your Honor, I'm not sure I can\nthink of one because I come from a community with a long\nhistory of, of not doing that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Easy. Easy. Take a school\ndistrict that is overwhelmingly minority. And --\noverwhelmingly black, if you will. And a school board\nthat reflects that. And in which by reason of\nresidential patterns, the white schools, despite the\nsame expenditure of money, same level of teaching and\neverything else, the white schools are better schools.\nAnd the school board could decide we would\nlike our race to get into those better white schools.\nNot because we want mixing. We just want, want them to\nget into those schools.\nWouldn't that be a situation in which the\nboard could then come up with a -- you know, these good\nschools ought to have 80 percent blacks in them? I\nwould not consider that a benign objective.\nMR. MELLEN: There might be, Your Honor,\nunder those circumstances a compelling interest in doing\nthat. The question would be whether it is narrowly\ntailored. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think there's a\ncompelling interest in doing it at all. They're doing\nit for a racially selfish reason. They want their\nconstituency, they want the 80 percent of black\nstudents, to be in the better schools. You consider\nthat a valid interest, and a non-racial interest?\nMR. MELLEN: No. No, Your Honor. Of course\nwith that explanation, I do not.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you think the school\nboard in that case would use the clumsy means of racial\nintegrational mixing as opposed simply to devoting more\nmoney to the black schools?\nMR. MELLEN: I would certainly think, Your\nHonor, that a wise school board would use other methods\nto achieve that result. Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I would think so, too.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why did you say -- in\ntruth, maybe I missed it. In your response to\nJustice Kennedy, I think you said, when he asked, that\nthis Court has never said that the explicit use of race\nby a K through 12 school board was constitutional, and I\nthought the Court had explicitly said that in Swann.\nMR. MELLEN: I, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought that, that\nJustice Powell explicitly said it. I that Chief Justice\nRehnquist had explicitly said it. I thought if you went\nback in sense to the slaughterhouse cases, you'll find\nin 1872, this Court thought that the primary objective,\nthe primary objective of that Fourteenth Amendment was\nto take people who had been formerly slaves and to bring\nthem into this society, and that all of phrases of that\namendment should be interpreted with that objective in\nmind. I mean, it didn't say that explicitly there, but\nit seems explicitly and implicitly this Court has said\nthat.\nMR. MELLEN: Well, I agree, Justice Breyer.\nAnd I misspoke, I used one word incorrectly. I said --\nI should have said this Court has not held. I agree\nwith General Clement that Swann was dictum, but a very\nstrong dictum. And we do think it applies here.\nDictum.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think -- I think\nwe were communicating. Swann was a case where there was\nde jure discrimination. Bakke was a university case.\nThis is a different case.\nMR. MELLEN: It is indeed a different case,\nYour Honor. We do not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's, and it's a\ntroubling case.\nMR. MELLEN: We do not contend, Your Honor,\nthat the purpose of this plan is to remediate past\ndiscrimination against black students. This plan is\nintended to provide benefits to both black and white\nstudents.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your arguments do\nnot depend in any way on the prior de jure segregation?\nMR. MELLEN: They do not, Your Honor. We\nwould agree that we stand on the same footing as the\nSeattle district, as a unitary district this case needs\nto be measured against whether a board has a compelling\ninterest and -- or board feels quite strongly that there\nis compelling interest for the racial classification\nthat's employed in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about the other part?\nBecause I think the Solicitor General -- I hope, I don't\nwant to put words in his mouth -- but I think he agrees\nthat Brown held out the promise of an equal education,\nthat the country worked for 35 or 40 years to try to get\na degree of integration, and that maintaining it is\nimportant. I think the Government agrees with that.\nThey think this case goes too far. And in that I think\nhe's referring to narrow tailoring. It isn't narrowly\ntailored enough. So I would appreciate knowing why you\nthink it is.\nMR. MELLEN: We think it is, Your Honor, for\nthe very reasons that the District Court held it is.\nThe District Court addressed each of these points\nregarding narrow tailoring which this Court identified\nin Grutter, looked at them very carefully and concluded\nthat it is narrowly tailored. One of that issues that's\nalready been discussed this morning is individual\nconsideration. We agree with the position that the\nCircuit Court took in the Ninth Circuit that in a\nsituation in which the compelling interest is racial\nintegration, that it makes no sense to take into account\nother background characteristics of students other than\ntheir race.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If it were to become\nrelevant, would this record show -- this is the school\ndistrict -- and this would be in the regime of the\nCourt-ordered desegregation plan, because you are just\nrecently emerged from that -- that the school district\nhas tried means other than race conscious, of race\nclassification in order to obtain the diversity benefits\nyou seek?\nMR. MELLEN: The school district has, Your\nHonor. In fact this plan uses those --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And were those magnet\nschools? And could you tell me about that?\nMR. MELLEN: Magnet schools, Your Honor.\nAnd with respect to history, Your Honor, it is somewhat\ncomplex, because although the Court ruled in the Hampton\ncase in 2000 that the degree was dissolved then, the\nboard honestly felt beginning in 1981 that the decree\nhad been dissolved. And so the board in 1984, 1991,\n1996 made what it thought were voluntary modifications\nto the plan.\nBeginning in the late 1980s, the board began\nto introduce more choice into the system including\nmagnet schools, magnet programs. The board uses race\nneutral lotteries to determine enrollment in some\nschools. But the board feels and it feels very strongly\nbased on conversations that board members and staff\npeople have had with other school districts that have\ntried race-neutral measures including Charlotte\nMecklenburg, Wake county and San Francisco -- that\nrace-neutral measures alone will not do the job and the\nexperience in those districts indicates that they will\nnot do the job.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But your starting place\nwas the plan that was compulsory, that was forced on the\nschool district in 1975? That is basically the same\nkind of plan?\nMR. MELLEN: Well, Your Honor, I would say\nthat the starting point was that plan. The board has\nmodified it considerably since then to make assignments\nmore stable and predictable, to make the use of race\nmore narrowly tailored. It is in concept the same plan,\nbecause it has some of the features, but the board has\nadded many features that that plan did not have.\nThe 1975 desegregation decree was really\nquite a blunt instrument and that's why it was so\ncontroversial in the community. That's why there was\nmassive white flight. This plan, this board has very\nwisely modified that plan to make it much more\nacceptable to the community so that we stopped the white\nflight. We stabilized our enrollment. We have a\ncommunity now that very broadly, the public opinion\nsurveys show, that supports racial integration whereas\nin 1975, they were opposed to it, sometimes violently.\nThis is as I said at the outset a success\nstory.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What would happen if you\ncouldn't use this system?\nMR. MELLEN: And that would depend, Your\nHonor, on what this Court said we could not use.\nWe do know that four of our schools, magnet\nschools are now not subject to racial guidelines because\nof the District Court's decision in the Hampton 2 case.\nOne of those schools, Central High School, is far\noutside the racial guidelines. It has a black\nenrollment of about 83 percent. At two of those other\nmagnet schools black enrollment has declined. It's\ndeclined by about by about a third in two of those\nschools. And that is only in the space of a few years.\nOur school board staff has conducted some\nhypothetical scenarios as to what would happen without\nthe racial guidelines. Some hypothetical scenarios\ninvolve choice. Some involve purely neighborhood\nschools. All of those scenarios show substantial\nresegregation, particularly in elementary schools.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do any of those study the\npossibilities of the system in which you elect to go\ninto a system where race counts?\nMR. MELLEN: Some of those scenarios, Your\nHonor, did have some degree of choice.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are they written out\nanywhere we can see them? Or are there articles on\nthis?\nMR. MELLEN: They are not in the record in\nthis case, Your Honor. They were in the record in the\nHampton case, so if you read the Hampton 2 opinion you\nwill see that the district court included a lengthy\nfootnote in which he basically summarized those\nscenarios.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you say your plan has\nthe overwhelming support of the community, does\n\"community\" mean those parent who have children in\nthe schools?\nMR. MELLEN: Some of the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me that ought\nto be the really -- the people who are the objects of\nthis experiment. Do they think it's doing --\nMR. MELLEN: They do indeed, Your Honor.\nThose surveys were surveys by the University of Kentucky\nResearch Center of parents.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And did the parents'\nsatisfaction with it break out along racial lines? Or\nwas it evenly divided?\nMR. MELLEN: It was fairly evenly divided,\nYour Honor. One of our expert witnesses said that --\nwell, both of them said that they were quite surprised\nthat the findings were so positive. One of the expert\nwitnesses said that unquestionably this is a community\nthat values diversity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that?\nMR. MELLEN: That's the testimony of Edward\nKiefer, Your Honor, from the university of Kentucky. He\nwas responsible for the survey --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And he's talking about the\nparents of students in the school?\nMR. MELLEN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nThat's -- there are some other surveys, I believe, that\ninclude the entire community. But I think you'll see in\nthe record some that are parents only.\nI would like, Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg,\nto respond very briefly to some of the facts concerning\nJoshua, because you asked about that. There is nothing\nin the record that says that Ms. Meredith moved into the\ndistrict in Florida just when she showed up at\nBreckenridge-Franklin. With respect to her appeal, in\nfact the litigation had not commenced when she would\nhave had an opportunity to file an appeal. The\nstipulation of facts says that she did not apply for\nJoshua for the first grade.\nNow, Ms. Bloom -- excuse me. Ms. Meredith\n-- and this is not in the record because it took place\nafter the record was closed -- but Ms. Meredith\nreapplied for a transfer after Joshua finished the first\ngrade. That transfer was initially denied. She\nappealed. The transfer was granted and Joshua does now\nattend Bloom. I think that's relevant because the\nSolicitor General made an argument in his brief that\nthis plan allows the student to be trapped in a school.\nWe would certainly not agree that an assignment to any\none of our fine schools could be a trap. But in any\nevent, students can reapply each year and that has\nhappened. It happened here in the case of Joshua --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me, how is\nrace used? Do the administrators have discretion in the\nweight they will give to it on a case by case basis?\nMR. MELLEN: I don't think exactly, Your\nHonor. Race is used, as the district court found,\nreally as the final factor, a tipping factor. Residence\ncomes into play. Choice comes into play. Lotteries in\nsome schools come into play.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure how to ask\nthe question: Is it used fairly evenly across the board\nwhen it is the tiebreaker?\nMR. MELLEN: We don't used the word\n\"tiebreaker,\" Your Honor. The record indicates --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: To tip the tipping point,\nwhatever.\nMR. MELLEN: The record indicates that race\nwould be the dispositive factor in no more than 2 to 3\npercent of the choice applications.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That means -- that leads\nto the question of why do they need it?\nMR. MELLEN: I think they need it, Your\nHonor, because it sets a boundary. It defines what\nracial integration means. If staff had come to this\nboard with a plan that said, our goal is racial\nintegration --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So it's symbolic that race\ncounts?\nMR. MELLEN: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nI think it simply sets the outer limits within which our\nprocess of choice and other methods of assignment works.\nWithout that boundary, it could be transgressed one\nstudent at a time.\nThe guidelines I think are very much like\nthe little boy in the Dutch story who put his finger in\nthe dike because a few drops of water were coming out.\nHe knew it would become a flood eventually if he didn't\ndo that. We think that is exactly the case here, that\nwithout these guidelines one student at a time could\ntransgress them and ultimately we would have a\nresegregated school system.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Mellen, I've been\nlooking at Dr. Kiefer's testimony. Is this what you're\nreferring to: \"There was remarkable agreement among\nevery group in Jefferson County Public Schools about how\ndesirable having diversity in the schools was\"?\nMR. MELLEN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I have no double about\nthat. I mean, if you're going to ask anybody, you know,\ndo you prefer integrated schools or would you prefer\nlily-white schools, nobody is going to say give me a\nlily-white school. Of course nobody's going to say\nthat.\nI was asking whether the parents whose kids\ncan't go to the schools they want to go to, including\nthe neighborhood schools, do they like this particular\nsystem of achieving the racial diversity? Is there any\ntestimony about that?\nMR. MELLEN: The great majority do, Your\nHonor. And I think if you look at the University of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Black and white alike?\nMR. MELLEN: Black and white alike, in large\nnumbers. No plan, Your Honor, can be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do we know that?\nMR. MELLEN: Again, Your Honor, the\nUniversity of Kentucky survey, which is in the record --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is in the record?\nMR. MELLEN: -- broke it down by race among\nparents. It asked whether guidelines were proper. It\nasked whether assignment on socioeconomic status would\nbe preferred. There are a lot of questions in that\nsurvey and I think you might find --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not in your joint\nappendix here?\nMR. MELLEN: It's not in the joint appendix.\nIt's an exhibit, I believe, to the stipulation of facts,\nYour Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There were questions\nearlier about the status of the particular plaintiff.\nYou're not challenging standing or raising mootness, are\nyou?\nMR. MELLEN: No, we're not, Your Honor.\nWe're not challenging standing. We're simply saying\nthat Ms. Meredith did not suffer undue harm within the\nmeaning of this Court's decisions and that parents as a\nwhole and students as a whole do not suffer undue harm.\nThere have questions in the first case about\nan end point. I might address that briefly. We believe\nthat the use of race in this plan is self-limiting in\nseveral respects. If racially segregated housing in\nJefferson County continues to decline, which it has\nsomewhat since the 1970s, and the board has reason to\nbelieve that the presence of racially integrated schools\nduring that period contributed to that -- there are\nseveral amicus briefs that were filed in this case that\nset forth research that supports that conclusion. If\nracially segregated housing continues to decline and if\nthis plan meets its purpose of diminishing racial\nstereotypes and promoting better cross-racial\nunderstanding throughout the community, we can foresee a\ntime when this board will not see a reason to use this\nplan or may modify it further to make it even less\nrestrictive.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In a time horizon\nlonger or shorter than the 25-year time horizon that was\ndiscussed in Grutter?\nMR. MELLEN: I can't predict the future,\nYour Honor. I can say it could be shorter for another\nreason. That is that this plan is inherently subject to\ndemocratic review by elected school board and by the\nvoters. It could end sooner than that if the board and\nthe voters change their minds. I can't predict whether\nit might end longer than that. I can only say that this\nboard has a long history of modifying the plan. As I\nsaid, they modified it in 1984, 1991, 1996, 2001. It's\nin the very nature of how a board of education works\nthat they continue to tinker with things.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If the attitude is the\none that this board has taken, then the same reasons\nwould exist for the plan as long as there is segregation\nin housing.\nMR. MELLEN: I wouldn't limit that, limit it\nto that, Your Honor. I think that an important factor\nare racial attitudes in the community. I think that\nthis board feels that the plan does serve to ameliorate\nracial stereotypes, promote cross-racial understanding.\nOur community still has a long way to go in that\nrespect. We do have some racial issues in Jefferson\nCounty. But we believe this plan helps them. And in\nthe future a board may look at our community, may look\nat how racial relations work in our community, and may\nwell decide that, even though housing is still somewhat\nsegregated, we can do without this plan or again we can\nmodify it to make it less restrictive, which in fact the\nhistory of this plan shows that this board has done.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what would this board\nhave to have in order for it not to be temporally\nlimited in your opinion? Any plan can be changed in the\nfuture. So why does the fact that this can be changed\nin the future make it a plan that has a temporal\nlimitation?\nMR. MELLEN: Well, Your Honor, it does not\nhave fixed temporal limitation of 25 years or 10 years.\nAs I said, that's not how school boards operate. But it\nis inherently subject to review on a temporal basis\nbecause each time we have a school board election the\nplan potentially is in play, and it could be modified at\nany time in that sense.\nI see that my time is almost up. If there\nare no further --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just. Was there a\npetition for a rehearing en banc in this case?\nMR. MELLEN: There was, Your Honor, in the\nSixth Circuit, and it was denied.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Were there any votes in\nfavor of the en banc rehearing?\nMR. MELLEN: Your Honor, as I recall the\nSixth Circuit's order, it said that no judge asked for a\nrehearing en banc.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: THE COURT: Thank\nyou, Mr. Mellen.\nMr. Gordon, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TEDDY B. GORDON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GORDON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nFirst of all, to respond to one of the\nquestions that was asked, it's very important that it is\nequally consistent in the 1992 plan to effectuate or to\nprevent white flight that the plan itself was changed to\nsubjugate African American kids to the worse performing\nschools. If you find that equally consistent, then you\nhave a question of whether or not illegitimate notions\nof racial inferiority applied or racial politics applied\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me. I didn't\nunderstand it.\nMR. GORDON: Well, in the '92 plan and from\nthat point on, which I showed, which was held in the\nHampton plan, in the Hampton case -- in other words, in\nthe Hampton case I proved, or the facts proved or the\nplaintiff proved, that African American kids were denied\nentrance into the better schools solely because of race.\nWithin the vacuum of that case, there was\nalso proof that showed the largest percent of African\nAmerican kids were sent or denigrated or subjugated to\nthe worse performing schools rather than the best\nperforming schools. That becomes the question of racial\npolitics and racial animus, and that's what the '92 plan\ndid. And what it did to attract -- or prevent white\nflight, was have less African American kids go to the\nbetter performing schools on the entire K through 12\nsetting.\nThat can't be what this Court wants to carve\nout as an exemption to the Equal Protection Clause. The\nEqual Protection Clause, that's on neutral parchment\nwith black ink. There's no percents. There's no box to\ncheck. We can't have this in our school system, to have\nanother 25 or 30 years in our school system, which will\nperpetuate racial isolationism because it does nothing\nto stop the achievement gap. There were race-neutral\nalternative tracks.\nAll I can say is that, may this day be the\nembryonic beginning of Dr. King's dream, as paraphrased,\nthat all children are now judged by the content of their\ncharacter and their education, not by the color of their\nskin.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
