        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument first today in Case 08-472, Salazar v. Buono.\nGeneral Kagan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELENA KAGAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nGENERAL KAGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe Establishment Clause does not prohibit\nthe sensible action Congress took in enacting Section\n8121 and thereby divesting the Federal Government of the\nproperty at issue in this case.\nThe district court gave Congress two basic\noptions when it found the Sunrise Rock War Memorial\nunconstitutional. First, Congress could accede to\npermanently removing the memorial, ending the dispute,\nbut also doing away with a memorial that for 75 years\nhad commemorated America's fallen soldiers and had\nacquired deep meaning for the veterans in the community.\nOr, second, Congress --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Kagan, just as a\nfactual matter, is there any other national memorial\nthat consists of a solitary cross, just that one symbol\nand no other?\nGENERAL KAGAN: I don't believe that there\nis, Justice Ginsburg. There are national memorials that\nhave some religious content to them. There is, for\nexample, a statue of a Catholic priest holding a very\nlarge cross, but most national memorials are -- are not\nreligious. Some are.\nThe -- the -- you know, I think that it\nwould even be possible, for example, to make a church or\na synagogue a national memorial. If -- if Dr. King's\nchurch were selected as a national memorial because of\n-- in order to honor Dr. King, I think that would be\npermissible. If --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I was just curious\nas a factual matter whether this lone cross, if -- if\nthere was any other memorial like that, and your answer\nis no, but there could be other religiously oriented\nmemorials?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Yes, and there is at least\none religiously oriented memorial that I know of, which\nis a priest holding a cross.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What are the practical\nconsequences of something being designated as a national\nmemorial?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Very little, Justice Alito.\nIn fact, it has no consequences in terms of the\ngovernment's supervision of the land. National\nmemorials can be on private land or on public land. If\nthey are on private land, nothing goes along with the\ndesignation by way of more extensive regulation or\nsupervision by the National Park Service.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the -- is the private\nproperty owner who has this designation free to destroy\nit after it's been designated a national memorial?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. The\nVeterans of Foreign Wars here could in fact take down\nthis memorial once it is transferred to them, if the\nCourt allows that transfer.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could they then\nsubstitute whatever other memorial they chose?\nGENERAL KAGAN: The --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Or would there have to be\nsome government approval?\nGENERAL KAGAN: No, no, no. The\nreversionary clause which is at issue, which is a part\nof the transfer legislation, says that the VFW will have\nto put up a veterans memorial, but the content of that\nveterans memorial is entirely up to the VFW.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it wouldn't\nautomatically require acquire a national memorial\nstatus, would it, when the government hasn't seen it,\nhasn't -- I thought that to get national memorial\nstatus, the government has to approve what you put up.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Yes, that's correct. If the\nVFW took down this memorial and substituted a different\nmemorial, that memorial would not at that point have\nnational memorial status.\nThere is a little bit of a dispute as to\nwhether the -- the VFW could in fact take down the\nmemorial or whether it's designation as a national\nmemorial would prevent them from doing that. I think\nit's quite clear, if you look at the statute, that the\nSection 1369, which is what the Respondents point to,\nwould not prevent the VFW from taking down this\nmemorial, if it so wanted to, because 1369 applies only\nto national memorials which are on public property. If\nthe transfer were to take place, of course, it would not\nbe on public property, or it would not be under the\nsupervision, in any way, of the Federal Government.\nSo --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: General Kagan, before you\ngo -- go on with your argument, you presented it as --\nas though the issue before us is the -- the conveying of\nthe land. But is it?\nWhat this was was simply an affirmation of\nthe prior injunction. The court of appeals said the\nprior injunction had not been mooted by the -- by the\ntransfer of the land. So isn't really the issue whether\nthat -- that prior injunction, when the land did indeed\nbelong to the government, whether that prior injunction\nwas valid?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, there is a question in\nthis case whether the prior injunction was valid and was\nthe display itself a violation of the Establishment\nClause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nGENERAL KAGAN: But the government argued\nbelow that that question had been mooted out because of\nthe passage of the transfer legislation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But didn't the court of\nappeals say no?\nGENERAL KAGAN: The court of appeals did say\nno, but it remands the government --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so what we have\nbefore us is the court of appeals' affirmation of the\nprior injunction, which applied to a cross on public\nland.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, I think what you have\nbefore you, there were of course two stages in this\nlitigation, and the first stage declared the display\nunconstitutional, and then the second stage declared the\ntransfer as well unconstitutional or at least a\nviolation of the prior injunction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, if I -- if I\nthought the display wasn't unconstitutional, the\ntransfer would a fortiori not --\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, that is correct. We\ndo think that the issue before the Court now is the\ncongressional legislation which has been passed, which\nis the transfer legislation, that that has essentially\nchanged the situation on the ground, so that no longer\nis the question whether the display from the -- whether\nthe display by the government would be constitutional,\nbut only whether the government has the ability to\ntransfer this property and -- and to give up all\nsupervision, all control over it.\nSo that the message --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't see why that's the\nissue before us. Look, procedurally this is a little\nboring, but it seems pretty well established in the law.\nI read a case called Toledo Scale and then there are a\nbunch of cases on jurisdiction, which I'm not going to\nname them because I'm sure you looked at them, but\nTravelers Indemnity, et cetera. And it seems to me they\nmake absolutely clear that once a litigant, you and the\nothers, have had an opportunity to raise a matter and\nnow the case is over, done, but for an injunction that\nstays in, all those issues that they previously raised\nor could have raised are gone; that the only question\nleft is whether the government has complied with the\ninjunction.\nSo I read the injunction. The injunction\nsays the government is enjoined from permitting the\ndisplay of the Latin cross, period. Once this law takes\neffect and you follow it, you are violating that\ninjunction. You don't need nine proceedings to see\nthat. You are violating it.\nNow, if you don't like the injunction\nbecause you think the statute has so changed the\ncircumstances there is no need for it, there is a\nremedy. You go back to the district court and you say:\nJudge, change the injunction. But you haven't done\nthat. And therefore, the only question before us is\nwhether the Ninth Circuit is right in saying when you\ncarry the statute into effect, you are violating this\ninjunction, which I think no one could say you aren't.\nNow, now, that -- that's a very technical\nboring issue. I don't know why we heard this issue, but\nI don't see how we could reach any other issue in this\ncase.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Justice Breyer, I think we\nare in perfect compliance with the injunction and have\nbeen since the day it was issued. Now, in fact there\nwere two injunctions issued. As I said, there were two\nstages of this litigation. The first stage ended in an\ninjunction that said do not display the war memorial.\nIn compliance with that injunction, the next day the war\nmemorial was covered. So we were in compliance from\nthe -- from the moment that the decision issued.\nNow then, Respondents went back to the\ndistrict court and asked for additional relief, because\nwhat -- during the first court of appeals hearing,\nCongress had passed this transfer statute. And so the\nRespondents went back and said: In addition to the\ninjunction that you previously gave us, we essentially\nneed a new injunction and that injunction will be to\nstop the transfer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's not what I'm\ntalking about.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the Respondents\nasked to have the injunction enforced. It is typical,\nyou get an injunction -- and I'm glad that the\ngovernment has recognized that that was indeed a final\ndecision because you appealed it to the Ninth Circuit\nunder 1291 as a final decision. Then the question is,\nare you complying with the injunction. One side says,\nthe winner -- who by the way has unquestioned standing\nto enforce the injunction that is now final that that\nparty obtained -- the winner says: Court, please\nenforce the injunction. They are not asking for a new\ninjunction. They say this injunction, as Justice Breyer\njust explained, says, do not permit the cross. The\nparty comes in and says: Here's my injunction; court,\nall I want you to do is enforce it.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Justice Ginsburg, this is\nmuch more than an enforcement action.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We are talking about the\nfirst. We are talking about the first injunction. The\nfirst injunction says that the government may not permit\ndisplay. You've covered it up, so you are not\npermitting display. You are in compliance.\nGENERAL KAGAN: That is correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what the plaintiff here\nsaid is that when you comply with this statute, you will\nnot be in compliance, because you will turn it over to\nthe VFW that will uncover it, so you will have permitted\nit to be displayed. Now, that I can see is an issue\nbefore us. But I don't see any other issue before us.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Justice Breyer, again, the\nRespondents had to go back to the district court in\norder not just to enforce the injunction, which said\ndon't display the statue, but to get additional relief,\nwhich was don't transfer the statue. If the transfer\nhad taken place, it would no longer have been the\ngovernment's property, the government would not have\npermitted or not permitted the display because it wasn't\nthe government's property to permit or not to permit the\ndisplay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me unreasonable\nto read the injunction to say the government shall not\npermit anybody to display a cross on that land no matter\nwho owns the land. I assume the injunctions meant you\nwill not permit the cross to be displayed on this parcel\nof government land.\nGENERAL KAGAN: And the Ninth Circuit\nspecifically said -- when this came to the Ninth\nCircuit, the Ninth Circuit was asked by the Respondents.\nIn order to rule on the transfer legislation, the Ninth\nCircuit specifically said: We are not going to do that;\nthat's a decision for another day, a separate decision.\nBecause of that, the Respondents had to go back to the\ndistrict court and had to get the district court\nessentially to modify the injunction and to provided\nadditional relief.\nNow, there is some question as to whether\nthe standing question here, just the standing question\nis precluded, and our view is that it is not preclude,\nbecause the way the government views this is it's one\nentire litigation in which all issues are open.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know, General\nKagan, any case in which there has been a permanent\ninjunction ordered, final, no more appeals are possible,\nwhere -- and standing was in question, raised,\nlitigated, and decided, and then when the party who won\nthe injunction comes to the court and says, court,\nplease enforce the injunction, that you can say, now we\ncan go back to square one and argue again about\nstanding? I don't see how you can revive what has been\ndetermined by a final judgment.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, either this is one\nlitigation, in which all cases are before the Court, or\nit's too entirely separate litigations, in which case\nthe Court has an obligation to independently consider\nthe standing question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we know it isn't\nthat because, as I think you pointed out, the same\ndocket number. This wasn't a new complaint. This was a\nmotion to enforce the judgment.\nGENERAL KAGAN: It couldn't have been a\nmotion to enforce the judgment because the government\nwas in compliance with the judgment and because the\nNinth Circuit had said that the question that\nrespondents were raising was an entirely separate issue\nfor another day, according to the Ninth Circuit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would suppose -- I\nguess I don't agree with your dichotomy, either it's the\nsame action or it's entirely separate. I would suppose\nit could be some issues carry over and are the same, and\nperhaps standing is one of those. Other issues are\ncompletely new, such as the effect of the legislation,\nwhich couldn't have been before the district court since\nit hadn't been passed.\nBut standing is different. I mean, once\nit's been determined that there is standing and that is\nreflected in a final judgment, then I think the later\naspects are simply whether the person -- once it's\nembodied in a judgment, I think that is the basis for\nstanding and not the earlier questions of whether he\nvisited it enough or planned to visit enough.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, we could\nnot have taken the standing question to this Court in\nthe -- in the procedural posture that the case was at at\nthat point. It would have been really an irresponsible\naction on our part to ask this Court to address the\nstanding issue after the first court of appeals judgment\nwhere -- where we knew that we were going to relitigate\nthe question of the validity of the transfer. We\ncouldn't have come to you, we wouldn't have come to you,\nas the Solicitor General's Office and asked you to\nadjudicate a decision that was as likely as not going to\nbe irrelevant.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't understand -- I\ndon't understand that point at all. If you thought that\nhe didn't have standing to challenge the cross at all\nand that the injunction itself directing you to cover up\nthe cross was wrong, you should have come to the Court.\nIt was a permanent injunction. You were told you have\ninterlocutory appeal rights, you have final judgment\nrights. At any point you could have come and said: The\norder for us to take that flag -- to take that cross off\nthis land was just plain wrong.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I think, Justice Sotomayor,\nyou are right that we could have, but I don't think that\nwe would have used our discretion, in a sense knocking\non this Court's door, the Solicitor General's Office\ndiscretion, in order to ask you to decide a question\nthat was as likely or not going to be completely\nirrelevant depending on what happened with respect to\nthe transfer statute.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But interlocutory appeal\nor finality doesn't matter what you are going to do to\nget away from the injunction. The issue is did you give\nup any rights to challenge any of the issues embodied in\nthat injunction and you haven't answered why not. You\nmay have a right, and you do, to challenge a\nmodification of that injunction. That's what you are\nhere to do, to say the Ninth Circuit erred in modifying\nthe injunction and stopping the transfer. Perfectly\nlegitimate point, because the injunction has been\nchanged. But you can't go back and relitigate whether\nhe had standing to challenge that -- the presence of\nthat cross.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, Justice Sotomayor, I\nappreciate the distinction that you are making between\nthe standing question and the merits question and I\nthink you are exactly right as to that point. But\nwhatever the question as to whether we have given up the\nstanding question, certainly there is no such question\non the merits of this -- of the validity of this\ntransfer. But with respect, I think that the standing\nquestion is -- is not the way you described it. And\nit's partly because we couldn't have come to this Court\nor we wouldn't have come, is a better way to say it. We\nwould have thought that it was not the right kind of\nposition to ask the Court to take certiorari on a\nquestion that basically was very likely, we thought, was\nvery likely to go away.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that -- that's\nbecause -- that's because you assume the act is going to\nbe valid. You could have come here and said: This is\nsuch an important case Congress is taking action, and\ntherefore, you should hear our standing argument to\navoid the necessity of the Legislative Branch having to\ncome in. You could have said that.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, but we didn't, because\nwe did think that Congress had acted appropriately and\nthat the congressional act was valid, and continue to do\nso, continue to think that this --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but the standing\nissue was independently important to the government,\nbecause the government can face this kind of question\nagain, and if you right -- if you were right on the\nstanding point -- I mean, I don't understand why the\ngovernment would not have had a strong incentive to say,\nwe want to get rid of these cases on the standing\nground, we think the Court was wrong on standing.\nBut in any case, you didn't do that, and I\nthink that you started your argument this morning in the\nright place when you said, let's talk about this law.\nCongress said, accepting arguendo that the Court was\nright, here's a law that cures the constitutional\ndefect. And that's where you were -- that's where you\nstarted your argument. Maybe you can pick up with that.\nBut --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But just I want to just get\nthis clear procedurally. I'm sorry. It'll take one\nmore second.\nAs I read this, there is no modification of\nany injunction. What the -- what the Respondent asked\nfor, he said: Judge, either hold that the transfer\nviolates the current injunction, or modify the\ninjunction. Then what the district court did do is he\nsaid the proposed transfer violates the permanent\ninjunction. The permanent injunction is in the, like,\nthe third paragraph of the July 24th order, and it says,\nyou are permanently enjoined from permitting the display\nof the Latin cross. Therefore, he rejected the need to\nmodify it, and held that --\nGENERAL KAGAN: Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- this violates the\ninjunction as written, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed\nthat.\nSo is there any question in this case of\nmodifying? Is there any question other than the one\nthat I think Justice Scalia was taking a good argument\nabout, whether the proposed statute violates the\nJuly 24th injunction? That's what the case is about.\nOr why am I wrong?\nGENERAL KAGAN: You -- you are incorrect,\nJustice Breyer, because in addition to saying this\nviolates the previously given injunction, the district\ncourt said, you are enjoined from transferring this\nproperty in accordance with this statute. And so there\nwas additional relief, additional relief that the Ninth\nCircuit said was additional relief that it wasn't\ndeciding in the first go-round, and that's -- and that\nplaces the question, the merits question of the validity\nof this transfer, directly before the Court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before we get --\nbefore your time expires, we would like to spend a\ncouple of minutes on the merits.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I wonder if you\ncould focus on a particular question. What if the\ngovernment sold simply one square foot, or whatever the\narea that the base of the cross is -- is resting on the\nground? Would your argument be the same?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, there are\ncertainly limits to the way that the government can\ntransfer property, and I would give you a few of them.\nIf -- if it was not a bona fide sale, so that there\nwasn't proper consideration; if -- if there was only\nreligious purpose, so that there was no secular purpose\ninvolved; or if after the sale the property was\nindistinguishable from government property, so that\neverybody naturally thought that this was government\nproperty. In those cases --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why isn't that\n-- why isn't that the case here?\nGENERAL KAGAN: In fact, it's not the case\nhere. And it's not the case for two reasons. First,\nthe preserve is riddled with private inholdings. There\nare 1800 private landowners with -- excuse me, 1,000\nprivate landowners with 1800 plots of land.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But what percentage of the\ntotal area do they represent?\nGENERAL KAGAN: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What percentage of the\ntotal area do they represent?\nGENERAL KAGAN: It's about -- between the\nState and the private inholdings, it's about 10 percent\nof the total area. But they are dotted all over the\nplace. So tomorrow, 1,000 crosses could go up and\nnobody would know whether they were on private land or\non public land. Moreover --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But do you concede there\nwas a violation at the time the case was decided?\nGENERAL KAGAN: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you concede that the\nEstablishment Clause was violated at the time this case\nwas decided?\nGENERAL KAGAN: We do not, Justice Stevens.\nThe government has argued -- argued below that there was\nno violation prior to the transfer statute, and that\nremains the government's position, although, as I said\nto Justice Scalia, we think that that position has been\novertaken by events and that the only question before\nthe Court is the transfer statute.\nI was going to go on to say to the Chief\nJustice that, in addition to the fact that private\ninholdings just riddle the preserve, the government is\nperfectly happy to put up signs which make clear that\nthe -- the plot in question will not in fact be the\ngovernment's, but will be the VFW's.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't that an\ninterference or it's singling out someone, private\nproperty owner, who's using his property in a particular\nway, a religious way? You are going to be putting up\nsigns only for people putting up religious symbols.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I don't think that that is\ncorrect, Mr. Chief Justice. I think that the preserve\nwould put up signs for various historic or cultural or\notherwise important --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it hasn't done\nanything like that. It doesn't say for other property\nowners that have maybe something that -- you know, a\nramshackle shack, that they want people to know this\nisn't the government's property. They don't do anything\nlike that.\nIt's -- under your hypothetical, it would be\nonly religious property that would have these special\nwarning signs.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Well, I suspect that there\nare a great many identification signs throughout the\npreserve, although I don't know precisely what they are.\nAnd this would be one of those, saying essentially that\nthere is this war memorial, that it was put up by the\nVFW, that it is maintained and owned by the VFW.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Who would see it, General\nKagan? Who would see it? I mean, the Seventh Circuit\ncase, it was -- it was on level ground, lots of people\nused the area, and I think the Seventh Circuit required\na fence and a sign. But here, this cross is high on a\ncliff in a desolate area. And if you had a little sign,\nwho would be -- you would have to climb up to it.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I actually think, Justice\nGinsburg, that it would be easy to do. I was out there\nthree or four weeks ago. The superintendent drove me to\nthe site. There is virtually nobody who could see this\nwar memorial in any other way than by going in one of\ntwo directions on Cima Road. And you could put signs up\non Cima Road that said exactly what you were going to\nsee, you know, in 100 yards or a mile or whatever it\nwas.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is the question\nof -- I don't want to get into your rebuttal time, but\nbriefly, how is the question of whether signs are or\naren't valid or required before us in this case? There\nare no signs there, and you are asking us to consider\nwhether the statute is valid or not.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I think, Mr. Chief Justice,\nthat if we were not going to put up signs, it would\nstill be valid. So I should make that completely clear.\nAnd as I said, there are many, many private\nholdings within the preserve, people who could put up\nwhatever religious symbols they wanted to. One simply\nwouldn't know whether it was on private land or on other\nland. But I will say, in addition to that, that the\npreserve's superintendent himself would like to put up a\nsign essentially telling preserve users what the war\nmemorial was and what its provenance was. If some --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't there legislation\nthat requires the original plaque to be reinstated, the\nplaque recognizing the donation and what it means?\nGENERAL KAGAN: That's correct, Justice\nSotomayor. But I have to say that that's more of the\nkind of sign that maybe Justice Ginsburg had in mind,\nwhich is, it's smaller and you would have to go right up\nto the war memorial in order to see it.\nI think it would be very easy to put up\nsigns just on the road to make clear that anybody who\nwas in the area would know that this was land --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This would be on\ngovernment land, that sign? It wouldn't be on the acre\nthat you transferred. I'm a little confused.\nGENERAL KAGAN: The small plaque.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are talking about\nputting --\nGENERAL KAGAN: The small plaque --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would go on the cross?\nGENERAL KAGAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The larger sign you're\ntalking about that you are willing to do is a sign that\nyou would put on government land.\nGENERAL KAGAN: That's correct. And as I\nsaid, it's something that the superintendent would like\nto do and I think would be consistent with signage in\nthe area. If I --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did you raise that\nalternative with the Ninth -- with the district court\nand the Ninth Circuit?\nGENERAL KAGAN: I don't believe it ever came\nup, Justice Sotomayor. We did talk about it in our\nmerits brief to this Court, but I don't think that it\never came up below.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Eliasberg.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER J. ELIASBERG\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ELIASBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nJustice Breyer, I would like to direct my\nbeginning remarks to you. I believe you've correctly\nstated the procedural posture exactly right. The only\nquestion, point that I would make, is that I don't\nbelieve we did -- there was a modification of the\ninjunction here. Any time a defendant passes a piece of\nlegislation after an injunction is first entered, there\nmay be a question as to whether that new statute or\nlegislation is consistent with the injunction. But it's\nnot new relief.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see what the judge did.\nHe said: The motion to enforce the July 24th injunction\nis granted. He said: Buono's motion to amend it is\ndenied. Then he did two other things, which he listed\nsome people and he said they are enjoined from\nimplementing the law.\nNow, I take it that those paragraphs 3 and 4\nare an implementation of the July 24 injunction which he\ngranted, not a new injunction.\nMR. ELIASBERG: That's exactly correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that's the issue here\nthat we were just possibly debating. The issue in the\ncase is whether the district judge might lawfully\nenforce an old injunction in the manner he did, which\nwas to add paragraphs 3 and 4. That question you\nconcede is here.\nMR. ELIASBERG: I believe that's -- that is\nhere and that is really the only question that is here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that under your\napproach that this is looking to see if the injunction\nis being enforced or violated, we would be reviewing an\nact of Congress under an abuse of discretion standard,\nnot -- not de novo?\nMR. ELIASBERG: That's correct. But for\nthis --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Have we ever done\nthat before?\nMR. ELIASBERG: I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Have we ever said\nthat an act of Congress is unconstitutional without a\nde novo review of the merits of the constitutionality?\nMR. ELIASBERG: I am not aware of that, but\nI am also not aware of a situation where the act of\nCongress is being put forth as the response to an\nalready adjudicated constitutional violation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Eliasberg, I thought\nthat the Ninth Circuit the first time around had taken\nmeticulous care to make certain that the issue of the\nvalidity of the statute would not be before the Court in\nthe first round. Judge Kozinski wrote: \"We express no\nview as to whether a transfer completed under Section\n8121 would pass constitutional muster, but leave this\nquestion for another day.\"\nThat's on page 104a of the petition.\nAnd then the district judge said: Yes, I\nrecognize the Ninth Circuit didn't touch the validity of\nthat statute, left it for another day. The day has\ncome. So it is for the first time that the Court is\ndeciding the question of whether section 8121 passes\nconstitutional muster.\nMR. ELIASBERG: The only thing I would\ndisagree with you on that point, Justice Ginsburg, is\nthat the question is whether the act of Congress\nremedies the already adjudicated constitutional\nviolation and is consistent with the injunction.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So when you get to\nthe consistent with the injunction part -- I thought it\nwas your position that we should review this question\nsolely under an abuse of discretion standard?\nMR. ELIASBERG: It is our position --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because while the\nCourt did not decide the validity of the act in the\nfirst case, it certainly did in the second case, which\nis why we have the case before us.\nMR. ELIASBERG: That is correct. We\nbelieve -- but may I make two points, Mr. Chief Justice?\nFirst, we believe in the enforcement context\nwhere the question is, is this a violation of an already\nentered injunction that was part of a final judgment,\nthat that is traditional equity principles that you\nreview for an abuse of discretion. Nonetheless, we\nbelieve that we win even under a de novo standard.\nSo -- and if I could set forth some of the reasons for\nthat.\nI think, Justice Breyer, that you have it\nexactly correct, that what the government has done here\nby selecting a particular transferee who has been given\npreferential access to the land in the past to the\nexclusion of others who wanted to erect other symbols,\nthat the government is taking affirmative steps to\npermit, through this transfer statute, the display of\nthe cross that they are enjoined from doing.\nNow, Justice Scalia, I believe your point is\nat some point if this is on private land and the\ngovernment is not making any efforts to further this\ndisplay, that it couldn't possibly be that the\ninjunction forbids that. And that may well be correct,\nbut that is not the case we have in front of it.\nThe government in this transfer statute has\nmade a significant number of affirmative steps to ensure\nthat the cross remains up. It has selected --\nJUSTICE ALITO: When this injunction was\nfirst entered the statute -- nobody contemplated that\nthis statute was going to be enacted; isn't that\ncorrect?\nMR. ELIASBERG: When the district court\nentered the injunction, that is correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes. So isn't the sensible\ninterpretation of the injunction that it was prohibiting\nthe government from permitting the display of the cross\non government property, and not on private property that\nhappens to be within the Mojave National Preserve?\nMR. ELIASBERG: I don't believe so, Justice\nScalia -- excuse me -- Justice Alito, for a couple of\nreasons. One of the bases for the entry of the\ninjunction in the first instance was the way that the\ngovernment had favored one party to come on, contrary to\nthe government's own regulations, and erect a permanent\nsymbol, while not allowing others.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Wasn't your argument that\nthis was a violation of the Establishment Clause because\nit was on government land? Did you make the argument\nthat even if this was on one of the ranches within the\nMojave National Preserve, it would still be a violation\nof the Establishment Clause?\nMR. ELIASBERG: We did not make that\nargument because it wasn't presented to the Court.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes, it was a totally -- so\nthe situation completely changed and the district court\neither modified the injunction -- it seems to me\nmodified the injunction by interpreting it to mean\nsomething quite different from what anybody contemplated\nit meant when it was originally entered?\nMR. ELIASBERG: Well, I think that, as is\ntraditional equity principles, the district court is at\nsome level the master of its injunction and that's why\nwe give an abuse of discretion standard. The district\ncourt very clearly said: I see this as an attempt by\nthe government not to abide by my injunction; they are\nfavoring the same parties they favored when -- that was\npart of the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, of course, it was\nthat, but the question is whether it was a permissible\namendment by the government of the situation. Of\ncourse, I will stipulate that the government was trying\nto arrange it so that the cross could remain there. But\nthat doesn't mean that it was -- it was evading the\ninjunction. I mean, that's --\nMR. ELIASBERG: Well, I think it is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unless the injunction\nclearly applied to the erection of a cross on private\nland that the government had -- had transferred.\nMR. ELIASBERG: Well, but it's not the\nerection of the cross. It is the transfer of something\nwhere the government has a reversionary interest. It\nvery much directs the way the VFW is likely to use the\nland. It selected a particular transferee who has been\nfavored from the beginning. They didn't say: We're\ngoing to neutrally sell the land in order to allow this\nconstitutional violation to be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I will -- I will concede\nthat the obvious purpose of that was to avoid being in\nviolation of the injunction. But that doesn't mean that\nit's invalid.\nMR. ELIASBERG: Well, I believe it's invalid\nbecause I think that the affirmative steps they are\ntaking here really make them -- put them in a position\nwhere they are permitting --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can -- can -- what,\nwhat -- let's start from the beginning. Can -- would it\nbe proper for the government or would the government be\nalleged to have violated the Establishment Clause if on\nanother ranch that cross -- a cross went up?\nMR. ELIASBERG: No, they would not.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So really\nyour argument is that the reason this Court -- this\ncross on private land, if it becomes private, is\noffensive to the Establishment Clause is because of the\ngovernment's prior history with respect to that cross,\ncorrect? That's -- that's your argument?\nMR. ELIASBERG: That is one part of my\nargument. But there is another part. The government\nhas taken the step of designating this cross one of 49\nnational memorials in the whole country and the only\nnational memorial commemorating American service in\nWorld War I, even though it's clear in the record --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So are you alleging that\ndoing that violates the Establishment Clause, passing or\ndesignating a religious symbol as a national memorial,\nthat that violates the Establishment Clause?\nMR. ELIASBERG: We are alleging that under\nthe totality of the circumstances, which includes the\nnational memorial designation, the government's asserted\npurpose to make sure that the cross remains up, the\ngovernment's favoritism of the same parties that it has\nalways favored in this case to the exclusion of others,\nand the maintaining of the property interest in the land\nin the form of a reversionary interest, all of those\nthings --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does that apply to all\nlands in this preserve?\nMR. ELIASBERG: I'm sorry, does what apply\nto all lands?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does the reversionary\ninterest apply to all of lands on this preserve? Maybe\nyour adversary has to answer that instead of you, but\nall of the other private property owners.\nMR. ELIASBERG: No, the reversionary\ninterest specifically says the land reverts to the\ngovernment if --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. Are all of\nthe private owners on this preserve required to give the\nland back to the U.S. if they put it to some different\nuse?\nMR. ELIASBERG: I don't believe that that\nis true.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if -- if --\nif the government sold this land to a private party, no\ncross in the picture at all, and they go to settlement\nand at settlement the private landowner who is going to\nbuy it says, you know, I'm going to put a big cross up\non this property once I get it, can the government still\nsell it to him?\nMR. ELIASBERG: Yes, absolutely.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMR. ELIASBERG: If the basis for the\ngovernment's decision to sell the -- sell the land was a\nneutral basis. And that's what we are saying here. If\nwhat the government has done --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So even though\nbefore the sale, even though the government knows there\nis going to be a big cross on the land with the same\nsituation you have here in the middle of the preserve\nand all, that's perfectly okay?\nMR. ELIASBERG: No, it's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you said\nbefore the government sold the land if they find out the\nnew owner is going to put a cross on it there is no\nproblem.\nMR. ELIASBERG: The difference between those\ntwo scenarios, Mr. Chief Justice, is one is a remedial\ncontext. The government has been held to violate the\nConstitution. They have to, under Milliken v. Bradley\nand U.S. v. Virginia, take all steps necessary to erase\nthat constitutional violation.\nThe situation in the first hypothetical you\ngave me, there has never been an adjudicated\nconstitutional violation. It's a very different\nsituation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it also a very\ndifferent case if a condition of the transfer is that\nthe transferee will preserve a memorial that has been\ndesignated in the statute as a five-foot-tall white\ncross.\nMR. ELIASBERG: I think that is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So it is a condition of\nthe transfer.\nMR. ELIASBERG: As I was stating to Justice\nSotomayor, that is one of the factors that we believe\nseparates this situation from the kind of hypotheticals\nthat you're setting forth.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you disagree with\nwhat she told us, which is that the private property\nowner can tear down the cross at any time?\nMR. ELIASBERG: I think that there are very\nsignificant obstacles to their doing that. One, I don't\n-- I disagree with the General's -- General Kagan's\ndescription of the criminal statute that prohibits the\ndefacement of memorials on private land, because one of\nthe provisions is that we will consider it a situation\nthat is covered by the statute that the land be under\nthe jurisdiction of the Federal Government. Well, the\nland -- the statute that designated the Mojave Preserve\nvery clearly says that the land is being transferred\nfrom the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management\nto the National Park Service and the Secretary of the\nInterior, so it is therefore clearly under the\njurisdiction of the Federal Government. So I think that\nthere is -- there are possible criminal violations.\nThere is also a significant question --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say under the\njurisdiction of the Federal Government. Does that -- do\nyou just mean they have authority to regulate the land?\nMR. ELIASBERG: That's correct. But that's\nthe way the statute is written, under Federal\njurisdiction, so I believe that those two terms --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose they\nhave jurisdiction to regulate a lot of -- lot of land\nthat they don't own.\nMR. ELIASBERG: Well I think that in this\ncase when the government is actually -- there's quite a\nbit of case law -- we set forth some in our brief --\nwhere they talk about the government's power over land\nthat's within a national preserve, so I do think that\nthe criminal statutes may very well apply.\nIt certainly would be a barrier to the VFW's\nthinking, well, no risk to us if we tear this cross\ndown. In addition, the government is required, as I\nbelieve one of the Justices and I don't remember\nwhich -- the government has been required to go back and\nput up a plaque that says: This cross erected in honor\nof the foreign war dead. It would be very odd indeed, I\nbelieve for the VFW --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What else -- what\nelse does the plaque say.\nMR. ELIASBERG: The plaque says: \"This\ncross\" -- in big letters -- \"erected in honor of the\ndead of foreign wars.\" I think it would be very --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's it?\nNothing else?\nMR. ELIASBERG: Nothing else. I think it\nwould be very odd indeed for the VFW to feel that it was\nfree to take down the cross and put up, for example, a\nstatues of a soldier which would honor all of the people\nwho fought for America in World War I, not just\nChristians, and say: Well, we were free to do that\nbecause even though there's the sign that says, this\ncross is designated to honor all the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The cross doesn't honor\nnon-Christians who fought in the war? Is that -- is\nthat --\nMR. ELIASBERG: I believe that's actually\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where does it say that?\nMR. ELIASBERG: It doesn't say that, but a\ncross is the predominant symbol of Christianity and it\nsignifies that Jesus is the son of God and died to\nredeem mankind for our sins, and I believe that's why\nthe Jewish war veterans --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's erected as a war\nmemorial. I assume it is erected in honor of all of the\nwar dead. It's the -- the cross is the -- is the most\ncommon symbol of -- of -- of the resting place of the\ndead, and it doesn't seem to me -- what would you have\nthem erect? A cross -- some conglomerate of a cross, a\nStar of David, and you know, a Moslem half moon and\nstar?\nMR. ELIASBERG: Well, Justice Scalia, if I\nmay go to your first point. The cross is the most\ncommon symbol of the resting place of Christians. I\nhave been in Jewish cemeteries. There is never a cross\non a tombstone of a Jew.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ELIASBERG: So it is the most common\nsymbol to honor Christians.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think you can leap\nfrom that to the conclusion that the only war dead that\nthat cross honors are the Christian war dead. I think\nthat's an outrageous conclusion.\nMR. ELIASBERG: Well, my -- the point of\nmy -- point here is to say that there is a reason the\nJewish war veterans came in and said we don't feel\nhonored by this cross. This cross can't honor us\nbecause it is a religious symbol of another religion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I get back to\nyour plaque question? Am I wrong? I think the\ngovernment told us the plaque reads: \"The cross erected\nin memory the dead of all wars, erected 1934 by members\nof Veterans of Foreign Wars, Death Valley Post 2884.\"\nMR. ELIASBERG: That is correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and I apologize. I forgot --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a big\ndifference. I mean, the whole point is that the plaque\ntells you, this is not a government memorial, government\nstructure. It was put up by members of the Veterans of\nForeign Wars, Death Valley Post 2884.\nMR. ELIASBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, the\ncontext of your question was would VFW feel constrained\nto keep the cross up? And my point was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The context of my\nquestion was what does the plaque say?\nMR. ELIASBERG: Well -- I -- I apologize for\nnot giving the full text, that was not my intention to\n-- to mislead the Court or to you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right.\nMR. ELIASBERG: My only point is that in\nthat scenario, because did I believe we were talking\nabout, is the VFW free to do this, and I was pointing to\nthe criminal statute that I said I believe said that\nthey couldn't -- wouldn't feel free to take this down.\nBut second of all, that it would be odd indeed for them\nto take it down when there is a big plaque that says\nthis cross erected. With all of the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: When the Solicitor General\nrepresents to us that the VFW will be perfectly free to\nmodify this memorial in any way it chooses if they\nobtain title to this land, do you think that there's any\nrealistic fear that they will be required to maintain\nthis cross, even if they wish to -- to change it in some\nway?\nMR. ELIASBERG: Well, I think that there is\na real -- well, but -- but I don't think that the cases\nturn on whether a prosecutor says well, I promise you\nthat we are not going to enforce the statute. I think\nwe have to look at the words of the statute and the\nwords of the reversionary interest, and I think they\nboth create significant doubt as to whether the VFW\nwould feel free to turn this -- to take it down, in the\nsame way that in a context where you are talking about\npre-enforcement --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I thought your\nargument was that although there was going to be a\nformal transfer of title, as a practical matter, the\ngovernment was still involved with the maintenance of\nthe cross on this land. And when the government says\nthat that's not the case, I don't know why that doesn't\ncure the practical problem.\nMR. ELIASBERG: Well, that -- the -- the\nquestion of government -- continued government\ninvolvement with the land, I believe, continues, because\nof the reversionary interest and because of the\ndesignation as a national memorial. Whatever the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think -- I think\nGeneral Kagan agreed that they -- the Veterans couldn't\nsubstitute some other memorial, if it's going to be a\nnational monument it has to have the government's\napproval. And the only one that has the government's\napproval is the cross.\nMR. ELIASBERG: That is correct, Justice\nGinsburg. I don't want to speak for General Kagan but\nwith respect to the question --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I -- I thought the\ngovernment's position was it had to be maintained as a\nnational war -- as a war memorial, but not that it had\nto be maintained as a cross.\nMR. ELIASBERG: That is the government's\nposition. But Justice Ginsburg, your question is would\nsomething else they put up be a national memorial, and\nthe answer is no. Only Congress has the power to\ndesignate a national memorial. Congress has chosen to\ndesignate this particular stand-alone Latin cross as a\ngovernment -- as a national memorial.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the\ngovernment's argument that suppose the government took\ndown the cross, gave it back to the Veterans of Foreign\nWars, sold them the land in exchange for land of equal\nvalue, and then the Veterans said, fine, the cross was\nours to begin with. Now the land is ours, so we just\nput it back. If that would be consistent with the\ninjunction?\nThe government now has nothing to do with\nthe cross. It's all the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and\nit can't be regarded a sham because it was originally\nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars who put it up, the\ngovernment didn't put it up.\nMR. ELIASBERG: I believe that that --\nobviously not the facts presented by our case, Justice\nGinsburg, but that likely would be consistent with the\ninjunction, that's correct. But it is not the scenario\nwe have here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then we are talking about\nsomething that is rather formal rather than substantial.\nIf -- if all the government would have to do is say,\nCongress, you didn't get it right. You should have just\nmade the land swap. And then the government would take\ndown the cross in compliance with the injunction, and\nthen it goes right back the next day.\nMR. ELIASBERG: Well, I think if there -- if\nthere were -- I think it's not just formalism, Your\nHonor, because one, the reversionary -- I am assuming\nthat in your hypothetical the reversionary interest is\ngone. That is continuing government ownership, future\nownership in property, and one of the government's\nprincipal arguments is when we sell to it a private\nowner everyone presumes that the private owner is the\nspeaker.\nBut when the government maintains a\nsubstantial future property interest, they haven't sold\nthe land. They've sold part of their interest in the\nland. So if you take away the reversionary interest and\nyou remove the national memorial designation and then\nthe VFW independently does choose to put up the cross,\nit's more than formalism. It is the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But there is also the\npoint that I don't think you stressed, that if the\nreversionary interest was activated -- say they\nabandoned or destroyed it, the property would come back\nto the government. And if I read the -- the designation\nof the national memorial statute correctly, the\nDepartment of Interior would have to rebuild the old\ncross and put it up. There's an affirmative duty to\nreplace the cross if there is a reversion.\nMR. ELIASBERG: I believe that that is\ncorrect, Justice Stevens, and that's an important point\nthat is intertwined with the fact that the reversionary\ninterest also continues the government's ownership in\nthe land, when their whole position is, if we privatize\nit, as Justice Scalia pointed out, if it's just a\nprivate owner, then we don't associate this cross with\nthe government. We associate it with the private owner.\nBut the government hasn't done that. It has\nmaintained an important ownership interest in the land\nthrough that reversionary interest. If there are no\nfurther questions, I will --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question:\nDo you think the issues in this case would be -- stay\nthe same or different, if this whole scenario occurred\non the Mall in -- right out in front of the\nWashington -- the Lincoln Memorial?\nWould the -- the issues be any different if\nit were not an isolated memorial in the desert?\nMR. ELIASBERG: Context has always mattered\nto this Court in Establishment Clause cases.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And which way would it\ncut, if it is different?\nMR. ELIASBERG: Well, I do think that\nWashington is, certainly, a seat of power, and there is,\nobviously, a close tie between something that is put on\nthe National Mall in the seat of government, but I do\nthink that the designation of a national memorial is\nalso significant.\nSo, even though this may be an area that is\nnot nearly as populated as Washington, D.C., it is very\nsignificant that Congress has taken the step with this\nparticular symbol, one of only 49 in the country,\ngrouping it with other iconic statues and memorials in\nthis country and tied it.\nSo I don't think that the distinction,\nalthough it might have some bearing in the Court, in\nthinking of the context, I don't think it would change\nthe result.\nJustice Kennedy, I want to go back to -- to\none question you had asked earlier about the posture,\nand I just want to reiterate. You, very clearly, said,\nwhen the government was saying, well, we didn't have a\ngood reason to bring this to the Court, and that's why\nwe didn't, I think your question recognized that the\ngovernment had very good reasons.\nBut -- but in addition, it's not really\nimportant, when you have a final judgment, why a party\nchooses not to try to take the last step of appeal on a\nfinal judgment, and that's the United States v.\nMunsingwear case.\nThe government chose not to make that step.\nThe judgment was final, and there, certainly, is no\nbasis for this Court to reopen the issues about whether\nMr. Buono had standing in the first instance.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, wasn't -- isn't this\nvery different from the situation in Toledo\nSteel because -- Scale, I'm sorry -- because, if the\nmerits issue that was before the Ninth Circuit was, if\nnot technically moot, nearly moot, by the time they\nreached it, because of the passage of the new statute.\nThis wasn't -- they said it's not moot\nbecause this is simply the voluntary cessation of\nconduct that's been held to be unlawful, but that is\ntypically applied in the situation where there is a\nlegitimate fear that the -- the party that has been held\nto be violating the Constitution may simply return to\nits bad old ways, once the litigation is over.\nBut, here, you have the intervening\nenactment of a statute by the Constitution -- by the\nCongress of the United States, and I think it would be\nquite far-fetched to presume that Congress is simply\ngoing to repeal the statute and go back to the way\nthings were, once the litigation is over.\nSo you have a merits issue that's not -- if\ntechnically moot, nearly moot. The real merits issue in\nthe case is -- is expressly not decided by the Ninth\nCircuit. They say, take that back to the district\ncourt. And you say that the standing issue goes away\nbecause the government didn't appeal the standing issue\nat a time when the real merits issue in the case had not\nbeen decided.\nMR. ELIASBERG: Well, two points, if I may,\nJustice Alito. First, the first reason that the Ninth\nCircuit gave for why the case wasn't moot was not\nvoluntary cessation. The government conceded the land\ntransfer could take up to two years to effectuate, so in\nthe Ninth Circuit, that this case is far from moot.\nTwo years is more than enough time to file\nthe government to file the petition for certiorari and\nhad a ruling, both on the merits of the land on -- the\ncross on government property, but more important, as a\nnumber of Justices had pointed out, the question of\nstanding to bring an Establishment Clause case, the\ngovernment always have an interest in saying, this case\nshould never have been brought. We never should had\nhave had a judgment entered against us.\nFor the government to say, we didn't really\ncare at that point because, two years from now, the\ntransfer might be effectuated is not basis for them to\nargue that there was no final judgment and no reason for\nus to appeal.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think General Kagan\nrecognized that there isn't an example of a final\ninjunction, where, after it's final as it can be, you\ncan come back and say, but, now, I want to reargue the\nstanding question that's already been determined.\nBut there was something that I did want to\nask you about, Judge O'Scanlon's opinion. He said,\nif -- if you prevail and you are right, what happens in\nArlington Cemetery, where there's the Argonne Cross\nMemorial and the Canadian Cross of Sacrifice, both right\nhere in Arlington, what happens to them?\nMR. ELIASBERG: Going back, Justice\nGinsburg, to the merits on the earlier question about a\ncross on government property, I believe that the Argonne\nCross in the national -- in memorial cemetery is\nextremely different.\nThere are, in the national cemeteries,\nthe -- the VA offers, to veterans and their family, a\nchoice of putting up 39 different emblems and beliefs on\ntheir tombstones. In Arlington, there is a cross that\nis surrounded by a sea of tombstones with symbols of the\nfaith of all of the different service members.\nIn that context, I don't think anyone would\nperceive that the government was favoring one particular\nreligion because of the variety of choices and religious\nsymbols expressed there. That's very different from a\nstand-alone cross of one religious symbol that is not\nsurrounded by any other context, other than --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Has the government ever\nturned down -- let's say the Jewish war veterans request\nto put up a war memorial on --\nMR. ELIASBERG: They did. There was a\nrequest made for -- to put up a memorial on the site,\nand the government said no and said, our regulations\nforbid it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I am talking about -- on\nthis site?\nMR. ELIASBERG: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know, well, I'm not\ntalking about this site, where there already was a\nmemorial, but suppose the -- what I'm getting at is I\ndon't agree with you, that -- that every time the\ngovernment allows any religious symbol to be erected, it\nhas to allow all religious symbols to be erected at the\nsame place, so long as it is -- it is not discriminatory\nin -- in accepting or rejecting requests to erect\nreligious symbols in different places.\nI don't see why the government is convicted\nof being discriminatory.\nMR. ELIASBERG: I think the context here is\nwhat has the government done with respect to national\nmemorials. The only two national memorials that are\nstand-alone religious symbols are of one particular\nreligious denomination, and that's Christianity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but you don't --\nand they -- were both of them proposed by a private\ngroup, such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars?\nMR. ELIASBERG: Well, it's Congress -- I\ndon't know that the Veterans of Foreign Wars ever\nproposed that this be a national memorial. Congress\ndesignated it as one.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but it was erected by\nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars. I mean, do you know of\nany instance in which Jewish war veterans or if there is\nan organization of Muslim war veterans, requested to\nerect a memorial on public land, it was turned down?\nMR. ELIASBERG: As I said before --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I just don't see why they\nall have to be on the same piece of land, in -- in order\nfor the government to be impartial.\nMR. ELIASBERG: I'm not saying that in --\nin -- that, in every circumstance, the government has to\nhave lots of different symbols, but what the government\nhas done here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think you are\nsaying that, and you are saying that this has to be a\npublic forum. In fact, I'm not even sure your -- your\nbrief would limit it to religious symbols. You say it\nhas to be an open forum. Right?\nMR. ELIASBERG: Well, Justice Scalia, if I\nmake one prefatory point, the government didn't bring to\nthis Court the merits of the question of whether the\ncross was permissible on government property.\nThere is a final judgment set in this\ncircumstance. In this context, it is not. So that\nquestion is not properly before us, but context matters,\nand I do think, in other circumstances, there may be\nreligious symbols. There may be a myriad of religious\nsymbols and the context of the situation will matter.\nBut I think if, in Arlington, for example --\nwith respect to Justice Ginsburg's question. If, for\nexample, a foreign government -- let's take the Canadian\nCross of Sacrifice, which the government has put in its\nbrief, was donated by a foreign government to honor\npeople -- Americans who fought for Canada and the\nBritish Empire, in I believe it was World War I, if the\nState of Israel made a similar request to the United\nStates, we would like to honor the Jews who fought in\nOperation Iraqi Freedom because we believe that that was\nan important defense of the State of Israel, and the\nUnited States said, no, we are not interested, I think\nthat that would create a quite significant\nconstitutional violation -- or constitutional question,\nbut it's not the case in front of us.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a different\nquestion, just based on your understanding of all these\nmonuments? Are there any other federal monuments that\ncontained crosses, other than those associated with the\ncemeteries?\nMR. ELIASBERG: The one national memorial\nthat I am aware of that has a cross, it is of Father\nMarquette, who was a significant historical figure. It\nis not a stand-alone cross. It is Father Marquette\nsurrounded by a number of various objects that show his\nrole as a historical figure, exploring the middle west,\nand he is holding a cross.\nBut, again, I think -- I agree with General\nKagan that, if we honored Martin Luther King, who was a\npriest, or we honored -- we did something with the Old\nNorth Church which had significant historical\nsignificance, that would create a very different issue\nthan simply a stand-alone cross, where, when the\nNational Park Service asked its own historian to\ndetermine whether it had historical value necessary to\nbring it within the National Register of Historic\nPlaces, the Park Service's own historian said, no, it\ndid not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, this\nprobably doesn't have anything to do with anything, but\nI'm just kind of curious, why is this cross put up --\nyou know, in the middle of nowhere?\n(Laughter. )\nMR. ELIASBERG: Because the man who\noriginally put up the cross -- not this one, because it\nhas been replaced a number of times, but the man who put\nup this particular cross, I believe was a homesteader in\nthe area when the land was owned by the Bureau of Land\nManagement, and I believe was a miner on the land. I\nhope that is correct historically. I believe it is.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.\nGeneral, you have 2 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELENA KAGAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nGENERAL KAGAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nTo pick up right there, this stand-alone\ncross was erected as a World War I memorial by veterans\nof World War I who had gone to the desert in California\nto recuperate and to restore their lives.\nAnd it was that situation that the -- that\nthe Congress was presented with, was when the Ninth\nCircuit ruled and said that this memorial was\nunconstitutional, Congress had a choice. And the choice\nwas to take down that memorial, which meant an enormous\namount to veterans in the community, or to completely\ndissociate the government from that memorial. And what\nCongress did was to completely dissociate the government\nfrom that memorial while allowing some war memorial to\nstand.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How can you say that when\nthere's a reversionary interest? How can you say it's\ncompletely dissociated? There is a reversionary\ninterest if they don't maintain the cross, which is the\nmonument, it goes back to the government.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Justice Stevens, with\nrespect, the reversionary interest says that the holder,\nthe VFW, has to maintain a war memorial. It does not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the particular\nmemorial described by Congress was this cross.\nGENERAL KAGAN: No, the reversionary\ninterest simply says: A war memorial. It does not have\nto be this war memorial.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but then it doesn't\n-- I don't think it's fair to interpret Congress's\ninterest to being and preserving this memorial.\nGENERAL KAGAN: To the contrary, Justice\nStevens. When Congress wanted to say \"this memorial,\"\nit knew to how to say it, because it said it in the 2002\nact.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nGENERAL KAGAN: In the 2004 act, it said\nsomething very different. That was after the injunction\nhad issued, so it was a completely different set of\ncircumstances. Congress understood that an injunction\nagainst this war memorial had issued. Congress said:\nWe are going to give this back to the VFW, but it's\ngoing to be the VFW's choice now as to what to do with\nit, consistent with it being some kind of war memorial.\nA reversionary interest of a kind that Congress often\nuses to -- when it transfers land. Congress -- it's a\ncompletely --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think anyone\nthought there is the remotest possibility they would put\nup a different memorial?\nGENERAL KAGAN: I think it's left to the\nVFW, and it's entirely the VFW's choice. So if tomorrow\nor ten years from now or 50 years from now the VFW\ndecides, along with Respondents, that a cross is an\ninappropriate war memorial, then they can take down that\nwar memorial. It's no longer the government's message.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How can they say it's an\ninappropriate war memorial when Congress has designated\nthe national memorial as, quote, \"the five-foot-tall\nwhite cross\" and so forth and so on? That is what is\nthe memorial.\nGENERAL KAGAN: But there is no -- there is\nno prohibition on the VFW taking down this memorial. We\nwill just have one fewer national memorials. And --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you really think there\nis any possibility that would happen?\nGENERAL KAGAN: Again, I think it is\nentirely up to the VFW.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That is not my question.\nGENERAL KAGAN: I don't know, because I am\nnot the VFW. It is up to the VFW as to what happens to\nthis war memorial. That's also true of the plaque, that\nthe plaque could -- the VFW could take down the plaque\nonce the -- the VFW gains title to this property.\nSo what the government has done here -- and\nJustice Stevens, I don't want to -- of course, you are\nright that Congress started out thinking they --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They not only started it\nout, but they authorized the use of $10,000 in money in\norder to replace the very cross they had designated as a\nmemorial.\nGENERAL KAGAN: Justice Stevens, you are, of\ncourse, right that Congress thought at the beginning,\nprior to the injunction, that this war memorial should\nnot be taken down, that there was an attachment to it in\nthe local community, and that it was -- that it should\nbe retained. Not an unnatural thing for Congress to\nwant, to preserve war memorials.\nWhen the injunction issued and when the\ncourt found that the -- when the Congress found that the\ncourts had declared this display of this memorial\nunconstitutional, Congress said: How can we preserve\nthis -- preserve a war memorial, very possibly this war\nmemorial? How can we preserve a war memorial but have\nit not be our choice?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nCounsel, counsel.\n"
