        "content": "(1:00 p.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Nken v. Phillips.\nMs. Harrison.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LINDSAY C. HARRISON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. HARRISON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn 1996 Congress provided in 8 U.S.C.\n1252(b)(3)(B) that courts may stay an alien's order of\nremoval pending appeal. The question in this case is\nwhether Congress intended that temporary stays of\nremoval be governed by the normal standards applicable\nto States or instead by the special standard that\nCongress separately set forth for injunctions in\n1252(f)(2). There are three primary reasons why the\nnormal stay standard should apply.\nFirst, Congress used different words to\ndescribe these different forms of relief, \"stay\" in\n(b)(3)(B) and \"enjoin\" in (f)(2). Congress used\ndifferent words because it saw these forms of relief as\ndifferent.\nSecond and related, a stay is in fact\ndifferent from an injunction. It is a temporary vacatur\nof a court or vacancy order pending review. It is not\ndirected at a party and does not order a party to take\naction.\nThird, even an alien with a strong\nlikelihood of success on the merits who will face\ncertain persecution if deported cannot get a stay under\nthe (f)(2) standard, a result Congress should not be\npresumed to authorize in the absence of a clear\nstatement to that effect.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I'm not\nsure this matters very much, But do you know if -- are\nstays usually granted in this type of case? Not this\ntype of case: A removal case as opposed to an\napplication to reopen.\nMS. HARRISON: In a removal case stays are\ngranted in eight circuits only if the individual meets\nthe traditional --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, I understand\nit. I am just saying if you happen to know empirically\nif most people who are facing removal get a stay.\nMS. HARRISON: I have seen no empirical --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the government -- I\nthought the government said that an empirical database\nwould be the Ninth Circuit, which has the more generous\nrule.\nMS. HARRISON: That's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My understanding is that\nstays are granted in a very high percentage of those\ncases. I would be curious to know, A, the percentage of\nthe cases in which it's granted; and B, the percentage\nof those cases that are ultimately decided in favor of\nthe government?\nMS. HARRISON: The data that I believe Your\nHonor is referencing was the rate at which petitions for\nreview are filed, and not the rate at which stays are\ngranted or filed.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is it true that\nthere are more petitions filed in the courts with the\nmore generous standards?\nMS. HARRISON: Again, I have not seen a\ncomprehensive study. There are more petitions filed in\nthe Ninth Circuit, but there is no evidence of the cause\nof that. And -- and I think it's important that stays\nare in fact denied under the traditional standard,\nbecause what that demonstrates is that the traditional\nstandard effectuates Congress's purpose of passing\nIIRIRA and eliminating the automatic stay and making it\nin fact more difficult for an individual to obtain a\nstay on appeal. That -- the traditional standard does\nhave real teeth and it does not result in an automatic\nstay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How many years ago was\nthe automatic stay eliminated? When did this -- the\ncurrent law come into effect?\nMS. HARRISON: At the same time in 1996.\nCongress both eliminated the automatic stay, and it\nreplaced it with the language in 1252(b)(3)(B), which\nindicates that a stay is not automatic unless a court\norders otherwise. And -- now, that language was nearly\nidentical to the language that had previously existed,\nwhere a stay was automatic except for aggravated felons.\nFor aggravated felons, the statute provided that a stay\nwas not automatic unless a court otherwise directs. And\ncourts had interpreted that language to provide for\napplication of the traditional stay standards.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it possible in\nthis case to kind of split the baby? You have a more\nappealing fact case than is typical, because yours\ninvolves a denial of a motion to reopen and doesn't\nreally go to the ultimate merits. Most of the petitions\nI think do go to the ultimate merits, and it's easier to\nsee that (f)(2) may apply there as opposed to your case.\nNow, is there a coherent way of saying that?\nIn other words, in your type of case, you apply the\ntraditional stay standards, but in a case where the\nissue that is before the court is whether to order\nremoval or not on the merits, the other approach\napplies.\nMS. HARRISON: I think that the way to do\nthat, Your Honor, is to apply (f)(2) where the alien is\nseeking permanent relief. And where the alien is\nseeking to enjoin his or her removal, the (f)(2)\nstandard makes a lot of sense, but the (f)(2) standard\ndoesn't contain any predictive language. It doesn't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's\njust really saying the way that you avoid that is to say\nyou win across the board. I mean, it -- my\nunderstanding is that in situations in which they are\ngoing to be seeking an injunction to enjoin are quite\nlimited. They are typically just seeking to vacate the\nlegal order.\nMS. HARRISON: And if you then apply the\n(f)(2) standard across the board to stay requests, then\nwhat that would mean is that the court of appeals is\ndeciding the merits twice: It's deciding it at the\noutset when determining whether or not the individual is\nentitled to a stay; and then it's deciding it again when\nthe court decides whether the individual's entitled to\nhave the order of removal vacated. And that just\ndoesn't seem like what Congress had in --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I think I\nunderstand that point when they're seeking to have the\norder -- the removal order vacated. But here you are\nseeking the reopening of the proceedings, which I guess\nis a little different, isn't it, than the underlying\ndecision on the merits?\nMS. HARRISON: Technically, the order of\nremoval is the order denying the motion to reopen, so\nthey are one and the same, in this case and in any case\nwhere the petition for review is of an order of removal,\nwhich is what the statute provides for. And I think\nthat point is very important --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that right? How\ncan that be? I mean, you have an order of removal, and\nthen you move to reopen the proceedings. Aren't they\ntwo separate things?\nMS. HARRISON: Well, the statute provides\nthat an order denying a motion to reopen is itself an\norder of removal, and that it's consolidated with the\noriginal order of removal on appeal. So that they\nbecome one and the same case, and the order denying the\nmotion to reopen is the order of removal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where does it say\nthat?\nMS. HARRISON: I do not believe that it is\nin 1252 itself, and I don't have the citation for you.\nI'm sorry, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMS. HARRISON: Back to the point that it's\nimportant to recognize that the (f)(2) standard contains\nno predictive language, it doesn't allow a court to say,\nis this individual likely to succeed on the merits? It\nsays can this individual show, by clear and convincing\nevidence, that the entry or execution of the removal\norder is prohibited by law, not likely to show, not we\nare likely to find.\nAnd so if courts were required to apply this\nstandard at the stay stage, they would be deciding the\nvery same question twice. They would be deciding both\nthe merits question of whether the individual removal\norder is prohibited by law and also the stay question of\nwhether it should be stayed pending --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That wouldn't be deciding\nit the same way twice. Initially, they would just have\nto decide whether -- whether the alien has shown by\nclear and convincing evidence that he should win, and if\nthey decide no, he hasn't, then at the merits stage they\nhave to decide which one prevails by a preponderance of\nthe evidence. So it's really a different call the\nsecond time.\nMS. HARRISON: Well, Your Honor, the\ngovernment has stated in its brief that it believes\nthese two standards to be virtually identical. And in\nthe event that a stay was granted, it would certainly\nrender the merits decision superfluous because, if a\nstay was granted and you could meet this higher burden,\nthen perforce you could meet the lower burden.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's true.\nMS. HARRISON: And so, in that situation,\n(b)(3)(B) would be superfluous.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you claim that\n(f)(2) covers, if it doesn't cover these stays?\nMS. HARRISON: It covers any time an alien\nseeks an injunction, now, both in the courts of appeals\nand in a district court case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How can that be?\nMS. HARRISON: Well, the Catholic Social\nServices case is one example where individuals were\nchallenging the procedures whereby their legalization\napplications were adjudicated under the Immigration\nReform and Control Act. And in that case, they sought\ninjunctive relief as a class to enjoin their removal\npending that case and permanently, in fact, because they\nsaid they were entitled to legalization, which was an\namnesty statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's --\nthat's kind of a systemic challenge, but you wouldn't\nhave a situation where you get an injunction in far more\ntypical individual cases, right?\nMS. HARRISON: Well, if an individual in\nthat case, Your Honor, attempted to enjoin his or her\nremoval, then the (f)(2) standard would certainly apply\nto that individual. And there's -- there's a reason why\nan individual couldn't have brought that challenge as\nopposed to a class.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why would he seek to enjoin\nhis removal when he is subject to a much lesser standard\nwhen he just seeks to stay the removal? I mean, does he\nhave a bad lawyer or what?\nMS. HARRISON: Well, in that case, it would\nbe in a district court, which doesn't have supervisory\nauthority over the court of appeals -- I'm sorry --\nover the BIA's order. And so the district court\npresumably couldn't stay an order that it wasn't\nreviewing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't he go to the\ncourt of appeals, is the next question.\nMS. HARRISON: Well, he perhaps might, but\nif there was a delay in the procedure or if there was\nsome reason why --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a fluke. I mean,\nthat is a flukey situation. And I find it hard to\nbelieve that (f)(2) was meant to address just that.\nMS. HARRISON: Well, it would be in any\ncase, even in the court of appeals, where an individual\nsought an injunction as opposed to a stay. For example,\nif it was a situation like the Singh case in the Ninth\nCircuit, where there was a stay of removal in place, but\nthe agency was deporting the individual anyway. Then\nthe individual would need to obtain an injunction, and\nin fact that was essentially what the Ninth Circuit\nordered, was a remand for the imposition of an\ninjunction against --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Also a fluke. We don't\nexpect the -- the executive to ignore a stay.\nMS. HARRISON: No, Your Honor. I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I think it's a fluke, too,\nbut you gave -- to my recollection, I forget where it\nwas -- I think you gave citations to three or four cases\nin which that actually happened.\nMS. HARRISON: The Singh case, Your Honor,\nis one of those cases. There's also the Lindstrom case\nfrom the Seventh Circuit. And it does happen that,\neither because of a miscommunication or some other\nreason, that the stay is not effective, and in that case\nan injunction would be.\nAnd I think, in order to address the Court's\nconcern that (f)(2) is a fluke, it's important to take a\nlook at where it appears in the statute and its context.\nNow, originally, the statute contained only (f)(1),\nwhich says that you cannot obtain injunctions as a\nclass, but that individuals can obtain injunctions.\nThere was no (f)(2).\nThe bill went to conference and then\nCongress added in (f)(2), I think to make very clear\nthat, although they had carved out this exception in\n(f)(1) for individual cases, that it was not to be\ngranted as a matter of course, that even in particular\ncases, which is the subtitle of (f)(2), the standard\nshould be very strict. And so I think Congress saw\nitself as closing a potential hole here, because it had\ncreated this opportunity to obtain an injunction as an\nindividual without articulating a standard. Then\nCongress went about articulating standard in (f)(2).\nAnd it's a very high standard.\nNow, Congress did not cross-reference\n(b)(3)(B), which is the stay provision, and in fact, in\nthe transitional rules, what Congress did was it only --\nit only included a provision that was identical to\n(b)(3)(B). It did not include (f)(2) in the\ntransitional rules, which -- all of which demonstrate\nthat Congress did not see (f)(2) and (b)(3)(B) as\nrelated; they saw them as separate with (f)(2) governing\ninjunctions and (b)(3)(B) governing stays.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe I'm missing\nsomething but -- and, again, I don't know which way this\ncuts, but the dispute strikes me as very academic as a\npractical matter: Judges looking at whether someone is\nlikely to prevail on the merits versus judges looking at\nwhether the person has shown by clear and convincing\nevidence that he shouldn't be removed. The judge that's\ngoing to find one in one case, depending on the\nstandard, and the opposite in the same case I can't\nvisualize.\nMS. HARRISON: Well, the key I believe, Your\nHonor, is the equities. Now, the (f)(2) standard does\nnot permit consideration of the equities in determining\nwhether removal is prohibited by law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't? You're\ntalking about equities or irreparable harm?\nMS. HARRISON: Both, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Both standards?\nMS. HARRISON: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Same thing. And you\ncannot consider that at all under (f)(2)? There's no\nway in which the removal would be prohibited as a matter\nof law under provisions that are concerned, for example,\nabout whether the person would be tortured or something\nlike that?\nMS. HARRISON: Well -- well, Your Honor,\nunder the (f)(2) standard, take, for example, someone\nwho had applied for asylum, and it was denied on a\nprocedural technicality, and the question is: Was the\nentry of the execution -- entry or execution of the\nremoval order prohibited by law?\nThat -- the issue of whether the\ntechnicality was a -- was a correct finding or was not a\ncorrect finding permits no consideration of whether or\nnot that individual, if they are deported, is going to\nface persecution, torture, death, et cetera. Only under\nthe -- the traditional --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because the\nobjection is on this procedural matter?\nMS. HARRISON: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if the objection\nis that I am going to be tortured so you shouldn't order\nmy removal, he would be able to -- the court under\n(f)(2) would be able to consider that, wouldn't it?\nMS. HARRISON: I don't believe so, Your\nHonor, unless the very question that was being decided\nis whether the individual had met the -- met the\nstandard for relief under the Convention Against\nTorture. But there are also cases where an individual\nis seeking asylum, and there are questions about whether\n-- whether the persecution is on the basis of a\nprotected class.\nNow, the question there is not whether or\nnot the person is likely to suffer irreparable harm if\nthey go back, but, rather, what is the basis on which\nthey may be entitled to asylum? And so the Court in\nBohegan --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Don't they get to\npursue that even after they are sent back? There are\nprovisions that -- that their case does not abate just\nbecause they have been removed?\nMS. HARRISON: That is true, Your Honor.\nHowever, their case may abate because they are killed,\nthey are put in jail, they are not in a position to come\nback to this country. And that is why consideration of\nthe equities in this context is so critical and why\nCongress would not have eliminated the equities from the\nconsideration without a very clear statement-\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess that's\nwhy -- I guess that goes back to my earlier question,\nwhich is, I see that if they are killed the case is\nprobably not in very good shape. But -- but the\nsituations in which they are likely to face that sort of\ndifficulties upon removal it would seem to me are\nsituations where the removal would be prohibited by law.\nMS. HARRISON: Well, Your Honor, that was --\nthe court of appeals would only be allowed to consider\nthat if the question presented was whether they had\nproven that they were likely to be killed if they were\nreturned to the country. But that often is not what --\nthe question that the court of appeals is deciding.\nIt is deciding a procedural question. It is\ndeciding whether the persecution was on the basis of a\nprotected class, those sorts of considerations, which\nare not the same question as: Is this person likely to\nbe killed if they are returned?\nThat's why -- that's why the -- this Court\nhas held that unless Congress demonstrates very clearly\nthat it intends to take away the court's ability to\nconsider the equities, that we don't interpret\nCongress's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Excuse me, but I'm not\nfollowing. I have the same difficulty that perhaps the\nChief Justice is trying to get at. In the case where it\nappears to the -- the judge that the -- that the alien\nwould be murdered when he is returned, wouldn't his\ndeportation be prohibited by law?\nMS. HARRISON: Well, not always, Your Honor,\nif the question that the court was considering wasn't\nwhether in fact the individual was going to be killed if\nreturned. If the question the court is considering is\nwhether -- whether a crime he has committed subjects the\nindividual to deportation, then the fact that that\nindividual is going to be killed when he is returned to\nthe country is not part of the (f)(2) calculus.\nAnd -- and I don't believe that the\ngovernment has -- has argued that the equities would be\npart of the consideration. The government has argued\nthat for legal -- for factual questions you need to\nprove them by clear and convincing evidence, and for\nlegal questions you need to prove you are entitled to a\njudgment as a matter of law.\nWhere the equities fall into that calculus\nis -- is unclear, and I think they would only fall under\nthat calculus if the very question presented to the\ncourt was that one. And -- and then, moreover, when you\nsay --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say \"equities,\"\nis the fact that he has applied or his wife has applied\nfor adjustment of his status, is that an equity?\nMS. HARRISON: No, Your Honor, I don't\nbelieve that that itself would be an equity. But the\nfact that he does have a wife and he does have a young\nchild in this country would be a permissible\nconsideration in the equitable analysis, in the analysis\nof -- of irreparable harm that would come to him and his\nfamily. The -- the basis for his motion to reopen was\nnot the denial of adjustment -- of his adjustment of\nstatus.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was changing\nconditions.\nMS. HARRISON: That's right, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Alleged changing\nconditions.\nMS. HARRISON: Yes, Your Honor.\nAnd I also think that -- that it's important\nto emphasize this Court's clear-statement rule, which is\nthat the court doesn't take for -- lightly statutes that\ndo not very, very clearly take away the power of the\ncourts to grant the stay, to grant an injunction. And\nif it's not very clear from the face of the statute that\nthat is what Congress intended, that the court will not\ninterpret as having done so.\nI also think that it's important to\nemphasize that when Congress wanted to be expansive in\ngetting rid of forms of equitable relief, it was. In\n1252(e)(1)(A), for example, which if you would like to\nlook appears on page 11a of the appendix to the gray\nbrief, that's the provision where Congress limited the\nforms of equitable relief available to aliens facing\nremoval in expedited situations. And there Congress's\nlanguage was very clear that: No declaratory injunctive\nor other equitable relief. There is no language of that\nsort in (f)(2); the same with (f)(1).\nIn that provision Congress said no court in\n-- in a class situation can enjoin or restrain the\nremoval of an alien. Not in (f)(2). In (f)(2) Congress\nonly used the word \"enjoin\" in its omission of other\nequitable relief, and its omission of restrain are\ninstructive.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think\nreferences to equitable relief and restrain are clear\nenough to cover the Court's authority to grant a stay?\nMS. HARRISON: I don't believe that restrain\nis, Your Honor, because I think restrain -- it's unclear\nwhether Congress is talking about a stay versus a\ntemporary injunction or a restraining order. I think\nother equitable relief does capture stays, because we\ndon't deny that a stay is a form of equitable relief.\nIt's simply not an injunction, because it's not directed\nat a party, and it doesn't order a party to do\nsomething.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just to refresh my\nrecollection, what -- what is the major difference\nbetween the standards that -- or the findings that the\njudge must make, (a) to grant a preliminary injunction\nand (b) to grant a stay?\nMS. HARRISON: That has to be the same, Your\nHonor, in the usual situation, because both arise at the\nsame stage in the proceedings where it makes sense that\nthe court would want to consider: What is the\nlikelihood that this person is going to succeed down the\nroad? What -- what is the risk if I don't grant relief\nat this stage?\nBut those two things are also treated\ndifferently in the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure\nin Rule 8 and also Rule 18, which governs only stays of\nagency orders and not injunctions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My -- my concern is that I\nsense in this statute a congressional concern that stays\nare too frequently granted. And one thing we could do,\nif we were to accept your view of the statute, is to\nsay: And you must be very careful.\nWell, the courts don't listen to that very\nmuch. And short of granting the -- accepting the\ngovernment's position, I don't know what you could do if\nthere were a -- a submission and understanding that\nstays were being granted routinely and too frequently.\nMS. HARRISON: Well, Your Honor, the -- the\nstandard that Congress intended, the traditional one, is\nnot a standard under which stays are -- are routinely\ngranted. They -- they have been denied in some of the\nvery cases where the circuits decided whether (f)(2)\napplies or -- or whether the traditional standard\napplies.\nAnd this Court has given guidance, for\nexample, this term in Winter, that you have to -- not to\nshow some likelihood of -- of suffering or irreparable\nharm, but you have to show a strong probability of\nsuccess on the merits, and you have to show a strong\nprobability of irreparable harm. And so if down the\nroad it seems that courts are not faithfully\nimplementing that standard, then the Court could again\nprovide guidance to that effect. But I don't think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That case -- this case\ncould come out the same. If we remand and we say that\nit's the traditional standards, this case might well\ncome out the same way. The -- the court might say,\nwell, it doesn't make it under the traditional -- it\nhasn't shown a likelihood of success on the merits.\nMS. HARRISON: That's right, Your Honor.\nAnd -- and it very well could, and we feel we are\nentitled, obviously, to make that showing before the\nFourth Circuit and have the Fourth Circuit apply the\ntraditional test and make a decision under that test in\nthe first instance. But it is true that the State could\nbe denied, and that there is no guarantee. It is not\nautomatic.\nAnd that's why I think before '96 Congress\nused the same language for aggravated felons then that\nit does now for everyone. Because it knew that \"unless\na court otherwise directs\" doesn't mean automatic. It\nmeans that only where there -- there is a likelihood of\nsuccess and where the equities counsel in -- in favor of\nthe stay, it should be granted.\nThat's also how this Court interpreted that\nsimilar language in Hilton in interpreting Federal Rule\nof Appellate Procedure 239(c), which concerns a stay of\na grant of a writ of habeas corpus on appeal. This\nCourt said that the traditional stay standard should\napply in that situation interpreting virtually the same\nlanguage that Congress then chose to use in this\nprovision, (e)(3)(B).\nI would like to reserve the remainder of my\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nGeneral Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nGEN. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe statutory text, context and background\nof section 1252(f)(2) all demonstrate that that section\napplies to orders granting a stay of removal pending a\ncourt of appeals decision on a petition for review.\nIndeed, if section 1252(f)(2) does not apply to such an\norder barring removal, it is difficult to see what\nfunction it would serve.\nNow, Petitioner's counsel has suggested that\n1252(f)(2) must be directed to what I think had been\nreferred to as fluke kind of district court orders, and\ncouldn't really be directed at the situation that we\nhave here. There are two very powerful responses to\nthat, if I may make them both.\nThe first is that subsection (f)(2), which\nappear on page 14a of our brief refers, it says no court\nshall enjoin the removal, et cetera, under this section,\nmeaning that the provision is specifically directed to\ncourt orders that are entered as part of the proceedings\non judicial review of final orders under section 1252.\nIt's not -- it's not principally directed at collateral\norders that might arise in some other class action or\nsome other sort of suit.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Were the examples that she\ngives, the two or three cases, properly examples under\nthis section, in your --\nGEN. KNEEDLER: Well, I think there were two\ndifferent types of examples that she gave, if I may. I\nthink the first one was a situation where a Department\nof Homeland Security officer might have erroneously\ncarried out an order of removal not realizing that there\nwas a -- a stay entered.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I interrupt you just a\nsecond? When I meant examples, I meant the cited cases.\nThere were two or three cited cases.\nGEN. KNEEDLER: The -- the cited cases, we\ndon't think, are examples of this. (F)(2) was not at\nissue in those -- in those cases. The question in\nseveral of them was whether the separate provision\n1252(g), which this Court discussed in the American-Arab\ncase, whether that applied, and there was at least one\nother case, it involved the transitional rules under\nwhich (f)(2) doesn't apply.\nBut I think the more fundamental answer to\nyour point was the second point that I was -- that I was\ngoing to make. There are -- there are three provisions\nof section 1252 that make unmistakably clear that\nCongress did not intend any challenge to a final order\nof removal, any form of judicial review which would\ninclude an injunction to take place outside of 1252\nitself. And 1252(a)(1) provides the judicial review\nshall be pursuant to chapter 158 of -- and that's on\npage 1a of the brief -- shall be pursuant to chapter 158\nof title 28, the Hobbs Judicial Review Act.\nAnd then (a)(5), which is on page 4a of our\nbrief, says notwithstanding any other provision of law,\na petition for review filed with an appropriate court is\nthe sole and exclusive means for judicial review of the\nremoval order. Unless there be any doubt, the last\nsentence the in that section says for purposes of this\nentire chapter. Any time there is a reference to\njudicial review, it refers to any sort of statutory or\nnonstatutory provision.\nSo any time an alien would try to get an\ninjunction in any form of judicial review, Congress has\nexpressed barred it not only by this, but then also by\nsubsection (b)(9).\nJUSTICE BREYER: On that particular point,\njust specifically -- this is awfully complicated and you\nhave had to go through it pretty quickly, and so have I.\nAll right.\nSo, it seems to me, looking at these three\nsections, as soon as you get to (a)(2), it says certain\nmatter are not subject to judicial review, and it\nincludes 1225(b)(1), which I take it is the case where\nsomebody comes in, knocks at our door, and the\nimmigration judge says good-bye and he says, no, no, I\nam entitled to be a refugee or asylum.\nNow, we look at that, it says in there it's\nsubsection (e) gives you judicial review of that. Now we\nlook at the thing you cited which is (5) -- (a)(5), and\nyou read it completely correctly, but you left out these\nwords \"except as provided in subsection (e).\"\nSo now we go to subsection (e). And lo and\nbehold, what is subsection (e) talking about, but just\nthe case I have mentioned. It talks about -- it talks\nabout judicial review for orders under 1225(b)(1). Now,\nthose are the people who knock at the door and they want\nasylum. And there is some procedures for them.\nSo, now we look at (e) to see what are the\nprocedures for them. And lo and behold, right there in\n(2), it says you can have a habeas corpus procedure as\nto certain matters, whether he is an alien, whether he\nhas been admitted as a refugee, et cetera. So it says\nthere are some you can have habeas corpus.\nSo I imagine a person who has been ordered\nremoved under (e). All right. Now it says you can have\na habeas corpus and now the judge says good-bye. And\nthey go to a reviewing court, which is going to be a\nhabeas corpus court, and that court decides, the alien\nis right, I am going to issue an injunction.\nNow, just in case he's thinking that, in the\nvery next section (f), what we have are two provisions,\n(f)(1) that says if his case is a case involving mass\naction against the whole thing, you can't enter an\ninjunction.\nAnd then we look at (2), and it says if his\nis just a normal case, you can't enter an injunction\nunless it meets this specific standard. So I looked at\nthat. And I admit this is pretty quick, and I thought\nit's (e) and it's (f), and (f) is dealing with (e),\n(f)(2). And it makes perfect sense. They don't want a\nhabeas corpus judge telling that immigration judge what\nto do with the guy knocking on the door and saying \"I\nneed asylum,\" unless they meet clear and present\ndanger -- clear and -- whatever it is, clear and\npresent -- yeah.\nOkay. Now, I will admit I read that\nquickly. And therefore, I am probably missing something.\nAnd I don't expect you necessarily to be an expert, but\ncan you do your best to tell me what I am missing or if\nyou think I might be right?\nGEN. KNEEDLER: Yes, if I could. 1225(b)(1)\ngoverns the special -- what is called expedited removal.\nIt's a special procedure, as you identified, for people\nessentially knocking at the door, and it has very\nlimited review, as you suggested. Almost everything is\nunreviewable except possibility of asylum.\nBut it's -- that is the only provision for\ndistrict court review. It's the, shall we say,\nfunctional equivalent of a petition for review in the\ncourt of appeals and everybody else. Congress just\ndecided to have two different -- two separate\nprocedures, and I think for 1225(b)(1) it's really a\ncarryover orders of exclusion prior to 1996.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What it says here\nspecifically is it says habeas proceedings.\nGEN. KNEEDLER: Yes, it does -- it does\nsay -- it does say habeas, but (f) -- there is no\nsuggestion that (f), either (1), which is general\napplication, or (f)(2) in particular is limited to\nsubsection (e). It -- it speaks of any injunction.\nAnd that is instructive because the term\n\"injunction\" is used in the Hobbs Judicial Review Act to\ndescribe an interlocutory order by a court of appeals on\njudicial review that suspends the enforcement of an\nagency order pending judicial review. And we quote the\nHobbs Judicial Review Act in our brief.\nAnd as I mentioned before, that is very\nimportant to understand here, because Congress\nprovided -- other than the habeas review for this\nspecial category, Justice Breyer, Congress provided that\njudicial review in the norm is in the court of appeals\npursuant to the Hobbs Act. And if you look at the Hobbs\nAct provision for interlocutory stays, it refers to\ninterlocutory relief as an injunction. It uses the\nword --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, let me add one other\nthing, because all I am trying to do is find some work\nfor this section (f)(2) to do. And I think I found\nsome. And I think what you say is wait a minute, we\nagree it's like habeas. But and I think it would be\nlike an exclusion order rather than a removal order.\nAnd I did notice previously when it talks\nabout 1225, sometimes it uses the word \"exclusion\" and\nsometimes it says \"removal.\" But if you were that\ndistrict habeas judge and you get a thing saying\nremoval, you don't really vacate it. I think what you\nhad do is order an injunction against its enforcement.\nHere I don't know --\nGEN. KNEEDLER: I think the habeas court\nwould have the authority -- would have the authority to\nvacate just as -- just as a court of appeals would have\nthe authority to vacate.\nBut my basic point is that both of them are\nforms of judicial review. And if this heightened\ninjunction standard applies to the form of judicial\nreview that Congress has decided to leave in habeas,\nthen there is no reason to imagine why Congress wouldn't\nwant the same injunctive standard to apply to somebody\nwho is seeking judicial review in the normal way, in the\ncourt of appeals, especially since Congress used the\nword \"injunction\" to describe this very sort of\ninterlocutory relief under the Hobbs Judicial Review Act\nwhen -- when a person seeks judicial review in a -- in a\ncourt of appeals.\nAnd this conforms to the ordinary meaning of\nthe word which is \"enjoin,\" which is to prohibited\nsomething, to require a party to abstain from carrying\nout an act. That's exactly what a stay of removal does.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- do you\nagree with your friend that the basic difference between\nyour two positions is that under the stay factors you\nare allowed to consider irreparable harm but are not\nallowed to consider that under (f)(2).\nGEN. KNEEDLER: No, I think (f)(2) -- (f)(2)\nis -- is a necessary condition for granting relief. It\ndoesn't -- it doesn't eliminate the requirement that an\nalien show -- show harm from the -- from the removal.\nIt's -- it's a condition --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What difference would it\nmake? I mean, if he can satisfy the clear and\nconvincing standard, which is tantamount to saying that\non final judgment I win, hands down, what need is there\nto -- to go into irreparable harm?\nGEN. KNEEDLER: And that -- and that -- that\n-- that may well be. I think it may well be in the\ntypical case. If I -- if I could just --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but -- but that's --\nno, but in any case, if he's got to show by clear and\nconvincing evidence that he is going to have success on\nthe merits, I don't see any point in any case of going\ninto irreparable harm. If he goes into irreparable harm\nwithout the clear and convincing standard, he loses. If\nhe satisfies the clear and convincing standard, there is\nnothing for irreparable harm considerations to -- to add\nto -- to the mix of factors.\nGEN. KNEEDLER: Well, as we understand the\nreference to clear and convincing evidence, and\nadmittedly it's not entirely clear how Congress intended\nthat standard to apply in this context. As we\nunderstand it it is -- it is a standard of review\nslightly more favorable to the alien than the\nsubstantial evidence review standard, which is what\nwould apply -- one final --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's certainly more than a\npreponderance?\nGEN. KNEEDLER: Yes. But -- but in no\nevent, even on review of the final order, is the court\nreviewing for a preponderance of the evidence; the court\nis reviewing the case on the administrative record under\nthe substantial evidence test, in which case the court\nat final judgment cannot set aside the -- the agency\norder, except -- unless it finds that no reasonable\nfactfinder could conclude that the order should stand.\nThat's the substantial evidence test.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the ultimate -- the\nultimate standard to which they look is a preponderance\nstandard. In other words, the substantial evidence\nstandard is keyed to what a reasonable factfinder could\nfind reasonably, based upon substantial evidence. Is\nthe substantial evidence sufficient for such a\nfactfinder to find by a preponderance that this person\nhas failed to meet, or, put it the other way around,\nthat the factfinder has unreasonably failed to find that\nthe Petitioner has met the standard?\nSo ultimately you are talking about a\npreponderance standard, which is -- which is the key,\nisn't that correct?\nGEN. KNEEDLER: That -- that is -- the court\n-- you are correct in the sense that the court is\nreviewing to see whether substantial evidence supports\nthe IJ's determination by a preponderance of the\nevidence. But (f)(2) is written in terms of the sort of\nshowing that the alien must make to the court, and --\nand not -- not what he would have made to the IJ. And\nas -- and as we read it, as we try to apply the language\nin the context of a stay, we thing that means that the\nalien must show something a little bit short of -- of\nthe substantial evidence, that no reasonable factfinder\ncould find it, at least clear and convincing evidence\nthat as -- that the IJ was incorrect or that the alien\nhas a successful case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there other cases in\nwhich clear and convincing -- the clear and convincing\nstandard applies to appellate courts? It seems to me\nclear and convincing is more appropriate for a factual\ndetermination at the trial court level.\nGEN. KNEEDLER: It -- it -- it ordinarily\nis. And that --and that's why the phrasing, as I was\ntrying to discuss with Justice Souter, I think, is a\nlittle awkward. Another possible way to think about it,\nand this may be what Congress was really driving at,\nwhen it was -- when it was saying clear and convincing\nevidence, it really meant a clear and convincing\nshowing; that the -- that the courts shouldn't take this\ntoo casually.\nAs we point out in our brief, the Second\nCircuit has a standard that the alien just has to show\nmore than a negligible likelihood of success on the\nmerits to prevail. Well, that -- that's way below what\neven the traditional standard would be. So it's\npossible to read clear and convincing evidence as really\ndriving at clear and convincing showing, which is\nlanguage that is -- that is somewhat reminiscent of what\nthis Court has said for preliminary injunctions\ngenerally.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I take it at\nleast in the Seventh Circuit these things are usually\ngranted?\nGEN. KNEEDLER: They're -- uh -- we do not\nhave empirical data, and I wish we did, on the\npercentage, but they are -- in the Ninth Circuit in our\nexperience -- again we don't have percentages, but they\nare granted quite frequently.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the standard is\nprobable success on the merits, and that's not an easy\nstandard. Irreparable harm and probable success on the\nmerits, both.\nGEN. KNEEDLER: Well, if -- if the courts\nactually applied that standard, there would at least be\nsome improvement in the stay standards, but the courts\nsometimes apply a sliding scale, where they say if there\nis -- you know, a serious question and a showing -- a\nshowing of substantial harm would be sufficient. Well,\nthis Court has twice reaffirmed in the last term, in the\nlast term --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What are we supposed to do?\nWhat would you had do? Suppose you are a district court\njudge and at 2:00 in the afternoon on Friday a petition\ncomes in and it's from someone who says, \"I'm going to\nbe on the 5:00 airplane to Hong Kong and I have a real\ncase here. I think I am right.\" And he has eight pages\nattached and you read through that. And you say, \"He\nhas a point. Now how good this point is, I don't know.\nSo I would like to put this -- I would like to have\neverybody in here on Monday, and then I could figure it\nout.\"\nNow, that probably happens. Now what is\nworrying me about your position on this -- which,\nalthough most -- I think every circuit is against you on\nthis, except for this one.\nGEN. KNEEDLER: And there are others.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it seems to me that\nwould make it impossible for the district judge to do,\nbecause the district judge cannot honestly say that it's\nclear and convincing that this man is going to win. All\nhe knows is he has a point and he would like to hear\nmore about it and he doesn't want him on the airplane\nthree hours from now from Hong Kong. So I -- so how is\nit supposed to work?\nGEN. KNEEDLER: Well, it would be the court\nof appeals, not the district judge.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right.\nGEN. KNEEDLER: But it -- we believe that\nthat -- that 1252(f)(2) allows a court to take the time\nnecessary to rule meaningfully on the stay application.\nWe do not believe Congress intended to divest the court\nof the ability to rule on the merits. It has a\nsubstantive standard that the alien has to make a clear\nand convincing -- has to show by clear and convincing\nevidence. It presupposes that the alien has to make a\nshowing; therefore it presupposes that the court must be\nable to evaluate that showing. We also believe that it\npresupposes that the government is permitted to respond\nto it.\nSo we -- we do not object and have not\nobjected in the lower courts to the courts taking\nsufficient time to -- to freeze the status quo by\nissuing a short stay if necessary to do that.\nNow, in the Eleventh Circuit, for example,\nwhich has operated under this heightened showing for\nsome period of time, it tends to work out, because when\na -- a -- a petition for review and stay application is\ngranted, the court contacts the Office of Immigration\nLitigation which works with DHS to inform the court on\nhow soon the order might be issued, and then the court's\naware of how quickly it might act.\nSo -- so it wouldn't often be necessary for\nthe court to do it, but we did not challenge that\nauthority.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But and -- and I applaud\nthe fact that you don't, but I don't know how you can do\nit consistently with your view that \"stay\" in (b)(3)(B)\nmeans the same thing as the \"injunction\" in (f) when\n\"injunction\" in (f) is restricted as much as it is.\nGEN. KNEEDLER: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: God bless you, but I don't\nknow how -- I don't know how under the statute, on your\nreading of the statute, you -- you can do it.\nGEN. KNEEDLER: There are two responses.\nOne, we -- we think it is necessarily implicit in the\nstatutory framework that Congress would have wanted the\ncourt to be able to rule on the interlocutory\ninjunction, but the -- but the second point I think that\n-- that reinforces this proposition, again, if you go\nback to the Hobbs Judicial Review Act, it has a\nprovision not only for interlocutory injunctions, which\nis what we're really talking about here, but a provision\nfor a temporary -- for a court to issue a temporary stay\nupon a showing of irreparable injury to allow the status\nquo to be maintained pending the court's ruling on the\ninterlocutory injunction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Then why\ndoesn't that provide the broader authority under\n(b)(3)(B) stay provision that your friends on the other\nside are arguing for?\nGEN. KNEEDLER: Well, it may -- that may\nwell be the right answer, is to read (b)(3)(B) --\n(b)(3)(B)'s opening that -- which says a petition for\nreview does not in itself stay the order -- is very\nsimilar to the language in the opening of 2349(b) which\nis the interlocutory injunctive language of the Hobbs\nJudicial Review Act. It says the mere filing of the\npetition doesn't stay or suspend the order. It says\nstay or suspend the order, and it says stay, and then it\nsays but a court may -- I forget the precise language --\nrestrain or suspend the order reflecting pending\njudicial review; and it refers to that as an\ninterlocutory injunction.\nBut it says if the Petitioner shows that\nirreparable injury would occur before the court has a\nchance to rule even on the interlocutory injunction, it\ncan issue what's called a temporary stay to maintain the\nstatus quo until it can look at the -- at the -- at the\ninterim relief.\nWell, if -- if that -- if that background\nrule is not misplaced, that would allow for some\nseparation of the sort of emergency motion for a stay, a\nhold fast sort of situation, for the court to be able to\nevaluate the merits. But when it gets to what the Hobbs\nAct refers to as an injunction, then (f)(2) kicks in,\ninterlocutory injunction pending -- pending judicial\nreview.\nSo that would be -- that would be an\nunderlying statutory basis for allowing the court to --\nto issue a temporary order to allow the -- to allow the\nproceeding to go forward, but we think it should be done\nin a timely way. The Hobbs Judicial Review Act\ncontemplates a rather casual, up to 60 days that such a\ntemporary stay should remain in effect. We think in\nmany cases under the immigration laws the court should\nbe able to act on the stay application more quickly than\nthat.\nI did want -- I did also want to stress the\n-- the policy purposes that Justice Kennedy raised in --\nin an earlier question, and that is the -- the thrust-\nthe whole thrust of the 1996 amendments to the\nImmigration Act was to expedite the removal of aliens,\nparticularly criminal aliens, but not all -- but all\naliens in fact. And Congress did several things when it\ndid that. It repealed the prior provision where that\nsaid the mere filing of petition for review\nautomatically stayed the removal unless the courts\nordered -- ordered otherwise. And it also repealed the\nprior provision that said that the alien -- if the alien\nleft the country, including -- that was construed to\nmean pursuant to deportation order, he could no longer\nchallenge the removal order outside the country.\nCongress changed completely that and it said\nyou had can now challenge the order of removal from\noutside the country, and it basically reversed the\npresumption with respect to whether - whether the filing\nof the petition for review stays -- stays the order of\nremoval. Congress said, No, it does not unless the\ncourts ordered otherwise.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you would expect the\nstandard to be in the (b)(3)(B) provision. It says that\nno automatic stay unless the court otherwise orders,\nperiod. That's the end of it.\nSo one wonders whether this would think that\nthe normal standard for a stay would apply. And then\n(f)(2) is separated by several pages and (f)(1) is\ndealing with something where we understand it. It says\nno mass injunctions against the enforcement of a\nprovision. But (2) is really puzzling what it relates\nto, is it supposed to have some relationship to (1)? 1\nsays you can't enjoin the enforcement of a provision of\nthe law.\nGEN. KNEEDLER: Well, (f)(1) is directed at\n-- in large part at programmatic challenges. It\nprovides -- it prohibits courts from enjoining or\nrestraining the operation of part 4 of the INA which --\nwhich is the provision that deals with deportation,\nadjudication of deportation and exclusions and carrying\nout those orders, which by the way we think is the\nreason it says enjoin or restrain, because it's talking\nabout programmatic type actions, and restrain -- the\nword restraint is sometimes used to be something in an\nabsolute prohibition, just -- just to limit it, whereas\non \"enjoin\" is necessary under (f)(2) because it --\nbecause what is being enjoined or stayed is a vary\ndiscreet act. You can have an injunction barring\nremoval or -- or you don't.\nBut I -- I think a further answer to your\nquestion, Justice Ginsburg, is that (f)(2) says under\nthis section, which means that it is obviously referring\nto court orders entered in the course of -- of removal\nproceedings under section 1252, and when a court finally\ngets to the merits in a petition for review in a court\nof appeals, the court if it decides that there is a flaw\n-- excuse me -- a legal flaw in the BIA or immigration\njudge's decision, it vacates the decision and -- and --\nand remands.\nInjunctions are not necessary in that -- in\nthat kind of review, so-\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So in this -- in\nthis case involving a denial of a motion to reopen, what\nthe court of appeals is supposed to do is to look ahead\nand see if this person has shown by clear and convincing\nevidence that they shouldn't be removed; and if they\nhaven't, then their -- their removal can't be blocked,\neven for example if the court of appeals thinks, well,\nyes, they should have gotten their motion to reopen.\nGEN. KNEEDLER: No, no. The way -- the way\nI would understand it to operate is that the -- the\nalien would have to make a clear and convincing showing\nthat he is entitled to have the motion to reopen\ngranted. Because if the motion to reopen is granted,\nthat vacates the final order of removal and therefore\nthere is no longer a final order of removal pursuant to\nwhich the alien could be removed.\nAnd I did want to respond to your suggestion\nthat maybe the standard should be more lenient with\nrespect to motions to reopen. With respect, I think\nthat's the opposite of what the rule should be, if\nanything; because the final -- the review of the final\norder of removal is the main show; and in that -- in\nthat situation, the alien is actually challenging the\norder of removal.\nIn a case like this where the order of\nremoval was a long time ago, and the -- and the -- the\nalien sought judicial review of that and that was\ndenied, the only thing before the court is the -- is the\nmotion to reopen. And staying -- a judicial order\nstaying the denial of a motion to reopen is meaningless.\nIn order to get the relief preventing removal you need a\nstay of removal, which really effectively directs DHS-\nas we think it does in all cases -- directs DHS not to\nexecute the order of removal that was -- t hat was\nalready previously entered.\nAnd also the denial of a motion to reopen,\nespecially like the one at issue in this case, where the\nquestion is whether the alien has shown -- has produced\nmaterial evidence of changed circumstances, that is\nreviewed as this Court said in its decision in Abudu,\nunder an abuse of discretion standard. So it would be\nvery likely -- very unlike that an alien would prevail.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This provision\napplies to us as well, I take it, right?\nGEN. KNEEDLER: Yes, we -- we believe it\nwould.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if there is a\ncert petition filed on behalf of an alien subject to\nremoval, and he asks for a stay of removal, we have to\ndecide whether he meets the clear and convincing\nevidence standard.\nGEN. KNEEDLER: For -- for purposes of\ngranting a stay, yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We should have -- we\nshould have done this in this case, but I assume you\nsuspended removal of the Petitioner on your own?\nGEN. KNEEDLER: Well, the Court granted the\nstay in connection with the -- with the granting of --\nof certiorari in my case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask just a\ntechnical point?\nGEN. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One of the -- the motion\nto reopen was based on changed circumstances in the\nCameroon. But there was also this independent\napplication for adjustment of his status, which was\nturned down because it was a successive motion.\nGEN. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: My understanding is that\nthat adjustment could not have been asked for earlier\nbecause his wife didn't come with -- until after.\nGEN. KNEEDLER: If I -- yes. Well, he -- he\ndid seek -- he did seek, the first time around he sought\na remand for consideration of his adjustment of status\napplication, but one of the requirements to be eligible\nfor that is that a visa be available, and a visa was not\nthen available, and nothing in the Act requires that\ndeportation hearings be held up until a visa becomes\navailable.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but now he would\nqualify, except that it's a successive motion. So it\nseems earlier he was premature and now he's too late.\nGEN. KNEEDLER: But -- but Congress was\nquite explicit; it only wanted one -- one motion to\nreopen, except in the case of asylum or withholding of\ndeportation. It wanted -- it wanted the proceedings to\ncome to an end. And that's -- the circumstances of this\ncase powerfully reinforce what Congress --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just ask a\nquestion?\nGEN. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This person is married to\na citizen, has an American citizen child. Is there any\nway that his status could be adjusted? It can't in this\nprocedural situation because it is a successive motion.\nGEN. KNEEDLER: He could -- he could apply\nfor an immigrant visa from abroad. Now there may be\nsituations in which -- in which by virtue of having been\nremoved, there is a bar to his getting that, but that is\nsubject to waiver. So really what the alien's\nadjustment status in the United States is discretionary\nif there is a piece of available -- it is discretionary\nfrom abroad. All -- it's really a alternate venue\nprovision, where the alien applies from abroad.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: GEN. KNEEDLER, when we\nentered this stage, did we violate (f)(2)?\nGEN. KNEEDLER: I -- I think it would be\nanalogous to what I was saying before, that the -- this\nCourt like a court of appeals has the authority to -- to\nfreeze the status quo while it can decide the pertinent\nlegal issue, and the pertinent legal issue before\nthis --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Where -- where do we get\nthat authority if (f)(2) means what you say?\nGEN. KNEEDLER: Well, as I explained, we do\nnot -- we do not challenge the ability of a court to\ndecided -- to freeze the status quo while ruling on the\nmotion for stay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what court would ever\ndo anything else? I mean, why if you were granting a\nstay, would you not want to do that so you can fully\nconsider the issues?\nGEN. KNEEDLER: Well, but there's -- it's\nnot two stages; it's three. The -- a stay of removal\nis, under the Hobbs Act terms, an interlocutory\ninjunction. That can last -- judicial review in the\nNinth Circuit can last four years, so if a stay is\ngranted, you could have an interlocutory injunction in\nplace for a long time. The temporary stay is just while\nthe court is ruling, considering the interlocutory\ninjunction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But this is a longer\ntemporary stay than you conceded a few moments ago. I\nmean, you were talking about Friday night to Monday\nmorning, when you were -- when you were conceding the\nstay on the Hobbs analogy. I don't know how many months\nit's been, but this is no Friday night to Monday morning\nstay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's pretty close to\nit, though.\n(Laughter.)\nGEN. KNEEDLER: It feels like it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General\nKneedler.\nMs. Harrison, you have seven minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LINDSAY C. HARRISON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. HARRISON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI'd like to start with the point that the\ngovernment contends that this Court or any court of\nappeals could impose a stay to consider the stay motion.\nAnd, respectfully, I don't believe that is consistent\nwith the text of (f)(2), and I think that the fact that\nthe government must stray from the text is a sign of how\nabsurd the results would be if (f)(2) were applied to\nstays.\nNow, the reason they must stray from the\ntext is that the text says \"notwithstanding any other\nprovision of law,\" which means notwithstanding the Hobbs\nAct and notwithstanding the All Risk Act, which is where\nI believe my brother was indicating this Court would get\nauthority to impose such a stay.\nNow, I think the fact that there are cases\nwhere such a need would arise, as in Justice Breyer's\nhypothetical, is exactly why this Court applies a\npresumption against interpreting statutes as restricting\nthe equitable authority of the courts, unless there is a\nclear statement to the contrary, which --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but you still have a\ndifferential on the Friday to Monday night hypothetical.\nYou wouldn't apply, or would you, the same standard that\nyou would apply on Monday for the next -- on Monday for\nthe next year and a half?\nMS. HARRISON: Well, Your Honor, the (f)(2)\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because you have the same\nproblem under your standard as the government does under\nits.\nMS. HARRISON: Well, that's true. You'd\nhave to show likelihood of success. But in -- in the\nsituation where you could consider the equities, if the\nequities were strong enough and demonstrated in the stay\napplication, then it wouldn't be difficult for the court\nto decide whether the balance of the factors justified\nimplementing a stay in that situation. Under (f)(2),\nthe court would have to decide the question outright.\nAnd, again, (f)(2) does not mean any predictive\nlanguage; it just says, has the individual demonstrated\nand shown by clear and convincing evidence that removal\nis prohibited by law? Under the traditional standard,\nthere is a -- the court is allowed to consider whether\nthe individual is likely to show success on the merits.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You think that if you do\nnot prevail, and we say clear and convincing evidence is\nthe standard, that courts are not entitled to consider\nequity?\nMS. HARRISON: Well, Your Honor, I heard my\nbrother as indicating that if you meet the (f)(2)\nstandard, then -- then the court can consider the\nequities so as to deprive the individual of the stay,\nbut that if you cannot meet the (f)(2) standard, then\nthe question is closed and there is no consideration.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: About your position, is it\nyour contention that if we grant -- if we determine\nclear and convincing is the standard, that equities are\nnot relevant to that calculus?\nMS. HARRISON: Yes, Your Honor, in the event\nthat the individual does not meet (f)(2). If the\nindividual meets (f)(2), then I do believe the court\nwould go on to consider the equities. But in the event\nthat the individual has met the (f)(2) standard, the\ncourt could simply grant the petition on the merits, and\nthere is no need to go about considering the equities\nbecause the individual has shown that -- by clear and\nconvincing evidence -- that removal is prohibited as a\nmatter of law.\nAnd that is the second point I want to get\nto, which is Your Honor's question about, isn't this a\nstandard that sounds a lot more like it is directed at\ndistrict courts because -- I think you are right, Your\nHonor, and I think it does sound like that standard\nbecause I so think that was where it was intended to\napply. And the phrase \"under this section\" does not\nmodify the word \"enjoin\"; it modifies the word \"final\norder of removal.\" And to ascribe the government's\nreading to it would require you to move that phrase from\nwhere Congress placed it in the statute, to after the\nword \"enjoin.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess General\nKneedler's point is that clear and convincing shifts a\nlittle, depending on how long you've got to look at it.\nIf you've only got a day or a few hours before the\nremoval is going to take place, you can say this is\nconvincing enough based on what I have had a chance to\nlook at. But -- and therefore you could enter, I guess,\nwhat may be called the temporary stay to get more\nbriefing from the government or whatever. But you may\nfind out when you look at it a little more deeply that\nit's not clear and convincing. What's wrong with that?\nMS. HARRISON: Well, Your Honor, if the\nCourt were to interpret clear and convincing as a more\nflexible standard, then I don't think -- you know, I\ndon't disagree with Your Honor's characterization of it.\nBut I still think that, regardless of how you interpret\nclear and convincing, that the equities would not be\npart of the calculus.\nAnd I also think that the fact that clear\nand convincing sounds like a standard Congress would\nhave addressed to district courts, the fact that (f)(2)\nsays \"no\" courts, not -- not just the \"courts of\nappeals,\" the fact that it references an \"alien\" and not\na \"petitioner\" are -- and the fact that it is addressed\nto instances where the entry or execution is prohibited\nby law as opposed to the order itself being unlawful are\nall signs that Congress intended this provision to apply\nboth in the district courts and in the court of appeals.\nAnd I would also note that (a)(5), which is\na provision the government pointed to, was not in the\n1996 statute it was added in 2005, and the\nconstitutionality of that provision continues to be\nlitigated. And, moreover, there are habeas cases in the\ndistrict courts that persist where (f)(2) has real\napplication and where Congress's intent that an\ninjunction, not a stay, but an injunction be very\ndifficult to obtain --\nJUSTICE BREYER: 1225?\nMS. HARRISON: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was I right or wrong?\nMS. HARRISON: I believe you are right, and\nI believe that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are you sure? Because --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- you didn't mention it.\nIf I am right, why didn't you mention it?\nMS. HARRISON: I did not mention it in my\nopening, Your Honor, and that was my error. I believe\nhabeas is one example -- and habeas in the expedited\nremoval context, where the provisions would apply. And\n-- and I think, as this court made clear in Saint Cyr,\nCongress did intend for some habeas actions to persist\nin the '96 IIRIRA statute. And in those cases, (f)(2)\nwould apply, would have real impact.\nAnd I would also note that if the Court were\nto accept the government's interpretation of the term\n\"enjoin,\" that it only applies in stays and that doesn't\nhave application elsewhere, then you would be required\nto interpret Congress's use of the word \"enjoin\" to be\nnot really inclusive of stays but as coterminous with\nthe word \"stay.\" But Congress didn't use the word\n\"stay\" it (f)(2). It used the word \"enjoin.\" And the\nfact that that word choice was different from the word\nit used in (b)(3)(B) I think is a clear indication that\nCongress had something different. It didn't\ncross-reference stay and didn't use the word \"stays,\"\nand it articulated a standard that seems more\nappropriate for district courts adjudicating permanent\ninjunctive relief than courts of appeals hearing a\ntemporary application for a stay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the standard you\nthink should apply under (b)(3)(B) is a standard that\ndescribes as applicable to temporary injunctions. The\nword -- there is substantial likelihood of success on\nthe merits and irreparable harm -- that is the standard\npreliminary injunction, not preliminary stay. The\npreliminary injunction standard. So the two words\ncertainly overlap.\nMS. HARRISON: Yes, Your Honor. There is\noverlap, and the standard that is applied by the courts,\nif there is no statute to the contrary, is the same.\nBut here Congress expressed an intention to treat\ninjunctive relief differently and articulated a standard\nthat was higher than injunctive relief.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask this one\nreal quick: Do you understand -- is your understanding\nthat the government's interpretation of the statute that\nour stay in this case violated the statute?\nMS. HARRISON: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nHarrison.\nGeneral Kneedler, Ms. Harrison, the Court\nentered a very expedited briefing and arguments schedule\nin this case that unfortunately fell over the holiday\nseason, and we appreciate very much that this must have\nimposed a burden on you had and your colleagues. Thank\nyou.\n"
