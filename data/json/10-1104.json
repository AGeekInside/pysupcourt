        "content": "(11:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 10-1104, Minneci v. Pollard.\nMr. Franklin.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FRANKLIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nOver the last three decades, the Court has\nmade clear that Bivens remedies are disfavored and will\nonly be authorized in narrow situations where there are\nno adequate alternative means for redressing a\nplaintiff's injuries and no other factor counsels\nhesitation. Respondent has satisfied neither criterion.\nHe has not shown that he lacked a traditional tort\nremedy for the injuries of which he complains, and\nPetitioners' status as employees of a private\ncontractor, rather than the government, at a minimum\ngives rise to factors counseling hesitation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We go back to what you\nsaid initially; that is, if there's no alternative\nremedy, Bivens fills the gap.\nSuppose we had a case just like Carlson,\nonly the State law allows survivor actions. In Carlson,\nI thought the rule emerging from Carlson is that prison\npersonnel in Federal prisons are subject to Bivens\nliability, and we don't look in each case to see whether\nthere could have been a State tort.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, the rule --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that so?\nMR. FRANKLIN: In -- the rule -- the Carlson\nrule still applies, Your Honor, because that involved\nactual Federal Government employees. And since Carlson,\nCongress has pre-empted all tort claims against them.\nSo, whether Indiana law now -- which has been amended,\nbut whether Indiana law provides a remedy or doesn't is\nimmaterial, because Congress has pre-empted all tort\nclaims against actual employees of the government.\nBut these -- this case involves -- the\nPetitioners are not employees of the government. They\nare employees of a private contractor. And under the\nWestfall Act, what Congress did was pre-empt all claims\nagainst actual government officials while preserving\nBivens remedies.\nBut it did the opposite for employees of\nprivate contractors. For them, there are adequate\nalternative tort remedies. And it's virtually\nundisputed in this case that there was such a remedy\nhere. And they are deliberately -- Congress expressly\nexcluded them from the category of employees against\nwhom it preserved Bivens remedies.\nSo, yes, in the Carlson situation, there is\nstill a Bivens claim because Congress has expressly\npreserved that. But here we have a different\ncongressional policy that we are, in effect, asking the\nCourt to embrace here.\nWhat Congress did in the Westfall Act is it\nsaid what in effect we are asking this Court to\nrecognize and what we believe the Court has recognized\nin cases like Malesko, and that is, where there are\nadequate alternative tort -- excuse me -- where there\nare no adequate --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose, Mr. Franklin,\nthat there weren't. I mean, I think you have a good\ncase about California law here. But suppose we were in\na State where the law was very different from what\nCalifornia's law appears to be, where there was no\nspecial duty recognized for jailors and, indeed, where\nthe basic negligence tort was unavailable to inmates\nbecause there was a finding of -- a holding of the State\nsupreme court that there was no duty on the part of\njailors to inmates. What would happen then?\nMR. FRANKLIN: In that hypothetical instance\n-- and we do think it's hypothetical -- we think that\nwould be a different case, and the Court could in that\ncircumstance say there are no adequate alternative\nremedies. But the reason we think it's entirely\nhypothetical is there has nothing been shown in the\nbriefing of this Court, and as the Ninth Circuit\ndissenters made clear, that any State doesn't afford the\nbedrock cause of negligence. And that cause, as the\nCourt held in Malesko quite expressly, is not only\nadequate to redress any actions that would violate the\nEighth Amendment, but it's actually superior.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But is your answer --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Franklin, there were\nsome references to Mississippi law that seem to be\ninconsistent with the notion that all States would\nprovide an adequate remedy.\nMR. FRANKLIN: I believe that reference, if\nI'm correct, comes from an amicus brief, and that law\ndoes not -- would not on its face prohibit an action\nagainst a private managed prison holding Federal\nprisoners. These laws -- and the Mississippi law is an\nexample; there's a New York law. Those apply to State\ngovernment officials. They're similar to the Westfall\nAct, but on a State level. They immunize State\ngovernment officials from claims, but those claims would\nbe subject to 1983 actions. Here we have a privately\nmanaged prison holding Federal prisoners.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- and it might\nhold State prisoners as well.\nMR. FRANKLIN: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It might hold -- some\nprivate facilities will take State prisoners as well as\nFederal prisoners.\nMR. FRANKLIN: There has been some\nrepresentation, that we don't disagree with, that there\nmight be some facilities that have State prisoners\nand --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And if they do have State\nprisoners, the State prisoner would have recourse to,\nnot Bivens, but 1983.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Most likely, Your Honor, yes,\nif it's under --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you have two\nprisoners, identical mistreatment, and one gets a\nFederal remedy and the other doesn't.\nMR. FRANKLIN: The other actually gets what\nthe Court in Malesko described as a superior remedy.\nThe prisoner -- the Federal prisoner has, in that sense,\na remedy that's beyond the Eighth Amendment, that\ngoes --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me why it is\nthat you care in this suit? If you're telling us, oh,\ndon't worry, there's going to be liability and probably\nperhaps even more extensive liability than in Bivens,\nwhat difference does it make? Bivens doesn't give you\nattorneys' fees. Now, it's true that the Federal\nquestion may get you into Federal court.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, I have several answers\nto that. First, Your Honor, my clients care very deeply\nin this case because, as the district court held, if\nthere's no Bivens remedy, this case is dismissed. This\ncase was dismissed on the lack of a Bivens remedy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just because of the\nstatute of limitations?\nMR. FRANKLIN: It's way too late now, 10\nyears after the incident, for them to now assert State\nlaw claims. So, we do care. And, in fact, that was the\nsame situation that was in Malesko. In Malesko, you had\na virtually identical situation, where the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we're looking -- if\nwe're looking forward beyond this case --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and there's no statute\nof limitation problem, does it really make any\ndifference that he have this second cause of action\nthat's just --\nMR. FRANKLIN: It makes a --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- (a) duplicative or (b)\narguably narrow, more narrow?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, two points. I'd like\nto first say that the Court in Malesko adopted the\nprinciple that if there is an alternative remedy, that's\nnot a reason for piling on a Federal remedy; that's a\nreason not to. But in a practical sense --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But why? What --\nMR. FRANKLIN: I understand --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What difference does it\nmake?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Let me give you --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Who cares?\nMR. FRANKLIN: -- a practical difference that\ndoes matter for individuals in my clients' situation.\nIf a State tort claim is brought, there is respondeat\nsuperior liability under a State court claim. And in\nmany if not most cases, the plaintiff will choose,\nvoluntarily choose, to sue the corporation and leave the\nindividual out of the case.\nNow, the deterrent effect that Bivens is\nconcerned with still exists because the case can be\nbrought against the individual. However, if there's a\nBivens claim, that has to be brought against the\nindividual; it cannot be brought under respondeat\nsuperior. So, if there is a Bivens claim, as a\npractical matter you're going to see more and more\nindividuals being dragged through these cases without,\nby the way, the recognized qualified immunity defense --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Franklin --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- do you have a theory\nabout why these are brought as Bivens claims? It seems\nmysterious to me. If you bring it as a negligence\nclaim, you get a lower standard of liability, negligence\nversus deliberate indifference.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You get vicarious liability.\nSo, I've been trying to puzzle out, why aren't these\nbrought as negligence claims rather than as Bivens\nclaims?\nMR. FRANKLIN: I can't answer that question.\nWhat I can say -- well, I can try to answer it, but I\ncan say that if the Court rules as we ask it to in this\ncase, we think that there will not be Bivens claims,\nthat people will bring them under the tort law.\nIt could be that there are forms in some of\nthese prisons that are given out that have section 1983\nwritten on them, that Bivens is there. It could be that\nprisoners are not quite aware that the Westfall Act\ndoesn't cover private contractors.\nBut we would think that if the Court rules\nas we -- as we suggest it should, that there -- that the\nprisoners who are relatively savvy, even on a pro se\nbasis, about their rights would then understand that\nthey have these rights and will exercise them and that\nthe Bivens remedy would not have to be employed\nwilly-nilly as it was in this case. But I --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: To go back to what I asked\nbefore when I hypothesized a State that didn't have\nadequate remedies, and you said -- well, just to pin\ndown what you said, if there were no adequate remedies,\nthere would be a Bivens action available?\nMR. FRANKLIN: There might be, Your Honor.\nThere still is the factors counseling hesitation, which\nis the second step of the Bivens analysis. And I\nwouldn't want to give up that there might be factors in\nthose cases counseling hesitation. But certainly our\nposition is not that in a circumstance, if that arose --\nand, again, we think it's hypothetical because there's\nno indication either that it has arisen or that it will\narise -- but if it were to, our position wouldn't rule\nout the possibility of a Bivens claim in those\ncircumstances.\nJUSTICE ALITO: To get back to the question\nthat Justice Ginsburg asked, is it -- is that consistent\nwith Carlson? Because the Court in Carlson didn't say\nthat there's a Bivens action because in this particular\nState there isn't a viable State action, but it might be\ndifferent in another State where there is a viable State\nclaim. It did it on basically a categorical ground.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, it -- as the case came\nto the Court in Carlson, it was undisputed that there\nwas no adequate State law remedy, the lower courts had\nheld. So, that was sort of the basic premise that the\nCourt then went ahead and decided the case on.\nSince Carlson, we've had cases, notably\nMalesko, also Wilkie, which have made clear that the\nadequacy of remedies, including State law remedies, is a\nfactor in the Bivens analysis and is in fact the\ndispositive factor in Malesko, and as in this case as\nwell.\nWe don't think that there is really any\nserious dispute in this case that there were adequate\nalternative remedies. Again, the deliberate\nindifference standard is much, much more hard -- much\nharder to meet than a traditional negligence standard.\nCalifornia law is, further, more protective of\nprisoners.\nAs we understand the Respondents' position,\nthe Court -- they would urge the Court, notwithstanding\nthe availability of alternative remedies in this case\nand as far as we can tell in every foreseeable case, to\ncreate what they refer to as a categorical cause of\naction, one that would apply regardless of whether the\nremedies are adequate or not.\nAnd in our view, that would turn the Bivens\njurisprudence effectively on its head. The Court has\nsaid Bivens is a narrow -- I think Justice Ginsburg at\nleast paraphrased our argument as saying it's a\ngap-filling mechanism, which is what our argument is,\nthat would apply only in those circumstances when it's\nnecessary. Other than that, the Court has consistently\ndeferred the matter to Congress. And that's where we\nthink it ought to lie in this case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does a prisoner in a State\nthat requires the filing of a certificate of merit in a\nmedical malpractice case have a -- have an\nalternative -- a viable alternative State claim --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes, again, that's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- for malpractice?\nMR. FRANKLIN: We say yes. That issue is\nnot in this case. The Eleventh Circuit in Alba\nexpressly addressed that issue under that State's law,\nand said, yes, that is adequate. It's simply a\nprocedural requirement that applies to all plaintiffs.\nAnd I would add, by the way, that --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how is a prisoner\nsupposed to satisfy that requirement?\nMR. FRANKLIN: The same way any other\nplaintiff is supposed to -- but what I was going to add\nis that when you're alleging an Eighth Amendment\nviolation, you're talking about a claim that's by its\nnature very severe. You're talking about deliberate\nindifference to serious medical needs that constitutes\nthe unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\nIn those circumstances, we would suggest\nthat it might even be easier to procure that kind of a\ndeclaration, but that issue was decided in Alba. So,\nthat -- that was decided. If it comes up in another\ncase, it can be decided there. We don't think that that\nwould render the -- if it's -- if it's an adequate\nremedy for everyone else in that State and most States\nthat have these things, then it's an adequate remedy for\nBivens.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did any of those courts\naddress the problem of how the pro se prisoner is going\nto get an affidavit?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, Alba -- the Alba court\nis the only court that I'm aware of on the circuit level\nthat considered it, and I believe they did address that\nissue and simply said that it is -- puts them on an\nequal footing with other plaintiffs and that that would\nbe an adequate remedy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't -- I don't\nunderstand your answer to Justice Kagan. If I heard you\nright, you were saying, well, they're going to be able\nto get a certificate because it's an Eighth Amendment\nviolation, and everything is very severe. But the point\nis they're going to bring a negligence action, not an\nEighth Amendment action.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So --\nMR. FRANKLIN: I'm talking about if the\nconduct -- we're comparing here between conduct that\nwould violate the Eighth Amendment and conduct that's\nnegligent. And I'm saying if the conduct rises to the\nlevel of an Eighth Amendment violation, which is what\nwe're talking about in terms of the adequacy, then it\nwould be easier, one would presume.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But I think the question,\nMr. Franklin, is really just a practical one --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Sure.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- which is how a pro se\nperson sitting in prison is supposed to have access to a\ndoctor who will provide this certificate. And, I mean,\nmaybe there would be means, but I guess I'm asking\nwhether there would be.\nMR. FRANKLIN: I would think there would,\nbut I don't want to say -- I don't want to argue someone\nelse's case on that. I mean, I do think that that was\nan issue that was resolved, at least in the Eleventh\nCircuit in Alba. It's not an issue that applies in this\ncase because there's no such certificate here in\nCalifornia.\nI do think it would be adequate. I mean,\nBush v. Lucas, which is a Federal remedies case, said\nthere were what they called \"meaningful remedies.\" As\nlong as there's a meaningful remedy, it's sufficient.\nAnd if Congress wants to think that there's a problem,\nfor example, if Congress thinks there's a problem with\nthese certificates of merit in the case of privately run\nfacilities, then it certainly can establish a cause of\naction as it did in section 1983.\nBut the Bivens doctrine is really a narrow,\nas we say, gap-filling doctrine. And the Court has\nalways used it very sparingly. And the reason the Court\nhas done that is because there is no authority for it in\nthe language of any constitutional or statutory\nprovision.\nSo, the Court has always treaded very\ncautiously in this area. And I wouldn't rule out in\nthat circumstance that somebody could make that\nargument. I -- I just don't think in this case there\nhas been any real dispute that there's an adequate\nremedy. There wasn't in Malesko, and that was\nsufficient in that case. And we think it is sufficient\nin this case as well for the Court to in effect stay its\nBivens hand and turn the matter if necessary over to\nCongress.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Under the PLRA -- under the\nPLRA, a district judge has to perform a screening\nfunction for -- for these complaints, and is that -- is\nit going to be an impossible burden for district judges\nto ascertain the contours of State prison law, in that\nthere apparently is not a lot of prisoner litigation\nunder State law? Most prisoners seem to choose 1983.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, in this case, the\nmagistrate judge did it. It wasn't an impossible burden\nfor him. This was done on a prescreening. The court\nruled as exactly as we are asking the Court to rule now.\nThe court did it. The Court in Malesko did it. It\nwasn't difficult. If it is deemed that there's an issue\nthere, there are various procedural mechanisms that\ncould be employed. There could be a dismissal without\nprejudice, a dismissal with repleading, certification to\na State court. You could stay the Bivens action.\nThere's various things that district courts\ncan do. But in this case, it wasn't an issue. It\nwasn't an issue in Malesko. We don't think it's going\nto be an issue in other cases either.\nIf I may reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Shah.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe last three decades of this Court's\nprecedents make clear that judicial extension of a\nBivens remedy is not the default presumption. It is\npermissible only where there is no adequate alternative\nremedy and there are no other factors counseling\nhesitation. Neither criterion is satisfied here.\nRespondent is suing employees of a private\nprison corporation who, unlike their federally employed\ncounterparts, are subject to well-established theories\nof tort liability but lack a recognized qualified\nimmunity defense. Under the circumstances present here,\nwhich I submit reflect the heartland of cases alleging\nEighth Amendment violations for deliberate indifference\nto serious medical needs, recognition of the Bivens\nremedy is neither necessary nor appropriate.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shah, go back to what\nyou said about lacking -- these private -- these\nemployees of the private corporation you said lack\nqualified immunity. But they do have -- courts have\nallowed them to have a good faith defense. So, in\npractice, how different is that, whether they have\nqualified immunity or whether they have a good faith\ndefense?\nMR. SHAH: A couple of responses, Your\nHonor.\nFirst, this Court has never recognized a\ngood faith defense. So, I wouldn't call it a recognized\ndefense. It is true that some lower courts have applied\na good faith defense. Reading those cases, it's not\nentirely clear exactly what the content of that good\nfaith defense is. What is clear is that it's something\nless than qualified immunity. It appears in most of the\ncases that they're grafting on some sort of subjective\nelement, subjective intent element, on top of what you\nmust establish to get qualified immunity.\nSo, whatever it is, it's something lesser\nthan qualified immunity, and I think that in and of\nitself creates an asymmetry. But I think the larger\npoint is, is that these prisoners have alternative\nadequate remedies under State law because they're suing\na private employee rather than a government employee.\nThe government employee is subject to the\nWestfall Act, and, therefore, all civil actions other\nthan Bivens are pre-empted. And so, I think that's the\nfundamental difference. I think it further counsels\nhesitation because of the lack of a recognized immunity\ndefense, whether that's qualified immunity or good\nfaith.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you address the\nquestion posed earlier of what were to happen if there\nwas a State law that gave absolute immunity to these\nprivate correctional officers, and that was the case\nbefore us. This particular State, it's undisputed,\nwould not permit any kind of intentional or negligence\nsuit against these officers.\nMR. SHAH: Sure. Your Honor, in that\nhypothetical -- and of course, there is no suggestion in\nthis case that any State has such a rule -- but if a\nState were to adopt that such rule, I think that would\nbe a case where there is no adequate alternative remedy,\nbecause in your -- in your hypothetical, there is\nabsolute immunity. There wouldn't be a way for the\nprisoner to redress -- seek redress for the gravamen of\nhis injuries. And I think in that case, we have a very\ndifferent situation, and a Bivens remedy may well be\njustified. But --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Interesting, because\nwhat you're proposing is a sort of State-by-State,\ncircuit-by-circuit, presumably, existence of a Bivens\nclaim or not. That's really the outcome of your\nposition.\nMR. SHAH: Well, yes, Your Honor, except the\nfact that there has been no suggestion that any State\nhas such a draconian rule or has ever passed one. We're\nsimply arguing for a rule that would limit Bivens to\nwhen there is no adequate State law remedy. That's\nclearly the case here. It's clearly going to be the\ncase in the vast majority of Eighth Amendment prisoners.\nWhat this Court should not do is craft a default rule\nallowing Bivens remedies against employees of private\nprison corporations just to account for the hypothetical\npossibility that there may be a case which may or may\nnot ever arise in which an adequate alternative is not.\nThat turns Bivens jurisprudence on its head.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then I guess the\nquestion is -- yes, when you talk about an overlap of\nremedies, we have said that it doesn't need to be a\nmatching one-to-one remedy, but you do need some degree\nof meaningful overlap, don't you?\nMR. SHAH: I would agree with that, Your\nHonor. I think -- I think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how -- define how\nmuch or how do we describe the adequacy of that overlap?\nMR. SHAH: I think it would be difficult to\ncome up with a precise formulation. I think the\nformulation that we use in our brief is that as long as\nit redressed the gravamen of the prisoner's injuries.\nSo, I think as long as it provides some meaningful\nrelief for the injuries and in turn that would provide\nsome deterrence to the individual employees' actions --\nI think as long as those two elements are present, I\nthink we would think that there is an adequate\nalternative remedy.\nOr, alternatively, if you wanted to use the\nwords -- the word that this Court used in Bivens, you\ncould approach it from the flip side and say there would\nnot be an adequate alternative remedy where the State\nlaw is either inconsistent with or hostile to the\ncorresponding constitutional interest. We submit in\nthis case there's no question that there are remedies\navailable under California State law and, as far as we\nknow, the State law of every other State in this country\nthat would allow --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is -- a Bivens\naction is unusual in the first place, but it's also\nunusual to say that you don't have a Federal cause of\naction because of something a State gives you.\nDo you have any other example of something\nlike that, where the availability of Federal relief\nturns on the availability of alternative relief under\nState law?\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, it may not be an\nexact analogue, but I think Federal due process cases\noften will look at if someone's claims of deprivation of\nproperty, an unlawful deprivation of property, in\nviolation of process -- the Federal court may often look\nat what are the available State law procedures to\nprovide redress for that claim before it would impose or\nfind a violation of Federal due process.\nSo, I think there are analogues where\nFederal courts do look at the availability of State law\nremedies and look at their adequacy before determining\nwhether a Federal law remedy is necessary. And this\nCourt has done that. And the Court did it in Malesko, I\nthink is the best example in the Bivens context of where\nthe Court looked at alternative State remedies and said\nthat, hey, look, the availability of these other\nremedies counsel against the imposition of a Bivens\nremedy.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: What is the theory behind\nthat, Mr. Shah? I mean it's an obvious theory when\nCongress has provided an alternative remedial system,\nwhich is a separation of powers theory. But what's the\ntheory about looking to State law for these kinds of\nalternative remedies?\nMR. SHAH: Two responses, Your Honor. While\nI agree the separation of powers problem is much more\nheightened when Congress acts, I think there is still a\nseparation of powers issue even when Congress has not\nacted. That is, the Court should be hesitant before --\nbefore implying a judicial -- a cause of action for\ndamages under the Constitution, given that it's\ntypically been Congress's province to do so.\nBut, beyond that, the rationales -- there\nhave been two rationales that have been given by this\nCourt in its -- in its Bivens jurisprudence for implying\nsuch a remedy. One is the need to provide some\nmeaningful relief. We submit when there is an\nalternative State remedy, that rationale has been\nsatisfied.\nThe other rationale this Court has offered\nis provide some deterrence to the actions of an\nindividual employee or officer. We also submit that\nwhen there is a State tort damages remedy available,\nthat rationale too will be accomplished.\nThe three cases in which this Court has\nrecognized a Bivens remedy, Bivens itself, Davis, and\nCarlson, those two factors were not present. There was\neither no alternative remedy at all or, at least as in\nCarlson, no alternative remedy against the individual\nofficer.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What would you propose that\nthe Court say about the degree of adequate State remedy\nthat is necessary? Just -- what we have here in\nCalifornia is enough and not go any further or --\nMR. SHAH: I think the Court should start\nwith that. Certainly, here there hasn't been any\ndispute that there would be -- any real serious dispute\nthat there would be an adequate alternative remedy. I\nthink the Court could also say that, as long as the\nadequate alternative remedy addresses the gravamen of\nthe prisoner's injuries, that should be sufficient. And\nI think it could give content to that by looking at the\ntwo rationales this Court has offered for Bivens.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that a State did for\nclaims against private prisons and private prison guards\nwhat I understand New York has done with respect to\nState-run prisons; in other words, that you eliminate\nany claim against individual prison employees or guards\nand give the prisoner just a tort claim against the\nState. Would that be adequate?\nMR. SHAH: I think that would be a tougher\ncase. And, of course, I assume in your hypothetical\nthat that's -- that that would also apply to Federal\nprisoners and federally contracted prisons, and it's\ndifficult to figure out what the State's interests --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Not a claim against the\nState. I misspoke. A claim -- only a claim against the\ncompany that runs the prison.\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, again I think that\nwould be a more difficult hypothetical because the\nrational about individual deterrence of the individual\nofficer may not be as strong in that hypothetical. But,\nonce again, no State has such a rule, and it's difficult\nto imagine a State's incentive to adopt such a rule\nbecause it's not coming out of the State's pockets.\nThese are federally contracted prisons, contracted by\nBOP and run by private prison corporations.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the character\nof the claim? If it's a Bivens claim, it's a\nconstitutional claim. It's an Eighth Amendment claim.\nAnd if you're looking to State remedies, that's an\nordinary tort remedy with no constitutional involvement.\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, it is true, the\nlabels are different and there's going to be different\nmeaning to those remedies. But from the prisoner's\nstandpoint, the rationale behind Bivens was to provide\nsome damages relief. From the prisoner's standpoint,\nit's not going to matter, I would submit, whether that\n-- those damages are procured under State law or under a\nconstitutionally implied action.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Preis.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. PREIS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. PREIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question before the Court today is\nwhether a Federal prisoner's access to constitutional\nremedies should turn on the mere happenstance of where\nthe prisoner is detained. The Petitioners' chief\nargument is that privately held Federal prisoners should\nnot have an Eighth Amendment damages remedy because they\nhave remedies under State law. This argument suffers\nfrom two flaws. First, it misconceives this Court's\nBivens jurisprudence; second, it misconceives the nature\nof State remedies available to prisoners.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why are State\nremedies -- what of your clients' claims could not be\nvindicated under State law? And why is a Bivens action\nsuperior to a negligence action in California?\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor, with regard to the\nclaims that can't be vindicated under State law, we\nthink it's likely that his medical malpractice claims,\nthe claims against the doctors, could be vindicated. We\ndon't think the law is clear in -- excuse me -- in\nCalifornia that his other claims, the deprivation of\nnutrition and hygiene, forced labor at some point before\nhe was -- his injuries were healed, that those would\nnecessarily be covered.\nWe admit there's a chance, as we did in our\nbrief, that it's possible the California Supreme Court\ncould say, well, there has been an intermediate\nappellate court who has decided this. We take on\nguidance that and believe these remedies would be\ncovered. But there's nothing here that could -- that\ncould assure this Court that that's the way it will work\nout.\nWith regards to why Bivens are superior,\nBivens are superior when there's no State cause of\naction. So, there will be some cases, as we concede,\nwhere a State cause of action is available. The reason\nMr. Pollard brings a Federal cause of action in this\ncase is because it's not clear that State remedies are\ncertainly available.\nAnd I think the certainty is an important\nthing for this Court to remember. The issue before\nBivens itself was whether or not this Court should adopt\na system of State remedies. And the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The specific case where the\nState remedy is not available is?\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor, I'm not aware of any\nparticular case where a State --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no, no. Your --\nMR. PREIS: Oh, excuse me.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your allegation which you\nbelieve states a valid claim under Bivens action but not\nunder State law is?\nMR. PREIS: The claims that we say do not\nhave a State law --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand\nspecifically what they are. I mean, it sounds to me\nthat if a person (a) deliberately starves somebody to\ndeath, for example, or deliberately gives him something\nwhich will make him sick when he eats it, that that\nwould at least be negligence and would arise under\nordinary State tort law. So, I'm curious to know what\nyour claim is that does not arise under ordinary State\ntort law?\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor, I think at the\nstarkest example, if it was the case that somebody\nactually starved someone --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, give me -- don't answer\nmy -- forget my hypothetical. Tell me your specific\nclaim that does not arise under State tort law. That's\nall I want to know. Which is the same question I\nheard -- I just didn't hear the answer to.\nMR. PREIS: Oh, excuse me, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I heard the answer in\ngeneral.\nMR. PREIS: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to know specifically\nwhat you say they did to your client that doesn't make\nout a State tort claim.\nMR. PREIS: He brings four claims that he\nthink alleges an Eighth Amendment violation. One is the\nmedical malpractice, which we concede is likely\navailable; the other three, we do not find sufficient\nevidence in California law that there will certainly be\na remedy.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I heard you say --\nMR. PREIS: And those three are --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that. I just want to\nknow what it is physically you say the defendant did to\nyour client, so that I can evaluate your statement that\nCalifornia gives no tort remedy for that.\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Sorry, I don't mean to\nsound irritated, but I just have trouble getting my\nquestion across.\nMR. PREIS: Understood, Your Honor. Mr.\nPollard was deprived of adequate food and hygiene. A\nsecond claim, he was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. They failed to\ngive him adequate food for what? So he could live, or\nfor what?\nMR. PREIS: Well, yes, adequate nutrition.\nI'm not saying to the point of death, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They gave him -- and if a\nperson in California who has charge of -- of a ward or\nsomeone fails adequately to nourish that ward, you're\nsaying California tort law gives no remedy?\nMR. PREIS: I'm saying there's no evidence\nthat it does, Your Honor. I think it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would call it like\nnegligence, you give a remedy. If it's not negligent,\nit's deliberate? Or what?\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor, I think I would\nput -- I think the best way to approach that question is\nto look at the shoes of an attorney. When if someone\ncomes in and says I was deprived of these benefits that\nI was entitled to and I was suffered a harm, the\nquestion would be for the lawyer as well, I'll go read\nthe case --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You can't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The lawyer would say, I\ncan't find a starving case in California; so, you must\nnot have a cause of action.\nIs that what the lawyer would say?\nMR. PREIS: No, I think the lawyer would\nsay, I can't be certain. I haven't found a case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It seems odd to me because\nthe Eighth Amendment says cruel and unusual punishment.\nSo, you have to have a cruel treatment. And where a\nperson deliberately or negligently subjects someone else\nto cruel treatment, my -- my law school recollection of\nmany years ago is that there ordinarily is a tort\naction.\nSo, that's what I'd like you -- I'm\nsuspicious of your statement that there isn't.\nMR. PREIS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Therefore, I ask for some\nelaboration of that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you have besides\nstarving? What -- what else?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PREIS: The other claims were, after he\nsuffered his injuries, he was put back on his work\ndetail before his injuries were healed. He was also,\nimmediately after being injured, forced to sort of\nendure excessive security measures, forced to wear\nparticular handcuffs that pushed his arms in a -- in a\nway that was -- caused extraordinary pain and was\nunnecessary.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Can I ask you the same\nquestion that I asked Mr. Franklin? Because it just\ndoesn't make any sense to me. The gravamen of this\nclaim is a medical malpractice claim. Why aren't your\nState law remedies better? You have vicarious\nliability, and all you have to prove is negligence. Why\nwasn't this brought as a State law claim?\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor, I think there's two\nparts to that, two answers I would give. First, Mr.\nPollard was put in a Federal prison by the Federal\nGovernment. He often has access -- actually only has\naccess to Federal law books. When he sees himself\ninjured, he thinks this is presumably a Federal case.\nSo, I think there is a certain ethic or, at least,\npractice, is how that works.\nNow, why wouldn't medical malpractice work\nhere?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that would be false\nconsciousness that we can correct, right?\nMR. PREIS: Excuse me, Your Honor, I missed\nthe beginning.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, if the -- if the\ntrue appropriate remedy, and the better remedy from your\nclient's point of view, is a State law action, we should\njust say bring a State law action.\nMR. PREIS: Well, we think that prisoners\nshould have access to the State law action, and when\nthere's cause of action available, it might indeed be a\nbetter remedy. But I think in terms of whether or not\nmedical malpractice works here, it will work in terms of\ndeterring the medical professionals, but we have\nmultiple defendants in this case, not all of them -- of\nwhich would be culpable under -- or liable under a\nmedical malpractice regime. How do we handle the other\nprisoners -- excuse me -- the other defendants?\nSo, I think you're focused in terms of the\nremedies available, and I would concede, of course,\nthat's important to the -- to the prisoner. But, of\ncourse, the Court is concerned with deterrence in these\ncases.\nSo, I want to return to Justice Breyer's\nquestion, if I might. The gravamen of this case is that\nin ordinary cases, most of the time -- and the Court is\nrequired in this case to figure how big is that \"most of\nthe time\"? Is it 99 percent of time? Is it 80 percent\nof the time? And that's what we simply don't have\nevidence on in this case. And I want to point --\nJUSTICE BREYER: When I went to law school,\nwhich was many years ago, instead of talking about,\nlike, starvation cases or medical malpractice, they\ntalked about a general thing called negligence.\nMR. PREIS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it seemed to apply to\ndoctors, and then it was medical malpractice, and it\napplied to others, and -- and is there something here\nthat wouldn't fall in that general kind of rubric or the\ngeneral terms of California tort law?\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor, I guess your --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I know, I don't want\nyou just to repeat yourself.\nMR. PREIS: No --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, I guess I have the best\nanswer I have.\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor, I'll say two things\nto that. First, I think what you're asking me to do,\nand which in a sense the Court will be required to do in\nthis case, is predict what State supreme courts will do\non a regular basis. And I would suggest -- suggest\nthat's sort of an extraordinary measure to take in a\ncase where you have Federal prisoners, Federal\nconstitutional rights, and Federal actors.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- asking us to do is\nlimit our inquiry to California?\nMR. PREIS: Excuse me.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Limit it to California.\nWhat -- what --\nMR. PREIS: I don't --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They're saying don't\nlook at what other courts will do; just look at the\nState you're in, the place you're going to make your\nclaim, and figure out whether your claims are covered or\nnot covered essentially in those -- in that State.\nMR. PREIS: They're suggesting this Court\nlook only at California.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right.\nMR. PREIS: We don't think that is\nappropriate. This Court's view has always been that a\nBivens action exists or does not exist with regards to a\nentire category of defendants, or the context.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, so, if there is one\nState that would not have an adequate remedy for any --\nany single bad thing that could happen in prison,\nthere's a Bivens action for everybody for everything?\nIs that what you're saying?\nMR. PREIS: Yes, Your Honor, we are.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wow.\nMR. PREIS: I think if the Court were to\nwrite an opinion in that case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I certainly wouldn't want\nto hold that.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PREIS: I'm not surprised that you\nwouldn't want to hold that, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would find that rather\nsurprising, too, actually.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PREIS: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because I -- I think what\nthey're asking to do is fine. On their theory, you have\nno problem because you go back and show to the court\nthat there is no remedy in California for shackling a\nperson, I guess, deliberately, with knowledge that that\nwould cause severe pain, and if you can show that, then\nyou're going to have your Bivens action in respect to\nthat.\nMR. PREIS: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That -- what they're saying\nis that you're not going to be able to show that; so, it\ndoesn't worry them.\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor, I think that the --\nthe view that there's an ordinary duty of care, a duty\nto be reasonable, is quite a bit more complex than the\nPetitioners would make it out to be. Let me offer an\nexample. In this case, in 2007 the district court\ndismissed Mr. Pollard's complaint. The district court\nsaid you have State remedies.\nWell, what was the proof for that? What was\nthe State law remedies that existed? The only thing the\ndistrict court cited in a footnote was section 1714 of\nCalifornia's civil code.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who says that the burden is\non the other side? Why isn't the burden on you, if you\nwant to bring a Bivens action, on you, to show that\nthere is not an adequate State remedy?\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're the plaintiff here.\nYou're trying to bring the Federal cause of action. Our\nlaw is clear; if there's an adequate remedy we don't\ninvent one. Why isn't it your burden to show that there\nis not an adequate State remedy?\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor, two answers to that.\nFirst of all, this Court's most recent case where it\ndealt with whether or not a burden should exist was\nWilkie, and there, the majority of the Court said, when\nwe look at alternative remedies, we try to figure out,\nquote, \"whether they amount to a\" -- \"amount to a\nconvincing reason for the judicial branch to refrain\nfrom providing a new and free-standing remedy.\"\nInasmuch as there has been burden discussion in this\nCourt's case law, it would seem to fall -- fall on the\nother side.\nNow, I think there's an important point here\nwhen we think of burdens. This case is so close to\nCarlson that really the burden should be on them to take\nit out of Carlson. I want to address Carlson for a\nsecond, if I may.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, before you do,\non page 5 of your brief you say, in the private prison\nsetting, quote, \"'a Bivens claim against the offending\nindividual offending officer,'\" end quote, is an\nappropriate remedy. And the quote is from Malesko.\nMR. PREIS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What we said in\nMalesko, where you quote, is that if a Federal prisoner\nin a BOP facility alleges a constitutional deprivation,\nhe may bring a Bivens claim against the offending\nindividual officer. Now, your friend describes that as\na distortion of what we said in Malesko, and I just\nwanted to give you a chance to reply to what I think is\na fairly serious assertion.\nMR. PREIS: Yes, Your Honor, and I would\nseriously disagree with the suggestion it's a\ndistortion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just to be\nclear, you quote that language -- you say \"in the\nprivate prison setting\"; and the language specifically\nsays in a BOP facility.\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor, what the Court was\nspeaking of in that section of its opinion was that the\nremedies between a BOP facility and individuals in a\nprivate facility should be similar, that it made no\nsense to give extra remedies to people in a private\nfacility. And so, the Court, Justice -- Chief Justice\nRehnquist at the time, was making a comparison saying\nthere should be a general symmetry. And all we are\npointing out in that quote is that inasmuch as symmetry\nmatters, well, the Court there in Malesko had said,\nwell, we would likely expect there to be an individual\nremedy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would expect the\nsame rule. That's your argument --\nMR. PREIS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to apply in the\nprivate prison setting. What you say is that there we\nexplained that, in the private prison setting, a Bivens\nclaim against the offending individual officer was the\nappropriate remedy.\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor, I guess I certainly\ntook part of the quote and didn't use all of the quote,\nbut I did not in any means say -- mean to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's known as misquoting.\nMR. PREIS: Well, Your Honor, I guess I\nwould respectfully differ.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you be taking the\nposition that even if there is an alternative State\nremedy, tort remedy, even so there ought to be a\nparallel Bivens action? Or would you say no Bivens\naction if all of the States have adequate tort remedies?\nMR. PREIS: I think, Your Honor, if this\nCourt would -- could tell with confidence that States,\nin all States, provided sufficient remedies for the\nentire variety of Eighth Amendment violations, this\nCourt would be certainly wise in allowing State remedies\nto work. But I think we're far from that situation.\nI want to turn, if I may --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Could you give me your best\nexample of a State tort rule that would prevent a\nprisoner from bringing an Eighth Amendment claim?\nMR. PREIS: Excuse me, Your Honor. Could\nyou repeat that question?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Your best example of a tort\nrule from any State that would preclude a -- a valid\nEighth Amendment claim.\nMR. PREIS: In other words, the prisoner\nwould have an Eighth Amendment claim but not a tort --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You have 50 States' worth of\ntort law to -- as your playground, and I want to know\nwhat tort rule would keep a prisoner with a valid Eighth\nAmendment claim -- would prevent him from recovering?\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor, I would note\nMaryland, for example. In Maryland, attacks by a\nprisoner on another prisoner are evaluated in terms of\nthe liability of the warden; a lot evaluate it on a\nmaliciousness standard. Now, the standard this Court\nuses in attacks by one prisoner against another is a\ndeliberate indifference standard. The deliberate\nindifference standard is different.\nWe're not arguing in this case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what\nyou're talking about. Is this a suit against a prisoner\nwho was attacked?\nMR. PREIS: Excuse me, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's not liable unless he's\nmalicious, or what?\nMR. PREIS: No, it's a suit against the\nwarden --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The warden.\nMR. PREIS: -- for a failure to protect\nsomeone against attack by another prisoner.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see. And -- and the\nwarden is liable in Maryland, you say, only if he is\nmalicious?\nMR. PREIS: The test in Maryland is\nmaliciousness, yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about medical\nmalpractice caps? Is that an issue? In other words,\nState law -- and I don't know how many there are; I know\nit's been proposed -- I think it's true in some\ncases will cap your recovery for medical malpractice at\na particular level.\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor, I don't think it's a\nsignificant difference in this case. For instance,\nCalifornia --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was -- that was a\nhelpful question, in the sense that --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PREIS: Oh, I understand. I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Bivens action --\npresumably the cap would not apply. But it applies\nunder State law.\nMR. PREIS: I think there will be some cases\nin which the remedies will be curtailed under State law.\nAnd one could expect that the deterrent value of a State\nlaw remedy would not be available.\nI have a couple of minutes remaining, and I\nwant to turn to Carlson. I think the suggestion is in\nthis that we've -- the discussion that we have had so\nfar is that we're asking the Court to reach out and\ncreate an extraordinary cause of action. I simply don't\nthink that's true. This case is very similar if not the\nsame as Carlson.\nIn Carlson, the Court said that a Federal\nprisoner has a cause of action against Federal actors\nfor a Federal constitutional right. That's what this\ncase is. And the only distinction the Petitioners can\npoint to is the fact that they are privately employed\nFederal actors as opposed to publicly employed Federal\nactors.\nSo, the question becomes, is \"privately\nemployed\" Federal actor a meaningful distinction from\n\"publicly employed\"? We would -- if that distinction is\nmeaningful, we would have expected to find some\ndiscussion of it in Malesko, but the Court there paid\nabsolutely no attention to the private status. The\nCourt in Malesko said that Malesko, that case, was in\nevery meaningful sense the same as FDIC v. Meyer.\nFDIC v. Meyer was a suit against a public agency.\nIf the case is in every meaningful sense the\nsame as Meyer, then it must have been what mattered to\nthe Court in Malesko was that it was a suit against an\nentity, not public versus private. So, we think there's\nno evidence in this case that -- or, excuse me -- no --\nnothing in the law that suggests this Court cares and\never has cared the distinction between public and\nprivate remedies.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in Carlson, it was\nBivens or no damage remedy. Here, that's not the case.\nMR. PREIS: Excuse me, Your Honor, I missed\nthe first part of the question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In Carlson, the Court was\noperating on the theory that with respect to the Federal\nemployee, it was a Bivens remedy for damages or no\nremedy at all.\nMR. PREIS: No individual remedy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.\nMR. PREIS: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And here, it is different\nfrom Carlson because there is an -- a remedy against an\nindividual. So, we have the parallel remedies here\nwhich didn't exist in Carlson, and that makes the two\ncases different.\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor, I think it's fair to\nsay that, in Carlson, the Court expressed a preference\nfor an individual remedy over an entity remedy. But I\ndon't think it's fair to say that the Court addressed in\nCarlson how it would compare to individual remedies.\nThat issue actually came up in Bivens.\nThere was an individual remedy proposed that would be\navailable under State law, and the alternative was a\nremedy under the Constitution itself. So, when the\nCourt was faced with two alternative individual actions,\nthe Court said that we prefer the constitutional cause\nof action. And the reason in Bivens was we can't be\ncertain really how State law works.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you disagree\nthat the -- I know you have your argument on\ncompensation --\nMR. PREIS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- but with respect\nto deterrence, is there any significant difference\nbetween the two causes of action? In other words, if\nyou think the most significant aspect of Bivens is\nto deter constitutional violations, doesn't that work\nequally as well or perhaps more effectively under the\nState law than under Bivens?\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor, I think in the end\nthe question asks me to make a 50-State assessment of\nhow State law works, and in that sense, one can only\nspeak in generalizations.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your answer --\nyour answer is the same as under compensation, that the\nState law might be different or not?\nMR. PREIS: We think, inasmuch as a cause of\naction is available, with the exception, as the Court\nnoted, of damages caps, there -- we would expect to have\na similar level of deterrence, provided that damages are\navailable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who -- who actually\nends up paying in these Bivens actions? Is it the -- I\nmean --\nMR. PREIS: What we don't know for --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the Federal\nGovernment or an individual or --\nMR. PREIS: We would expect -- first of all,\nobviously, the liability is imposed on the individual.\nWe would expect, as a general matter, that there would\nbe indemnification by the corporation. The question\nthen is, of course, whether that gets passed on to the\nFederal Government. And I don't think it's fair -- if\nthe Court allows a Bivens action here, I think there's\nthe suggestion that all of a sudden, there'll be a whole\nnew realm of liability and costs. And that's simply not\nthe case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm just looking in\nterms of the practical deterrence. The problem I've had\nwith it in general, I don't know how much practical\ndeterrence there is as if you sue the individual and\nthe -- the individual doesn't actually pay; the\ngovernment does. It seems to me perhaps more likely in\nthe private context that the individual may get stuck\nwith some amount of the liability if the employer just\nsays, look, you were off doing something you weren't\nsupposed to do; we're not going to pay for it.\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor, I'm not versed in\nthe indemnification rules of private prisons, but I\nwould expect that there will be some instances where\nthere's indemnification. I think the general rule in\nterms of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that the\nwarden of a Maryland prison is aware that if -- if he\nallows one prisoner to beat up another prisoner, he is\nonly liable for maliciousness and not for deliberate\nindifference, if indeed there is a difference between\nthe two? Do you think that -- that he's threading the\nneedle that finely, as far as -- as far as deterrence is\nconcerned?\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor, I think it's always\nbeen this Court's presumption that actors, legal actors,\nrespond to the standards of law that are imposed. I\ncan't say --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not at that level of -- of\nrefinement. I mean, it seems to me that any warden\nknows he's subject to State tort law and that State tort\nlaw renders him liable for negligence and, indeed, for\nphysical assaults. Some of your causes of action are\nintentional torts, not even negligence. I find it hard\nto believe that, as far as deterrence is concerned,\nthere's a dime's worth of difference between State law\nand -- and the Bivens action you're asking for.\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor, if it's the case\nthat there's not a dime's worth of difference, that\nwould only be at this point. And one can expect State\nlaw to change over time. I think one of the questions\npropounded to Mr. Franklin or Mr. Shah was, what if a\nState imposed a -- or created absolute immunity? I\nthink -- I take Your Honor's point to be that there\ncould be a similarity at one point. And we agree that\nthat could exist for any -- for a particular\ncircumstance. But we don't think this Court should take\nthe enforcement of Federal rights in Federal prisons\nwith regard to Federal actors and set up a scheme where\nthat's handled through State law. There's simply not a\njustification there.\nYour Honor, I'd like to address the Westfall\nAct. They argue strenuously that Congress has already\nspoken in this case. And that's simply not the case.\nIn the -- put it this way: The FTCA and the Westfall\nAct deal only with Federal employees, the liability of\nthe Federal Government for actions of Federal employees.\nTheir argument is essentially that Congress attempted to\ndeal with whether or not private contractors should be\nliable in these situations by -- by amending a statute\nthat has nothing to do with private contractors. And\nthat simply doesn't work. It's not -- there's no\nsuggestion here that Congress attempted to address this\nsituation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what was the\npurpose of making the reference to private contractors\nin the Westfall Act?\nMR. PREIS: Your Honor, the Court -- excuse\nme -- Congress did not make a reference to private\ncontractors in the Westfall Act. They simply -- the\nCongress simply referred to employees of the United\nStates. And the reason the Court -- excuse me --\nCongress referred to employees of the United States was\nbecause the FTCA only applies, and has always only\napplied, to contractors -- excuse me -- employees of the\nUnited States. There would have been no reason to reach\nout because it would be totally beyond the specter of\nthe FTCA itself.\nI think, Your Honor, there's something else\nto note here with regard to Congress. At most, what\nwe're dealing with here is congressional silence. They\nsuggest that Congress is fit to take care of this.\nNobody doubts that Congress is fit to step in and take\ncare of this at some point in time. But -- this Court's\npractice with regards to Bivens has been, when Congress\nsteps in, to stand back. But here we have congressional\nsilence. As this -- as the Court said in 2007, its most\nrecent Bivens case was, when you're dealing -- well,\nexcuse me -- the Wilkie case did not involve any\nspecific congressional action. The Court viewed it\nessentially as congressional silence. The majority of\nthis Court at that time said our evaluation in that\ninstance is to figure out -- excuse me -- whether the\nFederal courts must make the kind of remedial\ndetermination that is appropriate for a common law\ntribunal. The Court at that point saw itself as a\ncommon law tribunal within the specific circumstance of\nwhether or not a Bivens remedy should be available.\nThat's not to say the Court should adopt some sort of\nroving common law power. It's simply to say where\nthere's congressional silence and the case looks almost\nidentical to Carlson, if not identical, that there's\nsufficient reason for this Court to find a Bivens cause\nof action here.\nIf there's no further questions, I urge this\nCourt to affirm the holding of the Ninth Circuit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Franklin, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FRANKLIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI just wanted to correct one possible\nmisimpression. There's no allegation here that anyone\nwas deliberately starved. With the allegation regarding\nthe food, his allegation in his complaint is that he --\nbecause presumably his arms were in casts, he couldn't\nhold his tray in the cafeteria, and, therefore, he says,\nI had to buy my own food from the commissary because I\ndidn't want to be humiliated by going to the cafeteria.\nWe think that if that claim somehow stated a\nclaim under the Eighth Amendment for deliberate\nindifference, that it would state a claim under\nnegligence as well. And all of these claims essentially\nare that the prison failed to accommodate his injuries.\nMalesko was the same. In Malesko, the argument was: I\ndidn't get to use an elevator because I had a\npre-existing condition, and that's what caused my harm.\nIf there is something that negligently\ncauses harm, unreasonably causes harm, there is a remedy\nin California. I would also note that if it does not\ncause harm, there's no Bivens remedy, because Congress\nin the PLRA has said you cannot bring any claim, if\nyou're a prisoner, in Federal court unless it involves\nphysical harm.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you want us to hold that\nthere's no Bivens action in California? Is that -- is\nthat what our opinion is going to say?\nMR. FRANKLIN: I think the opinion could be\nas it was in Malesko: There is no Bivens action because\nthere are alternative remedies. We think that holding\nas in Malesko would apply everywhere. Everybody has --\nevery State has a negligence cause of action. And I\nthink one thing that crystallized the argument for me is\nthe colloquy between Justice Scalia and -- and my\nfriend, where I think there was an admission that what\nthey are actually seeking is a blanket cause of action\nto account for any possible instance in which there is\nan inadequate remedy.\nI think it goes even further. I think\nthey're asking for a blanket cause of action if somebody\ncan hypothesize an interest, an issue, and even further\nthan that, even if we can't hypothesize it, maybe\nsomewhere along the line, something might happen. We\nthink that's a -- flipping, turning Bivens on its head.\nBivens is a narrow remedy that is only allowed when it\nis necessary. If those circumstances arise, they can be\ndealt with at that time.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know if any of\nthese Bivens claims have been pled in the alternative;\nthat is, a Bivens remedy, but alternatively State law?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes, that does happen, Your\nHonor. Yes. And it happens I think relatively\nfrequently. But in these circumstances, we would\nexpect, if the Court rules our way, that there would be\nin fact resort to what are not only adequate, but\nsuperior, State law remedies and that Bivens would then\nbe reserved for another day if something happened that\nmight implicate it.\nIf there are no further questions --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there diversity in\nthis case?\nMR. FRANKLIN: There may be. I think -- I\nthink he alleged that there was. We would agree with\nthe other side that the domicile of a -- of a prisoner\nis, at least in the circuits, determined by where the\nprisoner had been before they were in prison, and I\nthink this particular prisoner had been somewhere other\nthan California. So, probably. I can't -- I can't say\nabout the -- the amount in controversy, but probably.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you said there was a\nstatute of limitations problem with starting new.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about, if there is\ndiversity --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, the case was dismissed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- allowing an amendment?\nMR. FRANKLIN: There's no -- the case was\ndismissed, Your Honor, and it was appealed only on the\nground of a Bivens claim. So, if that is rejected,\nthere is no more case. There's nothing to amend.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
