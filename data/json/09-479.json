        "content": "(11:06 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 09-479, Abbott v. United States, and the\nconsolidated case, 7073, Gould v. United States.\nMr. Horan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. HORAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 09-7073\nMR. HORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe statutory interpretation question here\nis what laws trigger section 924(c)(1)(A)'s \"except\"\nclause. Mr. Gould offers an interpretation that gives\nmeaning and effect to every word and phrase of section\n924(c)(1)(A) and that follows this Court's recent\nholdings regarding the broad scope of the phrase \"any\nother provision of law.\"\nThe government, on the other hand, advocates\na narrow construction that is not supported by the text\nand defends it primarily on the basis that section\n924(c) supposedly should always produce the most severe\nmandatory minimum sentence for every defendant.\nRespectfully, the government's\ninterpretation is incorrect. Its reading gives no\npractical effect to the phrase \"any other provision of\nlaw,\" and the government has not cited and has yet to\neven attempt to distinguish this Court's recent\ninterpretation of the very same phrase, \"any other\nprovision of law,\" in Republic of Iraq v. Beaty just\nlast year.\nUnlike the government's, Mr. Gould's\ninterpretation is true to the text; it is true to this\nCourt's holdings; and it's true to Congress's evident\npurpose in 924(c)(1)(A), and in particular in its\n\"except\" clause.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the text of this is\nso clear, how is it that Mr. Gould and Mr. Abbott\npropose different interpretations of this provision?\nMR. HORAN: Your Honor, as a judicial\nmatter, I would note that I think our interpretations\nare not that far apart. But -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But they are not the same,\nare they?\nMR. HORAN: They are not. And our\ninterpretation, we believe, is the closest to the actual\ntext. Our interpretation requires reading no language\ninto the text. It -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't there -- isn't it -\nthere is a missing prepositional phrase in this -- in\nthe provision that we are looking at?\nIt says, \"except to the extent that a\ngreater minimum sentence is otherwise provided.\" For\nwhat? And all of you have to -- are filling in the\nprepositional phrase. For an offense of conviction,\nfor -- for an offense that's part of the --of the\nunderlying transaction, for a violation of this\nparticular provision or one that's very similar to it.\nThere is just no way of getting around the\nfact that something has to be read in there. Something\nis implied; isn't that right?\nMR. HORAN: Your Honor, respectfully, I\nbelieve under our interpretation, it -- there is -- you\ndo have to understand something to be in there, but we\nare not actually reading anything into the text. That\nis the reason -- to be sure, the words \"any kind of\nconviction\" are not in there.\nHowever, the most natural reading of the\ntext, without adding anything to it, is that\n924(c)(1)(A) requires a 5-year -- at least a 5-year\nminimum sentence, in addition to any sentence for the\npredicate drug trafficking or violent crime, except to\nthe extent that a greater minimum sentence is provided\nfor the defendant by subsection 924(c) or by any other\nprovision of law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that means there would\nbe no punishment, added punishment, at all for the\npossession of the gun; that is, you have the -- the\npossession with intent to distribute, no gun involved,\nand you get 10 years mandatory minimum for that. That\nautomatically would wipe out any add-on for the gun,\nunder your reading.\nMR. HORAN: Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg.\nAnd to follow on that, it is true that our\ninterpretation -- we think that the plain text dictates\nthat if the \"except\" clause is triggered, the lesser\nmandatory minimum sentence under 924(c)(1)(A) shall not\nbe imposed; that is -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You keep\nsaying that you're not reading anything into the statute\nunder your interpretation, but you are. You are\nlimiting the -- the \"any other provision of law\" to any\nother provision of law specified in the charging -- in\nthe counts of conviction, correct?\nMR. HORAN: That is the -- yes, Your Honor.\nWe are recognizing that limitation.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you -- you said to\nJustice Alito that you weren't reading anything in, but\nyou are. You're reading into it that the other\nprovision of -- of law to refer to counts of conviction\nat sentencing, correct?\nMR. HORAN: That is correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So why is\nthat read-in logical, meaning it's giving no extra\npunishment for the possession of a firearm?\nMR. HORAN: Your Honor, two things -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which was, I think,\nJustice Ginsburg's -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. I think you weren't\nfinished answering my question.\nMR. HORAN: If I may -- and I think then -\nI think it will help in answering your question, Justice\nSotomayor. That is correct. The only thing I would\nsay -- the thing I would additionally say, though, is\nthat there is, under the sentencing guidelines, which\nmust be applied even now, as -- to provide a recommended\nrange, there would in each of these instances be a\nfirearm enhancement that enhances the underlying\npredicate offenses' sentence that the defendant would be\nfacing and also how the -- the district court would\nwork. So I believe -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that is not\nmandatory?\nMR. HORAN: That is no longer mandatory.\nThat is correct.\nAnd then with regard to your question,\nJustice -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you're saying that the\ngun possession can be accounted for by the judge as a\nmatter of discretion using guidelines, but there's no\nmandatory at all?\nMR. HORAN: Yes, Your Honor. That is\ncorrect. There would no longer be a mandatory sentence\nfor -- or mandatory additional punishment for the\nfirearm possession.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and I suppose the\nprosecution can alter the consequence based on what it\nchooses to bring in a single prosecution.\nI mean, if it has other -- other\nenhancements, it should bring a separate prosecution for\nthat. So long as it brings it in one suit, you say, in\none prosecution, you get the break. But if -- if the\nother enhancement is brought -- has been brought in a\nseparate prosecution, you don't get it.\nMR. HORAN: Justice Scalia, I think that's\ncorrect to an extent. The -- the main exception to\nthat -- and I think it's a significant one -- is that\nthe \"except\" clause would most often be triggered in the\nmine run of cases by the predicate drug trafficking or\nviolent crime that carries with it a greater mandatory\nminimum sentence. That is, for double jeopardy\npurposes, the same offense as 924(c).\nSo, in fact, there is a significant\nconstraint on the prosecution, that it cannot bring a\nseparate prosecution for 924(c) and its predicate drug\nor trafficking -- drug trafficking or violent crime. So\nit's a significant limitation on this -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Yes, I understand\nwhat you're saying.\nMR. HORAN: Okay. And Justice Sotomayor, to\nreturn to your question, if I could answer it in two\nparts. First -- and I didn't mean to overstate, if I\ndid -- we are not reading additional language into it.\nOur reading is contained within the context and the\nactual text that -- that is confined to section 924(c).\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Explain how, because you\njust said to Justice Scalia that if the mandatory\nminimum is in a separate charging instrument, then it\ndoesn't affect you at all. It only affects you if the\ncount is in a count of conviction at sentencing.\nMR. HORAN: Yes, Your Honor. That is\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what in the language\nof 924(c) sets forth that limitation?\nMR. HORAN: Your Honor, I would say that it\nis the words \"is otherwise provided\" and the context in\nwhich any textual reading -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but there\n\"otherwise provided by law\" could be Federal, State\nlaws. It could be in the indictment, not in the\nindictment. You're proposing that we limit this\nsomehow, but I want to see what the language is that\nyou're relying upon to limit it.\nMR. HORAN: Your Honor, it is -- first of\nall, the statute begins by directing the defendant -- I\nmean, directing the district court to \"any person.\" So\nthey're focusing on the defendant. That is the\noffense-defining provision, to be sure, of the sentence.\nBut the -- throughout the text, it also\ndirects the district court to take account of minimum\nsentences that are provided for other crimes; for\ninstance, primarily the predicate -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In relationship to what?\nIsn't that the government's argument, which is that you\nhave to say in relationship to something, whether it's\nthe indictment or, as the government would have it, in\nrelationship to the possession or carrying of a firearm?\nWhy isn't that the more natural reading?\nMR. HORAN: Your Honor, because that -\nbecause the statute as a whole is essentially\ninstructions to the district court on how to sentence a\ndefendant, if at all, for the 924(c)(1)(A) offense.\nIt directs them to, after considering the\nperson in front of them, to impose a sentence of 5 years\nor less, in addition to the predicate -- any penalty for\nthe -- the predicate drug trafficking or violent crime,\nexcept to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is\notherwise provided.\nThe natural reading of that is -- and must\nbe -- that it is a -- a greater minimum sentence is\nprovided for that defendant; that is, before the\nparticular district court with the particular offenses\nthat he has before him at sentencing.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Don't most crimes of\nviolence and drug trafficking carry more than a 5-year\nsentence?\nMR. HORAN: Many of them do, Your Honor. In\nfact, those that carry a mandatory minimum sentence\nlargely carry -- all carry, in fact, 10 years.\nThere are some -- there are some both\npredicate drug trafficking offenses and predicate\nviolent crimes that carry either no minimum at all or a\nmandatory minimum of 5 years or less, and so would not\ntrigger the except clause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So let's suppose somebody\ncommits a rape and a maiming in the same -- in the same\ncriminal act. You're saying that the prosecution -- and\nlet's assume it's his third. It's his third violent\ncrime. So he would get the enhancement as being, you\nknow, a three-time violent crime loser.\nYou're saying he could get that enhancement\nand the enhancement under this -- under this gun -- he\nhad a gun at the same time. He can get it if the\nprosecution charges rape in one prosecution, for which\nhe will get the three-time loser enhancement, and then\nin a separate prosecution, it charges maiming and the\nuse of a firearm. Then he gets both enhancements,\nright?\nMR. HORAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That seems -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not sure that that's\nright. I think that -- that this may well apply to the\ncrime that is being -- that is being prosecuted where\nthe crime is defined as a real offense in the world,\nwith the limitations put on that term by the guidelines.\nI would think that would be a natural reading, in which\ncase you'd look to the conduct of the person.\nAnd if the conduct of the person is such\nthat it calls for a mandatory minimum of a certain kind,\nthere we are. And if that exceeds this amount, there we\nare. You can't apply it. And if it doesn't, you do\napply it.\nMR. HORAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have you looked into that?\nI mean, that was my reading of it as -- in the most\nnatural way. The word \"crime\" is ambiguous. Sometimes\nit means words in a statute. Sometimes it means an\naffair in the world. And I thought this one probably\nmeant the affair in the world.\nMR. HORAN: Well, in answering your\nquestion, Justice Breyer, in answering Justice Scalia's\nquestion, my assumption was that there were, in fact,\nmandatory minimums such that this would play out with\none being greater than the other.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he's disagreeing with\nyou. He -- your theory -- you're not reading \"crime\" to\nmean an affair in the world. You're reading it to mean\na particular prosecution for a particular violation of a\nstatute. Right?\nMR. HORAN: No, that's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I read that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He wants to read it as an\naffair in the world, whatever that means.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If that's so, then this\ngives tremendous power to the prosecutor to decide what\nthe sentence will be in terms of how he manipulates the\ncharge. And I thought that probably this, read with the\nguidelines, is designed not to -- not to permit that.\nIt's to minimize the discretion, not to maximize.\nMR. HORAN: Your Honor, there will be\ncircumstances in which a -- the prosecutor and the\ngovernment, based on how it makes its charging\ndecisions, can affect the floor that's created by the\nminimum sentence.\nIt's a different situation than Deal, which\nwas actually determinant sentences. It's not actually a\ncircumstance where the government can determine the\npunishment itself. That would still be to the district\ncourt.\nBut we maintain that this is the most\nnatural reading. And, in fact, for instance, when this\nconcern came up in Deal, that was to confirm the most\nnatural reading of the plain text. The government would\nactually turn that analysis on its head under these\ncircumstances.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Justice Breyer is\nreading a bit what your co-counsel is advocating, what\nMr. Abbott is arguing?\nMR. HORAN: No, Your Honor. I -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I don't know if it\nmakes any difference. I mean, has there ever been such\na case where the prosecutor worked this in such a way\nthat he would produce this?\nAre you aware if any such case ever\nhappened?\nMR. HORAN: No, I'm -- I'm not aware of\nthat, Your Honor, in part because the \"except\" clause is\n-- there aren't that many instances of the \"except\"\nclause having been actually applied.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And there has never been\nthe incentive to do so, until we accept your\ninterpretation. Then there will be means to do so.\nMR. HORAN: There may be -- Justice Scalia,\nthere may be some incentive do so, subject to other\nconstraints, including the -- the usual practice of\ncharging, for instance, most offenses as they come under\nthe transaction in the same indictment. There will be\ncounterincentives, to be sure.\nYour Honors, for the -- in addition to the\nfact that our interpretation does not involve, we think,\nadding anything into the text that others must, we think\nit establishes -- it advances an evident purpose that\nCongress had in this, which was to ensure that a\ndefendant who is convicted under 924(c)(1)(A) receives\nsome sufficient minimum punishment.\nAfter 1998, the 1998 amendments, section\n924(c)(1)(A) was trafficking, in essence, in minimum\nsentences. And that's what this is about. So this way,\na defendant will receive a sufficient minimum sentence\nby way of 924(c) -- I see that my time is up.\nMr. Abbott will be represented by Mr. Ryan\nat this time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. HORAN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Ryan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES E. RYAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 09-479\nMR. RYAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to spend some time on the second\nquestion in our petition regarding whether other\nfirearms offenses are included within the scope of the\n\"except\" clause.\nBut before I do, I'd like to make a couple\nof points about the first question, which is common to\nour case and to Mr. Gould's.\nJustice Sotomayor asked: Why isn't the\ngovernment's reading the most natural? And the answer\nis pretty simple. The government's reading leaves one\nhalf of the \"effect\" clause with absolutely no practical\neffect.\nThe government has, in its current\ninterpretation, suggested that the \"except\" clause\napplies to one provision of law outside of 924(c).\nThat's 3559(c). And yet with respect to that provision,\nthe \"except\" clause does absolutely no work, both for\npractical reasons and because of the way 3559(c) is\nwritten.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 930(c): A person who\nkills any person in the course of bringing a firearm\ninto a Federal facility shall be punished as provided in\nsections setting forth minimums for murder and\nmanslaughter. So it would also have an effect in\n930(c), no?\nMR. RYAN: It's not clear from the\ngovernment's argument, Justice Sotomayor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I wasn't sure why it\ndidn't list 930(c), but -\nMR. RYAN: As I understand the government's\nargument, the sentence that -- the only sentence that\nwould count outside of 924(c) would be a sentence\nspecifically for a 924(c)(1)(A) offense -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know, but its brief\ndoes two formulations. It says -\nMR. RYAN: Exactly right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- anything that affects\n924(c), and then in other places in its brief, it says\nthe -- the \"except\" clause refers to any higher minimum\nsentence for possessing, using, or carrying a firearm in\nrelationship to a drug or -- drug offense or a crime of\nviolence. Those are two different formulations.\nMR. RYAN: That's exactly right, Justice\nSotomayor. And if the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm focusing on the\nsecond formulation.\nMR. RYAN: Okay. That point actually\ndemonstrates why the government's justification for this\nlimitation doesn't hold up. As the government argues at\none point, the reason to read \"any other provision of\nlaw\" to include only sentences for 924(c)(1)(A) crimes\nis because the \"except\" clause, when it refers to this\nsubsection, refers only to sentences for section\n924(c)(1)(A) offenses.\nYet, that is not the case. As this Court\nindicated in O'Brien, 924(c)(1)(B) is a separate\noffense. Well, if 924(c)(1)(B) can trigger the \"except\"\nclause, and it's not the same offense as 924(c)(1)(A),\nthe government's argument about excluding other offenses\nthat might be separate from 924(c)(1)(A) no longer holds\nup.\nThe other difficulty with the government's\nreading, to go back to the practical point, is that if\nyou apply it just to 3559(c), it can have no effect\nbecause as a practical matter no one can serve a term of\nyears after successfully completing a life sentence,\nwhich is what's required under 3559(c); and 3559(c)\nitself has a provision that, the \"notwithstanding\"\nprovision, that makes clear that only the life sentence\nshould be imposed when 924(c) is the third strike for\npurposes of 3559(c).\nThat, in turn, just leaves future\napplications, and there the government's scenario under\nwhich the language that currently has no effect might\nhave some effect is nothing short of far-fetched. It\nwould require Congress to amend the sentence of\n924(c)(1)(A) outside of 924(c)(1)(A) and not indicate\nhow those two penalties should interact.\nNow, if I could turn to the questions about\na transactional limitation, which we suggest. The point\nof suggesting that the \"except\" clause should be limited\nto sentences for the same transaction is suggested by\nsome of the questions directed to Mr. Gould's counsel.\nWe think that it's the more natural reading of the\nstatute in part because of concerns recognized by this\nCourt in the United States v. Deal, namely that the\nstatute is not designed and should not be read to give\nprosecutors unreviewable discretion as to when the\nminimum sentence in 924(c) ought to be applied or not.\nIt also would preclude the equally odd\nsituation of a defendant being able to benefit from the\n\"except\" clause in a multi-count indictment when the\ndefendant has -- faces a higher mandatory minimum\nsentence for a completely unrelated -- unrelated charge.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where would we look to find\nthe definition of a criminal transaction for these\npurposes?\nMR. RYAN: You could look into 924(c)\nitself. Our view is that it would be no different than\nthe transaction that would give rise to the 924(c)\ncharge itself and so, for that reason, would necessarily\ninclude the predicate offense or another firearms\noffense.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if there were several\n924(c) offenses committed during a rather brief period\nof time? What if on the same afternoon an individual\nengaged in a number of drug trafficking offenses and\nduring each of those used or carried a firearm? Would\nthey -- would they be part of the same criminal\ntransaction?\nMR. RYAN: No. Just as different -\ndifferent transactions can lead to multiple 924(c)\ncharges, which is what happened in Deal, that could also\noccur here.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, you say \"different\ntransactions,\" but I'm looking for the definition of a\ncriminal transaction. The criminal law has labored with\nthis for a long time. It's not a self-defining concept,\nis it, a criminal transaction?\nMR. RYAN: No, it's not, but -- Your Honor,\nbut I don't see how it would be any more difficult to\ndetermine the transaction than to look at what would\nconstitute the 924(c) offense. It would be the same set\nof operative facts that could lead to a 924(c) charge\nwhich would count as the transaction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ryan, I thought that\nyou had three positions, and now you're talking about\nthe second one, which is any greater minimum sentence\narising from the same criminal episode. But I thought\nyour first position was any greater minimum sentence\napplicable to the defendant at sentencing.\nMR. RYAN: That is Mr. Gould's position.\nOur position is limited to the same transaction. Our\nalternative position, which I'd like to turn to now -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Whether charged or\nnot -\nMR. RYAN: Well, the way it would have to\nwork is that there would have to be a previous\nconviction.\nNow, if I could turn to the firearms\nargument. Our argument here is straightforward.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, before you go\non. Your last remark -- it has to be a previous\nconviction. So why doesn't that leave it in the hands\nof the prosecutor whether to bring that conviction, that\nother case, prior or subsequent?\nMR. RYAN: I -- I misspoke, Justice Scalia.\nYou're exactly right. It would include uncharged. It\nwould -- it would prohibit prosecutors from being able\nto use charging instruments to determine whether 924(c)\nwould apply. I was thinking of a particular example,\nbut in the general case, you're right. I apologize for\nthat misstatement.\nNow, if I could just spend a little bit of\ntime on our second question. Our argument here is\nfairly straightforward and fairly modest, and it relies\non the fact that 924(c) is essentially a firearms\noffense. And the punishment provided in the different\nparagraphs in 924(c) are primarily about firearms. And\nso, in looking to determine the meaning of \"any other\nprovision of law,\" it is quite natural, as both the\nFirst Circuit recognized and as the government\nrecognized in Whitley, the Second Circuit case, to\ninclude provisions of law outside of 924(c) that punish\nfirearms offenses.\nNow, to be sure, this particular limitation\nis not commanded by the plain language of the statute\nand rests, like the government's argument, on context\nand purpose. But the difference is that this argument\nstill gives some effect to the \"except\" clause. It\nwould apply, as here, to other firearms offenses outside\nof 924(c) like the Armed Career Criminal Act.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, it gives broader\neffect. It gives broader effect to the \"except\" clause,\nbut the government's argument gives effect to the\n\"except\" clause, doesn't it?\nMR. RYAN: It gives no practical -\nJUSTICE ALITO: 3559(c), which was enacted\nat the same time as this \"except\" clause, wasn't it, and\nmakes explicit reference to -- to 924(c)?\nMR. RYAN: Two points, Justice Alito.\nFirst, the government's reading has no practical effect.\nIt leaves the \"except\" cause with no practical effect.\nYou could take the \"except\" clause away, and there would\nbe no difference in terms of the sentence under 3559(c).\nAs for the enactment of 3559(c), the\ngovernment's argument is actually different. The\ngovernment argues that when 3559(c) was amended to\ninclude possession -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes.\nMR. RYAN: -- it was at that point that the\n\"except\" clause also entered into 924(c).\nThe difficulty with that argument, as we\nexplain in our brief, is that 3559(c) was already linked\nwith 924(c) insofar as both addressed use. And because\n3559(c) and 924(c) were already linked, and the\n\"notwithstanding\" provision within 3559(c) indicated\nthat if the 924(c) offense is your third strike, you get\nthe life sentence, that's it. Well, the fact that\nCongress then amended 3559(c) to make another connection\nwith 924(c) can't possibly explain why there is a sudden\nneed for the \"except\" clause.\nBut the question is an -- is an important\none because it goes to the fact that the government has\noffered three different interpretations of the language\nin this case. The first -- one of the first was in\nWhitley, where it suggested \"any other provision of law\"\nincludes other firearms offenses outside of 924(c),\nprovided that they impose a consecutive sentence. That\nargument was rejected for the idea that, instead,\n924(c)'s \"except\" clause actually applies to no existing\nprovisions of law. And now the Government argues that\nit applies to one, 3559(c), and it has come up with a\nnew theory as to why the \"except\" clause exists in the\nfirst place.\nBut that theory doesn't hold up, and the\ngovernment's shifting interpretations, if nothing else,\nsuggest that the government has not hit upon the most\nnatural reading.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you have offered\nthree different readings, so one can't say that this\nstatutory text has a clear meaning, which I think is\nyour first argument -- that it has a clear meaning. And\nyet, we have Mr. Gould's reading and then the two\nreadings that you've offered us, same episode and same\ngun.\nMR. RYAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. We think\nour first argument is the most natural and the clearest,\nbut I take your point. And the only response I would\nmake is, if shifting interpretations or different\ninterpretations suggest that at the end of the day the\nlanguage is ambiguous and grievously so, under the rule\nof lenity, we ought to prevail. So I'm perfectly\ncomfortable with that conclusion.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. McLeese.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY W. MCLEESE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MCLEESE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nA district court judge in -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, could I just\nask one simple question, the one I started with earlier,\nwhich was, which of the two statements are you\nadvocating? That the \"except\" refers to a provision\nthat imposes a greater minimum sentence for violating\n924(c) explicitly, or are you saying the \"except\"\nclause -- and I'm quoting from your brief, in two\ndifferent places -- the \"except\" clause refers to a\nhigher minimum sentence for possessing, using a firearm\nin relationship to a crime of violence or a drug\noffense?\nMR. MCLEESE: I don't think there needs to\nbe an explicit reference. I think that the \"except\"\nclause is triggered by an offense which has a greater\nmandatory minimum and which has the same elements as and\nis the same offense as a section 924(c) offense.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. If that's\nthe case, your adversary just said, Mr. Abbott's\nattorney just said, that you don't believe that section\n924(c)(1)(A) is trumped by 924(c)(1)(B) or by 18 U.S.C.\nsection 930(c). Is his allegation correct or is he\nwrong?\nMR. MCLEESE: He is incorrect.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay.\nMR. MCLEESE: First, with respect to the\ninternal structure of 924(c), 924(c) as it was amended\nin 1998 is a somewhat complex statute. It has a mix of\nsentencing enhancements and elements which create\naggravated versions of the offense, but it is all a\nsingle offense for double jeopardy purposes, for\npurposes of what punishment to impose. And, therefore,\nthe \"except\" clause operates consistent with the\ndefinition I just suggested quite sensibly and tells a\ndistrict court judge imposing sentence if a defendant\nhas brandished a firearm and also discharged it, you\npick one of the 924(c) menu items, they are all a single\noffense, and you impose a single mandatory minimum\nsentence that is the greatest of those which are\napplicable.\nNow, with respect to 930(c) -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. So that if\nhe discharges a firearm, and it says it is a sentence of\nnot less than 10 years, and he -- and that firearm is\nalso a short-barrelled rifle with a 10 year minimum,\ndoes he get 10 years, or does he get 20 years?\nMR. MCLEESE: He gets 20 years.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How?\nMR. MCLEESE: Because there are -- the\n\"except\" clause says look to your defendant, look to see\nwhich -- whether there is any provision of law which\ncarries with it a greater mandatory minimum which\npunishes the section 924(c) offense. In that instance,\nthere are two. One of them provides for a 7-year\nmandatory minimum; one of them provides a 20-year\nmandatory minimum. The \"except\" clause -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if it was a machine\ngun, where there's a 30-year minimum, does he get 40 or\n30?\nMR. MCLEESE: He gets 30. You always get -\nthe \"except\" clause operates internally to section\n924(c) to tell the district court judge, very helpfully\nin light of the complexity of the provision: You impose\none mandatory minimum sentence for each 924(c)\nviolation, whether aggravated or less aggravated.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's not -- I\ncan't imagine a single district judge getting that\nwrong. To think that, oh, my gosh, here it says 10\nyears if you discharge the firearms, and here it says 5\nyears if you have one, which one do I use in a case when\nit's discharged?\nMR. MCLEESE: That's not -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't need this\nprovision, the -- your argument can't be that this\nlanguage is to make sure the district judge knows in\nthat case to use the 10-year rather than the 5-year.\nMR. MCLEESE: That point, Mr. Chief Justice,\napplies in support of our position, because everyone\nagrees that the primary function, the first half of the\n\"except\" clause, does exactly that. That's all it does.\nIt does nothing else. To the extent -- the \"except\"\nclause says \"except to the extent a greater minimum\nsentence is provided by this subsection,\" the only\nfunction -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that would include (B).\nThat would include (B). (B) is part of the same\nsubsection, isn't it?\nMR. MCLEESE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, you know, I -- I think\nwhat the Chief Justice says is very obvious when you are\njust talking about (c)(1)(A), but it isn't obvious to me\nthat if -- if the firearm is discharged and in addition\nit's a machine gun or destructive device, that you'd\nonly get -- you'd only get the 30 rather than the 30\nplus 10.\nMR. MCLEESE: Quite so. And the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That isn't obvious to me.\nAnd -- and the \"except\" clause would -- would handle\nthat.\nMR. MCLEESE: Correct. And it's important\nto realize when -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I would have\n-- I guess things are obvious to different people. I\nwould have thought it would be odd to say when there are\nincreased minimums that the highest minimum applicable\nisn't the one that applies.\nMR. MCLEESE: I agree with that, but it's\nimportant to realize that another issue that a district\ncourt judge might confront is whether you should\ncumulate them. So it should be, as Justice Sotomayor's\nquestion suggests, that if there are several available,\nthat you get 20 because it's a machine gun and 10\nbecause it was discharged. And from the perspective of\nbusy district court judges, a provision which says, in\nfiguring out how to sentence a 924(c) offender, you\ndon't have to look through this complex statute to\nfigure out what your sentencing enhancements, do some\ndouble jeopardy analysis; all you need to do is simple\nmath. You are directed to look to, of all the ones that\nare available, the one that is longest of the mandatory\nminimums.\nThe point I was trying to make, though,\nMr. Chief Justice, is all of this, the idea that it\nreally isn't that critical even to clarify in the first\nhalf of the \"except\" clause what to do, is consistent\nwith our position, which is the \"except\" clause all\ntogether, both internally to section 924(c) and as it\nreaches externally, is about clarifying something that,\nit may be true, district court judges otherwise would\nhave been able to figure out, had they done a lot of\nanalysis. But it makes it much simpler, and the\npractical utility of it is to clarify a sentencing\njudge's options with respect to a statute that had been\nmade much more complex.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your main -- the\nmeat of your argument focuses on 3559(c), right? There\nis this significant provision out there that does\nprovide a greater mandatory minimum. And I just don't\nsee, as a practical matter, why people would worry about\nthat. Under 3559(c), you get life. And you're saying,\nwell, they put in the \"except\" clause to be sure that\nthe judge would add another 5 years at the end of a life\nsentence.\nMR. MCLEESE: Mr. Chief Justice, I think the\neffect of the \"except\" clause is the opposite, which is\nit makes sure that a judge imposes only life and does\nnot add additional sentences.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, exactly. Yes,\nI'm sorry.\nMR. MCLEESE: And I agree, from the\nperspective of a defendant, that may not be most\nconsequential. But this is a provision which, taken as\na whole, was clarifying, not just externally to 924(c),\nbut also internally, what district court judges should\ndo with a complex menu -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well, just so\nI make sure I understand, the basic point you're making\nis that there are some things under your reading that\nthis deals with. One is the internal point, and we can\ndisagree as to whether that's necessary or not, and the\nother is 3559(c), where it seems to me it doesn't make\nany difference whether you're in there for life or life\nand the additional 5 years.\nMR. MCLEESE: I agree, it's not practically\nsignificant to a defendant, although sentences of life\nplus additional terms or consecutive life are not at all\nuncommon in the code. But it is of significance to\ndistrict court judges, who are trying to figure out what\nsentence to impose. And this provision -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do you do with\n930(c)? Don't leave without answering my question.\nMR. MCLEESE: Yes. I do not interpret\n930(c) as subject to the \"except\" clause. I believe it\nis a separate offense with different elements, and under\nthe double jeopardy analysis that would apply, it is\npossible -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But your answer to me\nwas you read the \"except\" clause as applying to any\nhigher minimum sentence for possessing, using, or\ncarrying a firearm in relationship to a drug offense or\ncrime of violence. Isn't killing a person a crime of\nviolence?\nMR. MCLEESE: Yes. Although 930(c) does not\n-\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And isn't the bringing\nof a firearm into a Federal facility the carrying of a\nfirearm?\nMR. MCLEESE: Yes. Although 930(c) does not\nrequire the killing of a person, it extends to\nattempts -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is 930(c)? Can you\ntell me where it is in the -\nMR. MCLEESE: I don't believe -- it is\nreferred to only in Petitioner Abbott's brief at a page\nnumber I don't recall. It's not one of the provisions\nthat -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, but I'm still trying\nto understand your position, which is -- I read what you\nsaid to me the \"except\" clause means, and I'm applying\nit to 930(c), and I couldn't figure out why you didn't\nlist it.\nMR. MCLEESE: Because 930(c) does not\nrequire an actual killing of a person. It extends to\nconspiracy and attempt. And, therefore, one can violate\n930(c) without violating 924(c) and vice versa. And,\ntherefore -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How?\nMR. MCLEESE: By conspiring -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A person who kills any\nperson -\nMR. MCLEESE: -- or by attempting to do so.\nSo 930(c) has a broader reach because of these vicarious\nand inchoate forms of liability. So a defendant could\nbe convicted separately of 930(c) and of 924(c). They\nare not the same offense for double jeopardy -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So there are two possible\nreadings now of the \"except\" clause where it says -- the\nwords are this subsection doesn't apply where a\nmandatory -- where any other provision of law sets forth\na higher mandatory. Now, one possible reading, which is\nyours, is what this means is that, judge, where you are\noperating under that provision you just mentioned, and\nyou're going to -- the guy has committed two serious\n924(c) things and so he is entitled to life -- this is\njust what the Chief Justice said -- this is done to\nremind the judge don't give him life plus 25 years,\nbecause it would be 25 years under this statute, not 5.\nThat's one possible reading.\nThe other possible reading is, judge, where,\nin fact, you have a pretty -- you have the underlying\ndrug offense that's going to get you up into the 30s and\nit's -- you know, in the guidelines, it's going to be\nprobably 10, 5 years, or whatever it is. You have a\npretty high drug offense already. And now we give him 5\nextra years, say, for having a gun under this, unless\nhe's already gotten, say, a mandatory minimum of 7\nyears.\nAnd if he's already gotten the mandatory\nminimum of 7 years, here's what's happening: Judge,\nturn to the guidelines, and the guidelines will tell you\nto add 3 or 4 extra years. So in one -- that -- those\nare the two possible readings.\nNow, the first reading to me makes very\nlittle sense. The second reading to me says, yes, this\nis serving a purpose. It's once you're sure this guy\nhas to go to jail for 5, 6, 7, maybe 10 or 20 years for\nsure, extra amounts are controlled by the guidelines,\nwhich is administered by a judge.\nNow, if you just came across that for the\nfirst time, which would you think was most probable.\nMR. MCLEESE: Well, I think when you place\nthis in the context of the 1998 amendments that enacted\nthe \"except\" clause, it is quite clear that the former\nis more plausible. And the reason I say that, there are\nreally five features of the 1998 amendments that\nillustrate that the \"except\" clause is not to be read as\neliminating any sentence for a section 924(c) offense,\nbut rather is clarifying which sentence to impose.\nThe first is that the 1998 amendments,\nsetting aside the \"except\" clause for a moment, in every\nrespect substantially increased the scope and severity\nof section 924(c). It changed what had been mandatory\nsentences to mandatory all the way to life. It -- it\nresponded to this Court's decision in Bailey by\nincreasing the substantive scope of the provision. It\nincreased the -- it created increased mandatory minimums\nfor 7-year and 10-year offenses.\nSo it would be odd to think that in the\nsecond half of a presumptively narrow exception clause,\nCongress at the same time ran in the direct opposite\ndirection and had a substantial rollback of pre-existing\nsection 924(c) sentencing provisions. And that's -- to\nbe clear, at the time of the 1998 amendments, these\nPetitioners would have been subject to the mandatory\nminimum sentences that they received. They would have\nbeen subject to 10 years in one of the cases for the\ndrug offense and 5 additional years mandatory and\nconsecutive under 924(c). For the other, they would\nhave -- he would have been subject to 15 years for being\na felon in possession and an armed career criminal and 5\nadditional under 924(c).\nSo one of the features that is key is\nputting this in the context of the 1998 amendments,\nwhich were in every respect -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, but it -- but it\ndoes -- it does subject them to less, at least with\nrespect to those -- those enhancements set forth within\nthe subsection itself.\nMR. MCLEESE: That is true, but that is not\na rollback of pre-existing provisions. It's a way of -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why?\nMR. MCLEESE: Because none of -- in prior\n924(c) law, there wasn't a body of law that would have\ngiven anybody who would get the benefit of the \"except\"\nclause under 924(c) a higher sentence. What -- all the\n\"except\" clause does is it makes clear under this more\ncomplicated scheme that when we are increasing these\nprovisions, a 7 or a 10, you shouldn't telescope them\nall inside 924(c). You shouldn't add them all together;\nyou pick the highest.\nAnd so it -- the \"except\" clause is not a\nrollback. It is a way of accommodating and giving clear\ndirection to the complexity of the newly enacted\nprovision. And -\nJUSTICE BREYER: When -- when did Congress\npass the statute that they amended in 1998? The one\nwith -- you're saying -- I mean, it's a good point. You\nhave a point, that this would make it more lenient, the\ninterpretation. But the \"it\" was passed when?\nMR. MCLEESE: Well, section 924(c) in its\noriginal form I think was passed in the 1960s.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that's way before the\nguidelines. So what they are trying to do now is the -\nin 1998, is they're trying to -- see, in 1998 what\nthey're trying to do is take some of these old\nprovisions and reconcile them with this new system that\nhas come along. So I agree you have a point there.\nBut it -- it does make a certain amount of\nsense, because what it is saying is, in these cases\nwhere you have a whoppo mandatory minimum anyway, so\nyou're sure he's got it; now, the additional amount will\nbe controlled by the guidelines, which are subject to\nnot much discretion. They are pretty close to mandatory\nminimums, but there's a little wiggle room.\nMR. MCLEESE: On the general approach of\nCongress under 924(c), it also bears note that in the\nlast 25 years Congress has amended section 924(c) six\ntimes, and setting aside for a moment the \"except\"\nclause, in all of those amendments Congress has\nuniformly expanded its scope or increased the severity\nof sentences. So the \"except\" clause would be the sole\nprovision in which Congress rolled back section 924(c).\nAnd there are several other features of the 1998\namendment that make clear that that is not what Congress\ndid.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you answer\nMr. Ryan's argument that you can read it this way, you\ncan read it that way; therefore, he wins under the rule\nof lenity?\nMR. MCLEESE: Well, this Court's cases make\nclear that the rule of lenity comes into play at the end\nof the analysis only if there is grievous ambiguity\nafter all the considerations of statutory construction\nhave been considered. We haven't yet discussed all of\nthem, and I think when all of them are discussed, there\nis no grievous ambiguity. In fact, the reading that we\nsuggest is the only reasonable reading, all factors\nconsidered.\nAnd if I can turn back to a couple of other\nfeatures of the 1998 amendments, another feature is\nthe -- the title of the act itself, which is an Act to\nThrottle the Criminal Use of Guns. And, again, it's\njust inconsistent with the provision that has these\nfeatures and has that act, that it would be a\nsubstantial important decrease in the mandatory minimum\nsentences applicable to a large class of -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's a\ndifficult -- you're saying, because Congress wanted to\nget tough on the people who use firearms in this\nprovision, every ambiguous clause should be read in a\nway that makes it tougher on the criminal defendant?\nMR. MCLEESE: I don't -- that would push the\nargument too far. I think it is highly relevant to\nconstruing this -- the statute as a whole, that that was\nthe clear overall function of that amendment.\nNow, there are two other features of the\n1998 amendment, which are, it did as has been previously\nnoted -- also, the only other thing that Congress did in\nthe 1998 amendment, other than modifying section 924(c),\nis it made a corresponding change in section 3559(c) to\n-- to correspond. So we know that section 3559(c) was\nfront and center in Congress's mind as it was enacting\nthe 1998 amendments. And it is very natural, when\nCongress is creating a more complex statute and giving\ndistrict court judges guidance about which mandatory\nminimums to select under that statute, to mention and\nhave language that accommodates the fact that there\nis -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, with respect to\n3559(c) they were in fact being more lenient, not\nstricter, right?\nMR. MCLEESE: No, I think they were\nclarifying -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you said\nearlier that the purpose of this, what it does, is it\nmakes sure that you don't add 5 extra years on the\npeople who are sentenced to life.\nMR. MCLEESE: I think it clarifies the\nrelationship, and, in fact, arguably it could have\nclarified the situation in a way that would have been\nbeneficial to defendants. And the reason I say that is\nwhen Congress enacted the first half of the \"except\"\nclause, which said pick one and only one mandatory\nminimum and impose it -- we're talking internally to\nsection 924(c) -- if it hadn't mentioned 3559(c), there\ncould have been the idea that if there -- if Congress\ndidn't direct the same approach with respect to 3559(c),\nthere's an implication that in fact you should impose\nboth.\nAnd so what it really was doing was\nclarifying what would have been unclear. And it is,\nagain, only half of a presumptively narrow provision\nwhich is just clarifying the relationship -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which is right.\nYou're saying when you get life, or you get 5, just\nserve life; don't serve the extra 5.\nMR. MCLEESE: Yes. Yes, but it's not saying\nthat to defendants. It's saying that to busy district\ncourt judges, who just need to know in a simple, clear\nway what am I supposed to -- what sentence am I supposed\nto -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's the only thing\nthat that additional language which says \"otherwise\nprovided by this subsection or by any other provision of\nlaw\" -- why didn't they just mention 3559(c)?\nMR. MCLEESE: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the only thing it\ncovers, that tiny little thing, which has no effect at\nall, except for the benefit of the busy district judges,\nyou say. I -- I find that quite implausible.\nMR. MCLEESE: Well, remember that it was -\nalthough it is not hugely consequential to defendants,\nit was a provision that Congress was directly\nconsidering then.\nBut there is another function, which is it\ncreates a default rule for future similar provisions\nlike 3559(c). And so there -- and had, again -- so it's\nnot limited to its function with respect to 3559(c); it\nalso serves, as Congress often provides, a default rule.\nAnd so, again, there is a fifth feature of\nthe 1998 amendments for those of whom this is concern,\nwhich is that the legislative history of the provision\nstrongly corroborates our interpretation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, it's not strongly. The\n-- what is it an example? You're saying the other -\nthis thing also serves the purpose that perhaps someday\nCongress will pass a new statute, a totally different\none, and a busy district judge might think that he\nshould add the 5 or 25 years from this provision on to\nwhatever sentence this hypothetical new statute\nprovides, but this will tell him not to do so. Did you\nhave anything in mind?\nMR. MCLEESE: Well, I -- there are -- there\nare other provisions that, like 924(j), which do provide\nsentences for 924(c) offenses that are codified\nelsewhere in the code. And with respect to other\noffenses, that's also quite common. So there's nothing\nimplausible about the idea that -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I take it in those other\noffenses there are other things in the code, and the odd\nthing about this one is there is no other thing in the\ncode except the one we've been discussing. And so I\njust wondered if there -- was there at the time anybody\nthinking of adding some new thing that this might have\nbeen applicable to? Or have you come across anything?\nI take it your answer is no.\nMR. MCLEESE: I'm not aware that -- that\nCongress had some particular pending legislation in\nmind. My point more generally, though, is that it is\nquite common for Congress to provide penalties for\noffense A in a different section, and so creating a\ndefault rule is a perfectly reasonable thing for\nCongress to have done while it was clarifying the\ninternal relationships among the various 924(c)\nprovisions and the provision in 3559(c), which is front\nand center in front of it.\nWith respect to the legislative history, the\n\"except\" clause language was proposed by Senator Jesse\nHelms. In the legislative history of the provision,\nthere is nowhere any comment by anyone suggesting that\nanyone understood it as rolling back pre-existing\nsection 924(c) penalties or as reflecting a new policy\ndifferent from the fundamental policy of section 924(c),\nwhich has always been defendants who commit drug\ntrafficking offenses or violent crimes and who involve a\nweapon will get an additional -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any\nevidence in the legislative history that the reason they\nput this in was to ensure that people who got life would\nnot get life plus 5 years?\nMR. MCLEESE: There's no explicit reference\nto that. But that is, I think, a -- a good inference\nfrom the fact that all of the other explanations are far\nmore implausible.\nAnd there is something -- there are two\nthings which support that inference more specifically,\none of which is, again, that Congress did have in front\nof it section 3559(c) and was amending it.\nThe second is that the sole reference\nanywhere in the legislative history to the \"except\"\nclause is in the testimony of a witness at a hearing,\nand what that witness said about it was that it will\nprevent confusion with other provisions.\nAnd so there is, I think, a -- a strong\nindication -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's one witness at a\nhearing? At a hearing? And you really think that the\nrest of the Congress knew about that hearing?\nMR. MCLEESE: I don't. My point is really\nmore the negative, which is if the \"except\" clause, in\nthe second half of an exception that is in its first\npart intended to clarify, was instead a major policy\nshift from the pre-existing policy of section 924(c),\nadditional mandatory consecutive sentences, and instead\na shift over to sentences which we will try to adjust or\nameliorate in light of other -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. It's a shift\nover to the sentencing guidelines, which say a person\nlike this one will receive an extra 3 or 4 or 5 years\ndepending on the circumstances. Will receive it, just\nlike a mandatory. Unless, of course, it is an unusual\ncase. That's what it's a shift to.\nMR. MCLEESE: Two responses -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Am I wrong?\nMR. MCLEESE: Two responses, Justice Breyer,\none of which is that Congress has amended 924(c) both\nbefore and after this provision, and it's clear that\nCongress is not shifting away from a mandatory minimum\nregime to a regime that -- where the guidelines are\nrelied upon to provide the minimum sentence that\nCongress requires.\nAnd it is a shift not just to a guidelines\nregime, because if this a major policy shift into a\ndifferent world, there -- it poses a question of\nstatutory construction as well, not just about\nguidelines.\nAnd that's the -- the next topic, which\nis -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. I mean, the\nguidelines can't be, as Justice Breyer said, just like a\nmandatory. They can't be, can they?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't say that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, you did. I quoted you.\nMR. MCLEESE: They could not have been, even\nin the pre-Booker world. Certainly, in the post-Booker\nworld, they cannot. But the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Advisory.\nMR. MCLEESE: But -- but the point is that\nCongress -- if Congress was shifting in the \"except\"\nclause, there's a question: What's the nature of that\npolicy shift?\nIf you were going to try to reduce 924(c)\nsentences to accommodate sentences on other provisions\nof law, instead of just making them an add-on always,\nthen there's a question: What policy should you pick?\nShould you pick any other sentence the defendant is\nfacing at this sentencing? Should you pick any other\nsentence arising out of this transaction?\nThat's not a guidelines issue. That's a\nquestion of what is the policy reflected by the statute?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You should pick any\nother violent crime or drug trafficking offense that\nalready provides a higher minimum.\nMR. RYAN: That -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it seems to me\nthe perfectly natural reading is to say, look, we are\nproviding some minimum sentences when this happens, when\nthis is the violent crime and you use a gun, but if you\nhave already got a higher sentence for the violent\ncrime, then this doesn't apply.\nMR. MCLEESE: That is a possible policy, to\nbe sure, but one thing -- it's certainly not the only\nreasonable policy. You could focus on the transaction\nor you could focus on what the defendant is facing at\nthe sentencing. All those are among the policy options\nyou would consider.\nAnd what's interesting is that Petitioners\ncan't agree among those policy options. And they can't\nagree among those policy options because section 924(c)\nhas no guidance about it. And the reason section 924(c)\nhas no guidance about it is because Congress wasn't\nmaking that policy choice at all. Congress was simply\nclarifying how to implement the preexisting policy under\nsection 924(c), which is always impose, for a section\n924(c) violator, an additional separate mandatory\nminimum sentence. But here is advice about how to do\nthat. Here is advice about how to do that internal to\nsection 924(c). Here is advice about how to do that\nexternal to 924(c) under 3559(c) and with a default rule\nfor other similar provisions. That's the -- the modest\nobjective that Congress was attempting to achieve. And\nas everyone agrees -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. For other\nprovisions anywhere in the code? I mean, regardless of\nwhether those provisions are being prosecuted in this\nparticular indictment?\nI mean, you're -\nMR. MCLEESE: No -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying that the\nother side has to say, well, it's only those that are in\nthis -- in this particular criminal transaction, or only\nthose in the particular indictment.\nDo you escape that necessity?\nMR. MCLEESE: I think we do, and the reason\nwe do is because, in our view, this provision operates\nonly when you're talking about prosecution for the same\noffense in double jeopardy purposes. And so it's not\npossible for -- under our submission, for the Government\nto prosecute somebody for one of these variants of\nsection 924(c) and then come back again later and\nprosecute again and manipulate the overall structure of\nsentences, because they are the same offense.\nIf you move outside that into things that\nare not the same offense for double jeopardy purposes,\nthen the prospects do open up for irrational patterns of\noutcome based on the order in which things are\nprosecuted and, in addition, irrational patterns of the\nmandatory minimums based on -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how is your reading\ndifferent than Mr. Abbott's?\nMR. MCLEESE: Mr. Abbott has two readings,\nand our reading differs from each of them. The first of\nMr. Abbott's readings is transactional in nature. Ours\nis focused on the section 924(c) offense itself.\nThe second of our readings is -- the second\nof Mr. Abbott's readings is focused on a firearm, just\nthe fact that a firearm is involved. And, again, ours\nis focused on the use of a firearm in a way that\nconstitutes the section 924(c) offense. So those are\nthe differences.\nBut if I could just point out the other\nanomalies, there are two other anomalies that we have\nnot yet touched upon. One of them is that Petitioners'\nsubmissions create anomalous patterns of floors of\nstatutory minimums, as we've discussed in the briefs.\nIf a defendant under Petitioners'\nsubmission, principal submission, has committed a drug\noffense that carries a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence\nand brandishes a firearm, it is -- carrying a 7-year\nminimum, the floor is 12 years. If that defendant's\ndrug offense is more aggravated and carries a greater\nsentence so that there's a 10-year mandatory minimum,\nthe overall mandatory minimum, under Petitioners'\nsubmission, reduces to 10.\nAnd there is the further anomaly that for\noffenses that are different, Petitioners' submission is\nthat the defendant will end up, although adjudicated\nguilty of a section 924(c) offense, with no sentence\nwhatsoever. There will be a free-floating adjudication\nof guilt. And because the defendant, let's say, is a\nfelon in possession and is sentenced under the Armed\nCareer Criminal Act, when the judge goes to sentencing,\nthe judge, on Petitioners' view, says: I will give you\n15 years under the Armed Career Criminal Act; that\ntriggers the \"except\" clause, and therefore, I impose no\nsentence whatsoever under section 924(c). That also is\nan anomaly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As Justice -- as\nJustice Breyer has pointed out, he can take that into\naccount in figuring out what sentence he would want to\nimpose beyond the greater minimum.\nMR. MCLEESE: That is true. My point about\nthe anomaly is just that it is very strange, to my\nknowledge unheard of, to have a judge go to sentencing\nand have a series of adjudications and to tell the judge\nas to one of them it's not the greater or lesser\nincluded offense of another; you don't even need to\nimpose a sentence on that -- on that adjudication. The\nbackdrop basic assumption is, on each of the\nadjudications, you impose a sentence.\nNow, that's not true if offenses are greater\nor lesser or are the same offense, for double jeopardy\npurposes. But under Petitioners' submission, that is\ntrue with respect to offenses like being a felon in\npossession of a firearm and being someone who violated\n924(c) that are different offenses in double jeopardy\nlaw and have always been given separate judgments,\nseparate punishments.\nIf the Court has no further questions, we\nwould request that the judgments below be affirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. McLeese.\nMr. Ryan, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES E. RYAN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN NO. 09-479\nMR. RYAN: I'd like to make two points on\nrebuttal.\nThere has been a great deal of discussion\nabout the general purpose of 924(c), but as this Court\nhas indicated, the best indication of a statute's\npurpose is the statute's language, and although the\ngovernment argues that the sole purpose of 924(c) was to\nenhance punishment for defendants, the \"except\" clause\nbelies that simplistic assertion of the purpose. The\n\"except\" clause actually mediates the punishment that is\nprovided in 924(c).\nThe government's reading, at the end of the\nday, wants to rely on purpose in order to give no effect\nto the \"except\" clause. The idea that 3559(c) is an\ninstruction to busy district court judges, even putting\naside the impossibility of serving an additional\nsentence after completing a life sentence, doesn't hold\nup, because the government never disputes the fact that\n3559(c) begins with the statement, \"Notwithstanding any\nother provision of law.\"\nSo the busy district court judge never needs\nto turn to the \"except\" clause in 924(c)(1)(A) to know\nthat you impose a life sentence when the third strike is\na 924(c).\nJUSTICE ALITO: Whenever Congress uses a\nphrase like that, \"notwithstanding any other provision\nof law,\" does that mean that Congress must think that\nthere is some provision of law that falls within that?\nMR. RYAN: Possibly, yes, and that -- here,\nthe other provision of law would be 924(c), and so the\npoint would be -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't Congress commonly do\nthat to make sure that something covers any existing\nstatute there might be that would fall within that,\nwithout necessarily saying, well, there are two of\nthem -- if there are two, maybe there are three? Going\nthrough the entire code to find out how many there might\nbe, or if there is any?\nMR. RYAN: Yes, Justice Alito, and that's\nconsistent with my point, is that -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But it's not consistent with\nyour main argument about the \"except\" clause, is it?\nMR. RYAN: Well, yes, it is, because the\n\"except\" clause would also apply to any other provision\nof law.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, but your argument is the\n\"except\" clause has to have some pretty substantial\neffect, or otherwise the \"any other provision of law\"\npart of it -- otherwise, they wouldn't have put it in.\nMR. RYAN: Oh, I apologize. I misunderstood\nyour -- your question.\nThe \"notwithstanding any other provision of\nlaw,\" in the context of 924(c), would not have any\neffect if the \"except\" clause was considered first. But\n3559(c) applies to many other triggering offenses, and\nso with regards to those -- and the government has not\nsuggested that 3559(c) has -- has no effect.\nThe last point I'd like to make is that\nthere's no doubt that regardless of one's view about\nmandatory minimum sentences as a matter of policy, no\none doubts that Congress has the authority, if it\nchooses to exercise it, to stack one mandatory minimum\nsentence on top of another.\nBut as this Court's cases make clear,\nCongress, under the rule of lenity, needs to make that\nchoice clear. And if nothing else, the government's\nshifting views indicate that Congress has not exercised\nthat choice clearly in this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
