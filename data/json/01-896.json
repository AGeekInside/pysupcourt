        "content": "(11:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 01-896, the Ford Motor Company and Citibank v.\nJohn B. McCauley.\nMr. Waxman. The Court would appreciate hearing\nargument on, I'm sure, not just on the question presented\nin the petition for certiorari, but on the question posed\nin the supplemental briefing about whether there is\nappellate jurisdiction where a nominally prevailing party\nin the district court can -- can appeal, and also about\nwhether the question of -- under 1447(d), if this was an\norder of remand, whether the -- the thing was appealable\nto the Ninth Circuit at all.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPerhaps with that observation, I would -- it\nwould behoove me to address the quest -- the appellate\njurisdiction of this Court first, as much as I would like\nto rush into why there clearly is subject matter\njurisdiction in this case, regardless of whether the\nplaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief are viewed as\nseparate and distinct or common and then divide it.\nSo let me first address why I think the Ninth\nCircuit and this Court had appellate jurisdiction, and it\nis straightforward. That is, there is an appeal in this\ncase from the dismissal with prejudice of a consolidated\ncomplaint which was filed voluntarily by the plaintiffs in\nthis case seeking -- as against plaintiffs that are\ndifferent than any -- than the constituent State court\nactions, including different plaintiffs seeking different\ncauses of action and seeking a different form of relief,\nthat is, specific performance of the Ford rebate program.\nAnd it is very clear, both from the cont -- the\n--the four corners of the consolidated complaint and from\nan express representation that my friend, Mr. Berman, made\nat the oral argument in the class certification stage,\nthat the consolidated complaint was filed for the purpose\nof obtaining, in front of Judge Dwyer in the Northern Dis\n-- the Western District of Washington, a judgment on the\nmerits in the case. That is, it was different than the\ntreatment, the maximum treatment, that he would have been\npermitted to provide under the multi-district litigation\npanel's reference. That is --\nQUESTION: What's sort of unusual, though, is\nthat you didn't suffer the dismissal. I mean, yes, a\ndismissal is -- is usually a final -- a final action, and\nit's usually the person whose suit was dismissed who\nappeals --\nMR. WAXMAN: That is --\nQUESTION: -- not -- not the person who\nbenefitted by the dismissal and that --\nMR. WAXMAN: Indeed, and that, Justice Scalia,\nis the -- is the question I believe, the specific\nquestion, that the Court directed the parties' attention\nto in its request for supplemental briefs.\nNow, it is clear that a prevailing party\nnormally cannot appeal, but the operative word that this\nCourt has recognized, at least since the Electrical\nFittings case, is normally. And this Court and the lower\ncourts have applied a rather particular test to determine\nwhen normally doesn't apply, and that is, is the nominally\nprevailing party sufficiently aggrieved by a decision in\nits favor that it retains a, quote, stake in the appeal?\nAnd that's -- that test was articulated by this Court in\nGuaranty Trust v. Roper --\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman.\nMR. WAXMAN: -- and in Forney v. Apfel.\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, a defendant who removes a\ncase and then is remanded is surely aggrieved but,\nnonetheless, cannot appeal. And the problem I have with\nan answer that you went by too fast for me is this case is\nin -- was in the Washington district court for pretrial\npurposes only under 1407. The transfer from the several\ndistrict courts to which these cases were initially\nremoved -- that transfer under the statute was for\npretrial purposes only, not for trial. And after the\npretrial, under the statute, the cases, unless all the\nparties consent, would go back to the district courts from\nwhence they came.\nSo I don't understand how the Western District\nwhich is dealing with a complaint for pretrial purposes\nonly -- I mean, the -- the request that a complaint --\nconsolidated complaint be filed was for pretrial\nprocessing. How do you get from that an action that\ndisplaces all of the other actions that had been removed\nfrom the State court?\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, the appealability\nof the dismissal with prejudice of the consolidated\ncomplaint does not depend on whether the consolidated\ncomplaint, quote, did away with the other actions. The\nreason -- we would, of course, readily concede that under\n1447(d), if all that had happened was a removal of the six\nState court actions, a transfer for pretrial purposes to a\nmulti-district litigation court and a determination by\nthat court that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over\nthe complaints, there would be no appeal because the\nremand of removed State court actions for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction, Congress has decided, is not a\ndetermination that may be reviewed by Federal appellate\ncourts.\nBut here -- and this, I think, is the salient\npoint. Here, the judge did not require the plaintiffs'\nlawyers in the six cases to file some sort of concordance\nor a consolidating document that often is ordered so as to\nfacilitate pretrial proceedings. What the judge said is\nif anybody wants to file a consolidated complaint, they\nmay.\nThe consolidated complaint that was filed in\nthis case avowedly invoked this Court's 13 -- the Federal\ncourt's 1332 jurisdiction and sought not just pretrial\nconsolidated proceedings on discovery and motions, they\nwanted a full trial or a full resolution on the merits.\nIn other words, it's -- it's as if the judge,\nhaving had the six cases transferred, said expressly,\nlook, I'm going to deal with all of the pretrial matters\nthat are the subject of this transfer order, but if you\nall like me --\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, may I stop you at that\npoint? Because the pretrial consolidated -- the order --\nthis is -- I'm looking at the appendix, page 35. It says,\nby order of the multi-district panel, the cases have been\nconsolidated for pretrial purposes only.\nNow, you're saying that there is something --\nsomething that I don't see in the written orders that says\nthey -- no, it's going to be now for trial purposes.\nMR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. I'm -- I'm not\nexplaining myself correctly. The -- the order doesn't say\nthese six removed cases are here for trial purposes, and\nif it did, it would exceed the court's authority under\n1407 and this Court's specific holding in Lexecon.\nOn page 41 of the joint appendix, the court\nunder a heading say -- entitled consolidated complaint\nsays, should plaintiffs in all or some of the consolidated\nactions decide to file a consolidated complaint, you have\nto do so within a certain period of time.\nNow, that raises the question, since they did it\nvoluntarily, whether what they were filing was something\nthat, in essence, sort to -- as I said, to be a\nconcordance, to consolidate in one document all of the\nvarious parties and all the various claims and all various\ntheories so that a court can meaningful and --\nmeaningfully and efficiency -- efficiently manage the\npretrial proceedings.\nQUESTION: But ordinarily you wouldn't go -- go\nabout it that way. You'd have a memorandum, not a\nconsolidated complaint.\nMR. WAXMAN: That -- that's true, Mr. Chief\nJustice, although there are instances where the court --\nwhere the transferee court has ordered the filing of\nsomething called a consolidated complaint.\nBut here, there are two salient -- at least two\nsalient differences. One is this complaint has different\nparties. It has different causes of action. It seeks a\ndifferent type of relief. And at the motion -- and -- and\nit seeks quite clearly, based on the conduct of the\nparties and the representations, this is, in essence,\nsaying thank you very much for having -- having us here\nfor consolidated proceedings on our underlying state court\nactions, but we have decided we like you, Judge Dwyer, and\nwe want you to try a case, and we're going to file a brand\nnew Federal action that is docketed in the Western\nDistrict.\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, things like that,\njuris -- basic jurisdictional thing, agreeing -- this\nwould be a consent to have a court that has no authority\nto adjudicate a case to adjudicate it. Usually such a\nmajor step is done not by inference, not by implication.\nThis is saying, court, even though you have no authority\nunder the Federal statutes to proceed without our consent,\nwe are consenting, so go ahead. We're waiving any\nquestions of venue or anything else.\nThe fact that this is labeled consolidated\ncomplaint is simply what the multi-district statute says.\nIt says that the actions may be transferred for\nconsolidated pretrial proceedings. So why couldn't this\nconsolidated complaint be simply for pretrial proceedings,\nthe only thing that the multi-district panel transferred\nthe case to Western District of Washington for?\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, it certainly\ncould have been, and if it were ordered by the court, that\nis the most that it could have been.\nBut in this case, that's not what it was. There\nare parties, claims, and requests for relief, and\nparticularly the -- what is really the object of the\nlitigation, the request for specific performance of the\nFord rebate program --\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, can I interrupt you with\na question? It seems to me you're, in effect, arguing\nthat the Federal consolidated complaint was kind of a\nbrand new lawsuit, and we forget about everything else\nthat happened before.\nNow, if that were the case and you just had that\ncomplaint filed against you and you filed a motion to\ndismiss and you prevailed and they dismissed the\ncomplaint, it clearly would not be appealable. In order\nfor you to find reasons to appeal, you got to go back and\nsay, well, now we're going to have to face a lot of other\nlawsuits.\nMR. WAXMAN: That -- I think your premise -- the\npremise of your question, Justice Stevens, with respect,\nis incorrect, which is if we had asked for a dismissal on\nsubject matter jurisdiction grounds and prevailed -- that\nis, we would have --\nQUESTION: No. They asked for dismissal on\nsubject matter jurisdiction. No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\nYou're right. You're right.\nMR. WAXMAN: If we had asked for it, then we\nwould have gotten all that we could possibly have\nexpected. What we asked for -- what happened in this case\nwas they voluntarily filed it. They asked for trial and\njudgment on the merits. The court sua sponte said, I\ndon't think I have subject matter jurisdiction, and we\nhave the right to appeal that because we are sufficiently\naggrieved that we have a stake in the case. And the --\nQUESTION: Why did the district court say it had\nno subject matter? Because of the amount in controversy?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, because of the amount in\ncontroversy. It refused to apply -- it followed prior\nNinth Circuit precedent and refused to apply the\ndefendants' viewpoint in a class action seeking\ninjunctive --\nQUESTION: Or you have a brand new --\nQUESTION: You would not have been aggrieved --\nif -- if that was the only case pending and so -- and if\nit was dismissed, how would you have been aggrieved?\nMR. WAXMAN: We would have been aggrieved in the\nsame way -- because what we sought was -- what we wanted\nwas litigation in a single forum, in a forum which had\nalready conducted substantial pretrial proceedings and a\nFederal forum. We sought judgment in our favor on the\nmerits. What we -- which would have produced a dismissal\nor a judgment with prejudice. What we received, but did\nnot ask for, was a result that permits the -- either these\nplaintiffs or anybody else in the country to continue this\nlitigation in State court. And -- and their -- the lower\ncourts in the cases that we've cited are --\nQUESTION: Do you -- do you argue that in just\nan ordinary case if a -- you file -- a defendant files a\nmotion to dismiss both on the grounds of no cause of\naction and so forth and so on and also no jurisdiction,\nyou win on no jurisdiction, you can appeal that?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I think, this Court's\ndecision in Forney v. Apfel stands for that proposition.\nBut it would -- this is an easier case because we did not\nseek to dismiss this for subject matter jurisdiction\ngrounds. We wanted to be in Federal court. We were the\nones who removed the underlying State court actions here.\nAs it turns out, they decided they wanted to be in Federal\ncourt too.\nBut there are a long line of cases, and really\nan uninterrupted line of cases, in the lower courts that\nhave interpreted this Court's jurisprudence in Forney and\nGuaranty Trust and Electrical Fittings to mean that where\nthere is a dismissal on -- of State law claims, not on the\nmerits, but for lack of jurisdiction, defendants are\naggrieved in a practical sense. And we've discussed a --\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, I think the problem is\nthose six State court actions that haven't vanished.\nNobody ever dismissed them. And as aggrieved as you are\n-- and I agree that you're aggrieved -- you could not\nappeal from the remand. It seems to me these two, the\ndismissal of the consolidated complaint, the return of the\nactions from which this consolidation originated, that\nthose two are inextricably tied together. And you would\nlike to cut them off and say, Court, just look at the\nconsolidated complaint. Forgot about those separate\nactions. Somehow they vanished.\nMR. WAXMAN: Not -- with respect, Justice\nGinsburg, maybe I -- perhaps I'm not understanding you. I\n-- there's an interesting epistemological question in this\ncase whether the underlying State court actions continue\nto exist or whether they had been, in fact, superseded but\nthe --\nQUESTION: Let -- let me ask you about one\nsolution to the epistemological question. Let's assume --\nlet's assume that on the remand the State courts think\nthey are still alive. Are you going to the State courts,\nlet's try them now? Hear us immediately. We want a\ntrial.\nMR. WAXMAN: You mean --\nQUESTION: You're not going to do that. What\nyou're going to say is, defer any action here, if you win\non this -- on your point here. You're going to say, defer\nany action so we can try the Federal case.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nQUESTION: And -- and that it seems to me,\nunless I am missing the point of what you are necessarily\ngoing to do, it follows that -- that the -- that the\nFederal case is, in fact, simply the alter ego of the\nState cases, and if you win here, you are functionally\ndoing nothing but eliminating subsection (d).\nMR. WAXMAN: I -- with respect, Justice Souter,\nif -- there are plaintiffs in two of the State cases who\nare not even named plaintiffs in the Federal case. There\nare defendants. There is a defendant.\nQUESTION: Are they within the class?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, the -- all of the cases seek\na nationwide class.\nQUESTION: Sure, and don't you think those non-\nnamed plaintiffs would be happy to let somebody else carry\nthe ball for them in -- in the Federal action?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nQUESTION: They're -- they're not going to fight\nyou when you say to the State courts, just let them sit\nhere until we get the Federal case taken care of.\nMR. WAXMAN: There are -- I'll go to door number\ntwo. There are claims. There are causes of action in the\nunderlying State cases that are not included in the\nconsolidated complaint and vice versa. In short, the --\nthe -- from a case management perspective, whether both a\nFederal case and a State case that are both in existence\ncan go forward simultaneously or whether one should follow\nthe other is something that happens all the time, and it\nhas never been understood to divest one court or the other\nof jurisdiction. And our submission here is that we have\nsomething that is distinctly new. It was --\nQUESTION: The consolidated complaint?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: No, but I mean, you -- but our point\nis if functionally you are going to treat this as the alt\n-- the equivalent, the alternative to all of these State\nactions -- and you have told me nothing to suggest that\nyou're not going to do that -- then it seems to me that\nthe -- the -- the argument has got to prevail that\nfunctionally this in -- in fact is nothing but an end run\naround the non-appealability of the remand.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, in point of fact, Justice\nSouter, if this Court reverses the Ninth Circuit for the\n-- for -- for one of the two errors of law that it\ncommitted, and on remand, the conclusion is made that\nthere is subject matter jurisdiction and the case can\nproceed, we will be in precisely the same posture that we\nwere in at the time that the plaintiffs filed the\nconsolidated complaint.\nQUESTION: No, because at that time the --\nthe -- the State cases had been remanded.\nMR. WAXMAN: And -- well, the State cases have\nnot yet been remanded, but if the State --\nQUESTION: I -- I mean -- I'm sorry. They had\nbeen -- they had been removed. I misspoke.\nMR. WAXMAN: They had been removed.\nQUESTION: They had been removed.\nMR. WAXMAN: And they will remain removed if\nthis -- if a Federal court concludes that there is subject\nmatter jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: I thought that the order of the\nWestern District of Washington was that the State cases\nare remanded.\nQUESTION: That's what I thought.\nQUESTION: And that the Ninth Circuit did not\ntouch that, that the Ninth Circuit dealt only with the\nconsolidated complaint.\nMR. WAXMAN: There is a single order in the case\nthat says there is no jurisdiction. And it's in the -- in\nthe joint appendix. There is no subject matter\njurisdiction over the consolidated complaint or over the\nsix removed actions. And therefore, the consolidated\ncomplaint is dismissed, and the clerk is directed to\nremand the underlying State actions back to the States.\nNow, that order was stayed by the Ninth Circuit at our\nrequest pending the outcome of this case. That is, if --\nQUESTION: Well, but stayed by the Ninth Circuit\nprior to argument there?\nMR. WAXMAN: No. After -- yes, it was stayed\nprior to argument there and --\nQUESTION: Well, didn't that stay expire with\nthe decision of the court of appeals?\nMR. WAXMAN: It would have except that we moved\nfor a stay of the mandate. The mandate issued before the\ncourt ruled on it, and the court then recalled the mandate\nand directed that the remand of the underlying State\nactions not proceed until this Court -- at least until\nthis Court -- has resolved the question. But\nultimately --\nQUESTION: But I still think -- I still think\nyou're in trouble because even if we accept your -- your\nreading of what the -- the court ordered and what it's\nlikely to do if you prevail here, it simply changes the\ncharacterization of what's going on. You're -- you're\nsaying that the -- that if the -- if the consolidated case\nstays in the Federal court, it does not die, and in fact,\nbecause of that, there is no remand. Then it simply\nfollows that the consolidated course is a trump to the\nremand and you're excluding the operation of subsection\n(d) in a slightly different way.\nMR. WAXMAN: Not true, Justice Souter, for two\nreasons. I'll give the broader one first.\nIf we had filed as all parties in the case and\nthe Solicitor General as well agree is the complete\nfunctional equivalent of the consolidated complaint -- if\nFord and Citi had filed a declaratory judgment action in\nFederal court, even after the State cases had been filed,\nbefore or after they had been removed, and we asked for a\ndeclaration that we can terminate the Ford rebate program,\nthere would be no question that --\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, give me an example of any\ncase in which a defendant in a product liability suit, in\na credit suit like this one, a defendant has said I want\nto preempt the class action and so I am going to bring\nthis declaratory suit against all the credit card holders\nof this plan all over America in the forum that I choose,\nand that's going to be where the class action is going to\nproceed. Can you give me any precedent for a defendant\nbeing able to take over what would have ordinarily been\nthe plaintiff's product liability claim, credit card\nclaim? I -- I don't know of any such case where a\ndefendant has been allowed to make such a case its show\nrather than the plaintiff's show.\nMR. WAXMAN: I -- as I'm standing here, Justice\nGinsburg, I -- I can't bring any cases to mind. I'll --\nI'll -- I'll -- I'll try and bring one to mind prior to my\nrebuttal.\nBut I don't understand what the objection would\nbe if, before terminating the program, we said, we're\ngoing to terminate this program --\nQUESTION: Because you have --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- and we want a declaration\nthat --\nQUESTION: Because, Mr. Waxman, you have\npotential plaintiffs from all over the country. Normally\na lawsuit is begun by a plaintiff and the plaintiff's\nchoice of forum is respected. Here you are saying a\ndefendant, not dealing with one plaintiff, but dealing\nwith hundreds, maybe thousands -- I don't know how many\ncredit card holders there are -- across the country can\nstart the lawsuit and a Federal court would listen to\nthat, would, at the defendant's urging, somehow certify\nthe plaintiff class. I don't know of any such action. I\ndon't know of any district judge who has done that at the\nurging of a defendant.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, if we were\nto have filed such a case -- and my submission is it would\nbe the functional equivalent of a consolidated complaint\n-- it would not disempower plaintiffs or plaintiffs'\nrepresentatives from filing their own class actions in\nState or Federal court. And if that were the case, there\nwould then -- there would be -- thereafter be a\ndetermination made by the courts involved --\nQUESTION: Well, in any case you said it --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- as to whether it makes sense --\nQUESTION: It doesn't occur to you that there is\nsuch a case, but --\nMR. WAXMAN: I am -- I am sure that there are\nmany such cases. I can't cite you one as I'm standing\nhere.\nQUESTION: Where defendant starts the action as\na declaratory action and a class gets certified on the\nplaintiff's side.\nMR. WAXMAN: That's correct. I -- I know that\nour brief and the red brief and the Solicitor's General\nbrief all address this scenario, but I can't bring to mind\nthe cases.\nBut just to get back to Justice Souter's\nquestion again, let me give you the ex -- in terms of\nwhether, if we proceed here, a State case could go forward\nand -- and would go forward, If you take, for example,\nthe Alabama case where there's no Alabama plaintiff here,\nthey have not only not sought specific performance, they\nhave disavowed any specific performance and brought\nseparate claims on different theories. Since they haven't\nsought specific performance, there is no subject matter\njurisdiction over the claim because we are -- and this\nCourt basing subject matter jurisdiction on the cost of\nproviding that performance -- the Alabama case can and\npresumably will go forward.\nQUESTION: Will it go forward without your\nobjection? Are you representing that -- that you will\nwalk into the Alabama court and say, sure, we're ready to\ngo ahead?\nMR. WAXMAN: Under this -- yes. Under this\nCourt's -- under the Court's current jurisprudence, yes,\nwe would. The only -- it would only be if this Court were\nto resolve the question it left open in Free v. Abbott\nLabs that we would then have some argument, or that the\nCourt determined that punitive damages could be\naccumulated. But since they aren't asking for a specific\nperformance -- and neither, by the way, are I think four\nother of the six cases. Since they're not asking for a\nspecific performance, we don't have an argument under this\nCourt's existing case law for keeping the cases there.\nAnd they could --\nQUESTION: How many -- how many -- I'm sorry,\nbut how many other cases like the Alabama case are there?\nIn other words, you -- you say, okay, we'll litigate in\nAlabama. Any others?\nMR. WAXMAN: I -- I don't know that I have the\n-- all of the details of the underlying cases in mind.\nBut if they are simply a claim for damages and punitive\ndamages in which the amount in controversy is not $75,000,\nand they aren't asking for specific performance, I don't\nthink, consistent with the law of this case, we would have\nany basis for objecting to them going forward.\nQUESTION: They all ask for compensation. There\nare none of them that ask just for specific performance,\nand -- and even in this consolidated complaint, the first\nthing that they ask for is compensatory damages.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, it's -- it is clear, Justice\nGinsburg -- and if it isn't clear from the complaint, it\nis utterly clear from the -- from the plaintiffs' red\nbrief in this case at page 45 that what they -- the object\nof this litigation is reinstatement of the national Ford\ncredit rebate program under which they can earn credits\ntoward the purchase of a Ford vehicle.\nThey -- they're -- they don't -- none of these\nplaintiffs have a liquidated claim for damages because\nthey're not asking that they be paid rebates that they\nearned and weren't paid. Those were credited to them.\nThey are all asking for reinstatement of a program, which\ndoesn't exist, that will allow them to earn credits, based\non purchases, toward the purchase of a vehicle.\nAnd on the -- on the question of subject matter\njurisdiction, the court below made two errors of law.\nFirst, it held incorrectly that class actions joining\nseparate and distinct claims for injunctive relief cannot\nbe viewed from the defendants' -- cannot be valued from\nthe defendants' viewpoint. And secondly, it erred in\nconcluding that the plaintiffs' interest in specific\nperformance cannot be viewed as common and undivided.\nAnd if the Court has no questions at this time,\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time and perhaps\naddress the merits on rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Waxman.\nMr. Berman, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE W. BERMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. BERMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI will turn to the question that's taken the\nbalance of the argument so far and that is whether this\nCourt has jurisdiction. And I do so with the same\nreluctance that Mr. Waxman did because the underlying\nquestion is an important question that has troubled courts\ndealing with class actions for some time now.\nBut despite the fact that I'd like the Court to\nanswer that question, I don't think there was jurisdiction\non appeal or -- or before this Court because it's quite\nclear that no matter how you artfully look at this, this\nis a simple situation that's subject to 1407(c) and (d)\nwhich this Court has said commands -- and that's in the\nGrauded case -- unmistakably commands that where there is\na remand, based on the lack of subject matter\njurisdiction, that that's not reviewable.\nQUESTION: I -- it was your clients, Mr. Berman,\nwho filed the consolidated complaint in the Western\nDistrict, I take it.\nMR. BERMAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And who was it that moved to dismiss\nthat complaint?\nMR. BERMAN: No one moved to dismiss that\ncomplaint. The court, after consideration of class\ncertification, wrestling with -- I think with the laws of\nthe various different States that were invoked by that\nmotion, said to us, I'm issuing an order to show cause why\nI shouldn't, on my own motion, dismiss this case for lack\nof jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: And did he -- on the subject matter\nground that there's not -- not $75,000 in controversy?\nMR. BERMAN: That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMR. BERMAN: And then we briefed that issue and\nthe judge dismissed the case in response to the briefing\non the order to show cause.\nQUESTION: And that was before there was any\ncertification. You didn't get up to any certification of\nany class, did you?\nMR. BERMAN: Justice Ginsburg, that was -- the\nanswer is yes. It was before. We were in the midst of\nthe class certification hearings. We had two or three\nhearings. No class had been certified, and I think, as I\nsaid earlier, that in the process of wrestling with the\nvarious State laws, the district court scratched his head\nand said, why is this case before me?\nQUESTION: Now, as I understand Mr. Waxman's\nposition, it is that the consolidated complaint is a new\nFederal action. To be sure, the effect of the district\ncourt's order being appealed here and being reversed may\naffect -- may control the remand of the cases that were\nbeing held. But this action must be looked at on its own\nas a Federal action. True, one of the proximate causes of\nour retaining the action by saying that there is\njurisdiction may defer the remand of those other cases.\nTrue, that looks like something of an end around the no\nappealability for remand, which is the express command of\nthe Congress. But we have here a separate case and we\nhave to look just at that separate case.\nNumber one, am I understanding his argument\ncorrectly? And number two, what is your response?\nMR. BERMAN: I think you are understanding his\nargument correctly, but I submit that he's incorrect.\nIt's not a new case. As one of the Justices pointed out,\nthere's no authority under the MDL rules for us to just\nsay this is a whole new case.\nQUESTION: Well, who filed the -- the\nconsolidated complaint? Your -- presumably you did.\nMR. BERMAN: I did, Your Honor, and if you read\nJudge --\nQUESTION: And it had different parties and\ndifferent complaints than -- than the separate State\nactions.\nMR. BERMAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Why did you file that consolidated\ncomplaint in that fashion? It was before the district\ncourt as part of a pretrial situation in a multi-court\njurisdiction problem.\nMR. BERMAN: It is not uncommon in MDL practice\nfor pretrial purposes to try to organize the pleadings for\nthe district judge in a consolidated complaint. In fact,\nI -- I can't think of any MDL case I handle --\nQUESTION: But didn't it do more than just\norganize the pleadings? Didn't it change parties and\ncauses of action and look like a whole new ball of wax?\nMR. BERMAN: Well, there were some\nrepresentative changes because after all the lawyers\nacross the country got together for the first time,\nbecause we were thrown together, some of those lawyers\nsaid, if you're going to move for class certification of a\nnationwide class in one of these State court cases, maybe\nmy representative doesn't need to be there because there's\nfive other representatives. So for consolidation purposes\nand for organizational purposes, we streamline and we try\nto be as organized as we can. That doesn't mean we've\nabandoned the cases underlying below. We -- we did not.\nQUESTION: It's not a question of abandonment.\nIt's a question of which one takes precedence. There's\nnow a Federal case which Mr. Waxman's argument is takes\nprecedent. We just hold everything else until this one is\ndone.\nMR. BERMAN: Well, there's a Federal case for\npretrial purposes, and the judge, Judge Dwyer of the lower\ncourt, found he had no jurisdiction anymore over that case\nwhich is proceeding in Federal court. But it's a\ndiversity case asserting State law claims. So it's not,\nquote, a Federal case. It's been removed, and once a\ncourt determines that there's no jurisdiction, it's no\nlonger a Federal case.\nQUESTION: Mr. Berman, Mr. Waxman points out\nthat you have submitted an entire complaint. It doesn't\nlook like a pretrial-only complaint. It's a -- it's a\ncomplete complaint that has a prayer for relief. So it\nlooks like a different action. And he said by filing such\na complaint, you in effect waived any objection to the --\nto the multi-district forum going on to dispose of the\nwhole case, not just pretrial.\nMR. BERMAN: Well, to answer that, Justice\nGinsburg, the pretrial order that Mr. Waxman cited to and\nI think that you cited to as well said that the\nconsolidated complaint was to be filed for pretrial\npurposes only. There was no waiver in the record that we\nfiled. The judge didn't order that we submit such a\nwaiver. And I don't know that I have the authority as a\nlawyer to alter the MDL rules. The MDL rules don't\nprovide that I can decide on my own that the case will\nproceed for all purposes forever in front of Judge Dwyer.\nAnd -- and yes, the complaint --\nQUESTION: Where does it say that? For pretrial\npurposes only.\nMR. BERMAN: It's in the --\nQUESTION: I mean, the judge says on page 41,\nshould plaintiffs in all or some actions decide to file a\nconsolidated complaint, that complaint shall be filed\nwithin 15 days. And then the complaint itself doesn't say\nit's for pretrial purposes only.\nMR. BERMAN: No, it does not, Your Honor, and\nthe judge didn't mandate that we do it. He said, should\nyou.\nQUESTION: But in Lexecon, we said that the\njudge who -- to whom it was referred for pretrial --\ncouldn't try the case unless both parties consented,\ndidn't we?\nMR. BERMAN: Yes, you did. And there's --\nthere's nothing in this record other than the complaint.\nIf you read from the complaint consent, that's the only\nthing in the record that you could draw that we consented\nto Judge Dwyer trying this case for all purposes.\nQUESTION: Could -- could you come back to my\nquestion? Where -- you -- you say that the complaint was\nonly filed for pretrial purposes. On -- on what do you\nbase that?\nMR. BERMAN: I base that on my understanding of\nMDL practice. I mean, we didn't say we're filing this for\ntrial purposes. We didn't say we're filing it for\npretrial purposes.\nQUESTION: You filed a complaint. I mean, you\nfile a complaint --\nMR. BERMAN: In MDL practice, I submit, Justice\nScalia, that you do file a complaint of some form that\nbrings all these plaintiffs from all over the country\ntogether. I can't think of an -- an MDL case, whether it\nBrand Name Prescription Drugs or the various cases that\nare pending involving the pharmaceutical industry, for\nexample, where a consolidated complaint of -- of removed\nState court cases is not put together in some fashion.\nQUESTION: That's true, but does it normally --\nis it normally just look like an ord -- your complaint\nlooks like an ordinary complaint. It names four people.\nIt says we're bringing a case. It's diversity\njurisdiction. It's quite clear, I think, there's venue.\nAnd -- and that's it. It looks like a normal complaint.\nSo is it ordinary MDL practice that what happens\nwhen you transfer things for pretrial proceedings, the\nlawyers get together and file what to the naked eye looks\nexactly like a normal complaint, as if they marched into\nFederal court on day one and filed a complaint? Is that\nnormal MDL practice?\nMR. BERMAN: I think it is very typical --\nQUESTION: How do I verify that?\nMR. BERMAN: I could submit my supplemental\nrecord --\nQUESTION: No, no. Not your -- I mean, is there\nsome -- I guess I could look it up in a book on MDL\npractice.\nNow, on MDL practice, when you finish, as I read\nthe rules, it says the transferee judge can reach a\njudgment. But if he doesn't get to a judgment that\nfinishes the case, he's supposed to send it back to the\ntransferor districts, not the State court, but back to\nseveral transferor districts. Is that what happened here?\nMR. BERMAN: It never got there because --\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. BERMAN: -- that -- the order of remand,\nboth by the district judge and the Ninth Circuit, was\nstayed.\nQUESTION: No, but was the order of remand the\n-- an order to send it back not to the States but to the\nFederal transferor districts?\nMR. BERMAN: Actually I think the language of\nthe order is that the cases are remanded back to the State\ncourts.\nQUESTION: To the State courts.\nMR. BERMAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: That must be wrong, mustn't it?\nMR. BERMAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: It should go to the transferor\ndistricts.\nMR. BERMAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And there also -- it says\nspecifically and that is pursuant to the MDL order, which\nwe can review, can we not?\nMR. BERMAN: Yes, you can.\nQUESTION: Okay. So we would have the power in\nthis case to review what should have been the Ninth\nCircuit's order remanding the case to the transferor\ndistricts, even though they said it wrong.\nMR. BERMAN: If you -- if you took jurisdiction\nunder that scenario --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. BERMAN: -- in all due respect, you would be\nviolating both the spirit and the intent --\nQUESTION: Not at all. After all --\nMR. BERMAN: -- of 1407.\nQUESTION: Not at all. Not at all. If, after\nall, an order of the MDL panel were to have an underlying\ntheory that there wasn't jurisdiction in some court or\nother under 1447, I don't see why we couldn't by writ, as\nprovided, review it. And our reason for doing it would be\nto solve an important and serious problem of jurisdiction\nthat is plaguing the lower courts. In other words --\nQUESTION: Mr. Berman, you don't want us to\nreview an order that never existed, do you?\nMR. BERMAN: I'm not sure --\nQUESTION: You wouldn't want us to -- to review\nan order that should have issued but didn't issue. How\ncould we review an order that never issued?\nQUESTION: No, it did issue.\nMR. BERMAN: There was -- there was an erroneous\norder of the district court. And -- and I submit that --\nQUESTION: I think we can review -- the -- the\nerroneous order is nonreviewable.\nMR. BERMAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: No. There is an order dismissing.\nThere is an order that says remand it to the courts.\nQUESTION: It says remand to the State --\nQUESTION: To the State courts. But that --\nthat isn't what they meant.\nMR. BERMAN: That is -- that is not what he\nmeant.\nQUESTION: All right. That is a problem. I see\nthat as a problem, but I don't know if it's an insuperable\nproblem --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BERMAN: And the problem I have, Justice\nBreyer, is that I would like to agree with your argument\nbecause, as you pointed out, this is something that's\nplaguing the courts.\nQUESTION: All right. The way it would have\nworked if they had gotten -- hadn't said remand to State\ncourts, is they would have sent it back to transferor\ndistricts. Some transferor districts would have agreed\nwith this judge, some would have come to other\nconclusions, and we plainly could have reviewed the ones\nthat came to other conclusions so we could have decided\nthe issue. So is that what you think should happen? What\nshould happen?\nMR. BERMAN: Well, I would like the Court to\nreview the underlying merits, but to do so, I think you\nhave to do some gamesmanship and do injustice to 1407.\nQUESTION: Isn't, Mr. Berman, what --\nQUESTION: Justice Breyer told you that -- said\nthat it would have to go back to the State courts. But\nthe question is what is the it. You have to first dispose\nof the action that was instituted by the consolidated\ncomplaint.\nMR. BERMAN: That was disposed of.\nQUESTION: But that's the only thing we're\narguing about here, and the arg -- and the contention is\nit was improperly disposed of and that it was disposed of\non a basis that injures the defendants and that they can\nappeal that because they're aggrieved under the cases that\nMr. Waxman cites. And that's all we're talking about.\nMR. BERMAN: And I understand that, Justice\nKennedy, but the case that Mr. Waxman cites and the cases\nhe cites for the proposition that an aggrieved party can\nappeal, I don't quarrel with that.\nThe problem with that authority in this case is\nthat none of those cases that he cites are cases where\nthere's been a dismissal, which there was in this case, of\nthe consolidated complaint on the grounds of a lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction. And --\nQUESTION: Mr. Berman, I think something needs\nclarification here. When a district judge in a multi-\ndistrict case like this makes a pretrial order,\ndetermination, decision, and on the basis of that, those\ncases go back to the district courts from whence they\ncame, that ruling is not up for grabs in the individual\ndistrict courts. That is the law of the case that they\nall must follow. And as I understand the Western District\nof Washington decision, that there was no subject matter\njurisdiction, that would not be open for contest in the\ndistrict courts.\nMR. BERMAN: I -- I agree with that. It would\ngo to the district courts pursuant to proper MDL practice.\nWe would move for enforcement of the judge's order\nremanding the case, but we couldn't fight that issue of\nsubject matter jurisdiction because it would have been\ndecided --\nQUESTION: Okay. So -- so that if that had\nhappened -- going back to an answer you gave earlier, if\nthat had happened, and -- and the -- the missing step had\nbeen included and it said, back to the transferor court,\nthe only thing that could have happened with the\ntransferor court, the jurisdictional issue having been\ndecided in the Western District of Washington, would be to\nremand.\nMR. BERMAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Yeah, okay.\nMR. BERMAN: And -- and because of that --\nQUESTION: May -- may I ask? Mr. Waxman pointed\nout to us that this order was actually stayed by the\ndistrict court and by the Ninth Circuit, and I don't find\nthe stay order in the appendix. I'm sure it's in the\nrecord, as he points out. But in connection with getting\nthat stay and the -- the both -- in both the district\ncourt and the court of appeals, did anyone point out to\neither of those courts that the order was defective for --\nfor failing to -- to include the transferor court rather\nthan going direct to the State court?\nMR. BERMAN: No.\nQUESTION: So that just surfaced today.\nMR. BERMAN: It just surfaced today. And -- and\nthe jurisdictional issue just surfaced in response to your\nquestion. No one raised the 1407 issue in any of the\ncourts below.\nI had originally had come to talk about the\nimportant issue.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BERMAN: And I -- I don't know that Mr. --\nQUESTION: Us too.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BERMAN: Mr. Waxman hasn't had time to\naddress that issue. I don't know if the Court wants me to\ngo into that. I have some time remaining.\nQUESTION: I think the Court would like to.\nMR. BERMAN: Very briefly then. This Court has,\nsince the Judiciary Act of 1789 was passed, consistently\nconstrued diversity jurisdiction so as to avoid expanding\nthe Federal caseload. That's the teaching of Snyder v.\nHarris. The proposition that's asserted here today by the\npetitioners that you can use administrative costs in\nsatisfying the amount in controversy would vastly expand\nthe Federal caseload in two ways.\nQUESTION: Is your objection just to the concept\nof administrative costs, Mr. Berman, or to the idea that\nit can be compute -- the amount in controversy can be\ncomputed at all from the defendants' point of view?\nMR. BERMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, my answer to\nthat is I think that the Court could adopt a rule allowing\nthe amount in controversy to be determined from either\nviewpoint, both from the plaintiffs' viewpoint or from the\ndefendants' viewpoint. But that doesn't answer the\nquestion.\nThe -- the question really presented then is how\ndo we value that amount. And this Court's teachings I\nthink have answered that question, and that is in the Hunt\ncase, the Court has ruled and has consistently followed\nthis proposition, that it is well established that the\namount in controversy is measured by the value of the\nobject of the litigation. And so, another way the Court\nhas put it is what right does the plaintiff seek to have\nenforced here. The --\nQUESTION: In a -- in a couple of those quotes,\nyou know, taken out of context, they seem to support your\nposition. They certainly don't controvert your position.\nBut the Court wasn't really faced with the issue here.\nMR. BERMAN: I -- I think the Court has never\nsquarely been faced with the issue of should the\nplaintiff's rule be adopted or not. There is suggestions\nthat it should be, but I think what the Court has been\nconsistent on is looking at the value of the object of\nlitigation from the point of view, what is it that the\nplaintiff wants, not what are the incidental costs to the\ndefendant. In fact, there is a case -- and I -- I know\nit's an old case, but the Ross case and the Elliott case\nsquarely hold that jurisdiction does not depend upon any\ncontingent injuries or damage to a defendant in a case.\nAnd if the rule is otherwise -- and by the way,\nI think there's a big difference, for the purposes of this\nCourt's review, of an administrative cost versus\ninjunctive relief. So let me first focus on\nadministrative cost.\nThe mischief, I think, of allowing\nadministrative cost to be considered is illustrated by an\nearlier Ninth Circuit decision in Snow v. Ford. And there\nthe plaintiff sought an injunction because Ford had sold a\ntrailer package without an $11 wiring kit. And Ford\nargued then, as it does now, that because it would have to\nincur substantial costs in supplying this $11 kit, that\nthere was Federal jurisdiction.\nWell, the value of the object of litigation from\nthe plaintiffs' point of view, if you can't aggregate,\nwhich under Snyder v. Harris you can't, is $11. If the\nCourt is going to allow administrative cost to be\nconsidered, then this Court is going to have hundreds --\nFederal courts are going to have hundreds of $11 cases in\nfront of them.\nAnd I think Judge Posner hit the nail right on\nthe head in the Brand Name Prescription Drug case, in\nwhich he said that if the costs of compliance were\nconsidered, then every case, virtually every case, quote,\nhowever trivial would cross the threshold.\nQUESTION: Why shouldn't they have it if in fact\nit really does cost the defendant the $75,000, however you\ncategorize it? Why shouldn't the Federal courts hear\nthose cases?\nMR. BERMAN: Because consistently this Court has\nlooked at the value of the right to be protected and\nexcluded such incidental costs. The value of the right\nthere --\nQUESTION: There might be a legal argument\nthere, but I thought you were making a policy argument\nthat it was a bad thing.\nMR. BERMAN: Well, I do -- I do --\nQUESTION: And I don't see why that's so if in\nfact in most cases I think that if it's going to cost\n$75,000 for an $11 claim, if it's really just one claim,\nthe defendant will settle it. And, of course, if it's not\nreally just one claim, but really involves class actions\ninvolving many hundreds of claims, that's just what's\nsupposed to be in the Federal court.\nMR. BERMAN: Well, then you'd have to overrule\nSnyder and the non-aggregation --\nQUESTION: There's a legal -- you're making a\npurely legal argument then.\nMR. BERMAN: Yes, which -- which they're not\nadvocating. But from a policy argument, my argument is\nthat you would suddenly thrust the Federal courts in\ndetermination of what basically are State -- routine State\nlaw matters.\nQUESTION: But that's what -- that's what this\nClass Action Fairness Act, which has considerable support,\nthat's pending in Congress -- it's still pending, isn't\nit?\nMR. BERMAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: That's what it would do. It would\nallow -- if -- if the price tag of all these small claims\nfor the defendant was more than the amount in controversy\n-- well, I think it puts a much higher price tag than\n$75,000. But anyway, that -- that's the idea of the class\naction bill that's pending in Congress, to put all these\ncases, to aggregate them if the total dollar amount for\nthe defendant is very high.\nMR. BERMAN: That's correct. That -- it's $2\nmillion, the new proposed limit, and it would allow\naggregation, which this Court so far has not allowed. So\nCongress realizes under existing precedent that what the\n-- Ford wants to do here is not permitted.\nQUESTION: Well, is -- is -- is there a -- is\nthere a distinction to be made along these lines? And I\n-- I may not be able to -- to state what I'm trying to\nwork out in my mind, but here -- here's -- here's the\ndistinction I'm trying to -- to get at.\nLet's assume that the -- that the only issue is\n-- is an issue in one case. They didn't give the $11\ntaillight or whatever it was. And because of the\nbureaucracy of a big company, in order to provide the one\n$11 tail light, it's going to cost $100,000 to galvanize\neverybody into action and get the tail light. I see your\nargument in that case.\nThere's a difference, though, in this case\nbecause what they're saying in this case is they promised\nthat they would have a kind of administrative system in\nplace that would take account of all these various credit\ncharge card -- credit card charges and -- and would --\nwould ultimately result in -- in this -- this credit of up\nto $3,500 for our benefit. The various people who are\naggrieved by their failure to do it aren't all claiming\n$3,500. You know, they may be claiming everything from $5\nto $3,500. The only way to satisfy our -- our -- the\nclaims of all these people who are in the class is to put\nthe system in place.\nIf that's the essence of their claim, they're\nnot saying we want you to incur a lot of administrative\ncosts in order to get to a particular result, which is\njurisdictionally insufficient. They're saying, we want\nyou to put the system in the place -- in place that you\nagreed you would do. The system is not an administrative\ncost. It's what you promised in the first place. The\nsystem is the tail light.\nIs that a fair distinction, and does -- does\nthat count against you?\nMR. BERMAN: That's their argument, and I don't\nthink it counts against my position for two reasons. In\norder to make that argument, what they're really doing is\naggregating what it would cost to reinstitute the system\nas if they were going to pay all 6 million class --\nQUESTION: But the system is not an aggregated\nsystem. There's either a system or there isn't a system.\nIf there is a system, it produces different results\ndepending on the kind of business that individuals do.\nBut the system is not a separate system for all of the\nmembers of the class which is being aggregated. It's a\nsystem to fulfill one promise which was made in common\nform to the entire class. And isn't that a distinction\nwhich removes it from this notion simply of administrative\ncost?\nMR. BERMAN: No, because right now there are\njust six plaintiffs. This is not a class. And those six\nplaintiffs may have a total of $20,000 at stake. All Ford\nhas to do to satisfy their claim in this case is to give\nthose six people the rebates.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. BERMAN: And the only way to get around that\nis to aggregate this case, which they can't do. And so\nthe danger --\nQUESTION: There is -- there is no claim for\nspecific performance?\nMR. BERMAN: There is as to each plaintiff.\nQUESTION: But not as to a class.\nMR. BERMAN: That's right, because what we have\nhere and the --\nQUESTION: So they -- so they could multiply\n3,500 by 6 and that would be the end of the case.\nMR. BERMAN: That's right, because prior to this\nlitigation -- this gets to the common and undivided\ninterest. Prior to this litigation, these plaintiffs,\nthese 6 million people, were completely unrelated. They\nhad no common interest in this issue, and therefore, you\ncan't follow -- you can't aggregate. They have to be\ntreated --\nQUESTION: Let me ask you a philosophical\nquestion. Mr. Waxman got into epistemology a minute ago.\nLet me ask you a contrary-to-fact question.\nIf in fact the Federal action were a class\naction and it included everybody who had been included in\nthe State class actions and specific performance had been\nrequested in the form that I suggested, would that not\ntake it out of the aggregation problem and -- and --\nand -- and satisfy the jurisdictional amount, even on your\nown theory?\nMR. BERMAN: No, because under the analysis of\n-- of this Court and the Gilman court in the Second\nCircuit and the Ninth Circuit, again because each person\nhad a separate right, as they've admitted. They've\nadmitted that for damage purposes each person had a\nseparate and distinct claim.\nQUESTION: Yeah, but that's not the same as for\nspecific performance purposes.\nMR. BERMAN: It is. If -- if I -- if one of my\nplaintiffs decides he no longer wants to be in this\nlitigation, they have don't have to up the specific\nperformance to someone else. Each person only has the\nright to the rebates they were entitled to. So they're\nseparate and distinct no matter what the relief is.\nQUESTION: Were these class actions -- were\nthese actions certified as class actions in the State\ncourt before they were removed?\nMR. BERMAN: No. They -- they were removed\nbefore anything happened.\nQUESTION: So we have -- you need the\naggregation of the class action.\nMR. BERMAN: That's correct. You have an -- you\nhave an uncertified class here.\nThe other danger I'll touch on in my last minute\nof allowing the injunctive -- amount it would cost the\ndefendant, either by way of injunction or administrative\ncost, is that plaintiffs could use this new theory to\ninvoke Federal court jurisdiction. The amicus seem to\nsuggest that plaintiffs never want to be in Federal court.\nThat's not correct. If you adopt the petitioners' rule,\nanytime I have a case where I want to be in Federal court,\nwhere I normally could not be in Federal court -- and I\nhave many such cases right now -- I would just simply have\nto say in my prayer for relief that the -- the injunction\nwould cost the defendant more than $75,000. And bingo, I\nhave a whole new rule and there's a whole new group of\nFederal cases that suddenly would arise.\nSo in closing, unless there's any questions, the\nproblem with the defendants' -- the petitioners' position\nin this case is that it would open up the flood gates of\nlitigation to the Federal court system. We cited a RAND\nInstitute study that about 65 percent of the country's\nclass actions are in State courts, and to adopt their rule\nwould mean that many of those, probably thousands of\ncases, that are now residing in State courts would\nsuddenly find their way into Federal courts. That I think\nis not consistent with this Court's policy of strictly\nconstruing the diversity statute and giving deference to\nState courts and State governments with respect to laws\nthat they have the power to enact and to have those cases\nheard in State courts.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Berman.\nMr. Waxman, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Your Honor. I'll use 1\nminute on appellate jurisdiction and I hope 2 minutes on\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\nOn appellate jurisdiction, there is no doubt\nwhatsoever that what was intended here was a new complaint\nabout new things to proceed to judgment at trial. At page\n11 of the transcript of oral argument before the district\njudge on the class certification issue, the court says,\n\"if a nationwide class were to be certified\" -- he's\ntalking about the consolidated complaint -- \"would there\nbe any need for further MDL proceedings, or would the\nwhole litigation just be there in this one case for trial\nor other disposition?\n\"Mr. Berman: That is my understanding. There\nwould be no further -- everyone has consented. All the\nplaintiffs' counsel and defendants have consented to have\nthis case here.\"\nJustice Ginsburg, in response to your question\nabout cases in which a declaratory judgment action was\nfiled where it -- the case could have been litigated by a\nplaintiff class in a consumer case, that was the case in\nthe Greenwood Trust case filed by a bank in the First\nCircuit that ultimately produced this Court's decision in\nSmiley which was a consumer class action that came up out\nof California.\nNow, with respect to specific performance,\nspecific performance is the object of this complaint. It\nis what they want. It is the thing they need in order for\nany of them to be able to realize the benefits. And as\nthis Court said in Mississippi & Missouri River Bridge v.\nWard -- in that case, it involved removing a bridge\nobstruction -- the removal of the obstruction is the\nmatter of the controversy and the value of the object must\ngovern.\nThe complaint itself says they want specific\nperformance of the national rebate program, and if there\nwere any clarification needed, you look at page 45 of the\nred brief and they explain that that's just what they\nwant. If there were any --\nQUESTION: They don't -- they don't need that\nfor their relief. And wouldn't that be a frivolous\ncomplaint? Wouldn't that be conferring jurisdiction by --\nby making an assertion that goes way beyond what anybody\nwould consider reasonable?\nMR. WAXMAN: It's -- it would not if -- the\nCourt may or may not grant specific performance of the\nnational program in response to a particular plaintiff,\nbut it would certainly not be a frivolous claim. Cases\nlike that are brought all the time.\nQUESTION: Why -- Mr. -- Mr. Waxman, if you --\nif the test is one plaintiff -- if it's Judge Posner's\ntest, you assume there's one plaintiff, what will it cost\nthe defendant. Injunctive relief for one plaintiff would\nonly involve tracking that particular plaintiff's\npurchases, and that wouldn't add up to $75,000.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, first, the cost\nis -- the test is the cost of supplying the relief\nrequested in the complaint to any one plaintiff, and that\nis class-wide relief. It would also cost a sufficient\namount even if it were only one plaintiff.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Waxman.\nMR. WAXMAN: Thank you.\n"
