        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in Number 01-729, Delbert Smith and Bruce Botelho\nversus John Doe.\nMr. Roberts.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nAlaska's Megan's Law makes available to members\nof the public who seek it certain truthful information\nabout convicted sex offenders. The State makes this\ninformation available to help protect against the risk\nthat the convicted sex offender will offend again. It\nsays that in the law. Sex offenses are crimes of\nopportunity, and the purpose of making the information\navailable is to allow the members of the public to take\nsteps to reduce those opportunities.\nQUESTION: One -- one line that I -- I think\nthere is respondents seek to establish in this case is\nthat this information has to be generated by acts that\noccur after the conviction. You have to fill out the form\nsome -- four times a year, et cetera.\nI -- I've read in the brief -- I'm sure my\ncolleagues have too the -- the problem about going to the\npolice station. Just assume hypothetically that you had\nto go to the police station four times a year. Would that\nchange the case?\nMR. ROBERTS: No, it wouldn't, Your Honor.\nThat's the case in -- in about 14 States that -- that a\nquarterly verification has to be in person. It is not the\ncase in Alaska. And simply going to the police station\nfour times a year, which is reserved only for the most\nserious sex offenses, the aggravated offenses -- in all\nother cases it's just annually -- doesn't rise to the\nlevel of a burden that is at all tantamount to what we\nthink of as punishment under the Ex Post Facto Clause.\nQUESTION: I have forms I have to fill out four\ntimes a year for the Government.\ngoing to miss the deadline. If I had to present myself to\na -- a policeman, which is itself I think demeaning, I --\nI just don't know any analogue for -- is there any\nanalogue for that in -- in regulation of --\nMR. ROBERTS: In-person registration?\nQUESTION: -- the regulation of regulated\nindustries or things like that?\nMR. ROBERTS: I'm not sure of one where you\nactually have to show up in person, but the question is\nwhether that in-person requirement is rationally related\nto a legitimate regulatory purpose. That's the standard\nunder cases like Flemming.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Roberts, do they in Alaska\nhave to go personally or not?\nMR. ROBERTS: They do not. It clearly --\nQUESTION: Even for aggravated offenses?\nMR. ROBERTS: Even for aggravated offenses.\nQUESTION: And it can be filed by mail or how?\nMR. ROBERTS: Expressly can be filed by mail.\nThe instructions make that clear.\nQUESTION: Could -- could the administrative\nauthorities interpret the statute so that you would have\nto go to the station without amending the statute?\nMR. ROBERTS: I don't think so, because the\nstatute says the initial registration has to be in person.\nTypically it's in -- in prison. And then it says the\nlater verification has to be in writing. So I think it\nwould be an unreasonable reading of the statute to say\nthat the later verification had to be in writing.\nQUESTION: Do we have an issue here because this\nlaw was passed after a number of the people affected by it\nhad already been convicted, and so there are allegations\nof retroactivity concerns?\nMR. ROBERTS: The question is whether the\nburdens that the law imposes constitute punishment. If\nit's not punishment, then it's perfectly valid to apply it\nto people who were convicted prior to the effective date.\nAnd this is not --\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, the only challenge in\nthis case is to the retroactivity. Is that correct?\nMR. ROBERTS: Only the ex post facto challenge\nis before the Court in this case.\nQUESTION: And that's because these people were\ntried, convicted, served their time before the passage of\nthe act.\nMR. ROBERTS: That's correct, and --\nQUESTION: And their principal complaint, as I\nunderstand it, is that this is punishment because we can't\nget out. There's no escape from it. We can prove with\nexpert testimony that we are cured.\nout from under this demeaning regime, that much more than\nthe burden of going to a police station, that that's what\nit's about, that we're locked into this for life and it\nhas a devastating effect on our lives.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, for life, again only for\naggravated; for 15 years for other sex offenses. And yes,\nthat is one of their arguments, that they can't get out of\nit.\nBut this Court's cases haven't drawn that line.\nThe question is whether the burdens are pursuant to a\nlegitimate regulatory objective, or whether they're\npunitive. For example, in cases like Kansas against\nHendricks, couldn't get out of that, and yet that didn't\nmake it a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. Flemming\nagainst Nestor. You couldn't avoid the sanction there,\nand yet it did not rise to the level of punishment.\nQUESTION: But there was a -- there was a\ndetermination, at least in Hendricks, that you fit --\ncurrently fit into a certain category.\nMR. ROBERTS: A -- a particular subclass, yes.\nIt was an individualized determination required because\nthe depravation there, actual confinement, was far more\nsevere than the depravation at issue here. But neither an\nindividual determination, nor a chance to get out of it is\nrequired to avoid the categorization as punishment. Cases\nlike Hawker and De Veau make clear that a -- a reasonable\nlegislature can treat a category -- a category of sex\noffenders. They don't --\nQUESTION: But in Hawker, you didn't have to do\nanything. Here --\nMR. ROBERTS: Hawker was --\nQUESTION: -- I don't like to use the word\n\"affirmative action,\" because that has a connotation in\nsome other -- but you have to take an -- affirmative steps\nfor the rest of your life in -- in some cases. And\nthis -- and this seems to me very, very burdensome and to\ndifferentiate this class.\nMR. ROBERTS: Not true, of course, in Hendricks\nor Flemming or Salerno, no opportunity to avoid it there.\nYou didn't have to do anything to get the sanction applied\nto you. Now --\nQUESTION: No, no, no. I was -- I was saying\nbut the requirement of the statute is that for the rest of\nyour life you have to take affirmative steps to -- to\nre-register --\nMR. ROBERTS: You have to register.\nQUESTION: -- and to list all your automobiles\nand -- and to show that you've --\nMR. ROBERTS: You -- you have to fill out --\nQUESTION:\nMR. ROBERTS: -- one -- one side of one page.\nThat's the form that's involved here. That in itself\ncannot be punishment. We -- as Your Honor mentioned -- we\ndo that all the time in -- in today's society. So it must\nbe something else that makes this punishment.\nNow, what the Ninth Circuit's -- Ninth Circuit\nthought was that it was publishing it on the Internet,\nthat that made it punishment. But that's simply the\nmost -- most efficient and most economical way of making\ninformation available.\nIt also is passive. It's not displayed to\npeople who have no interest in the information, and in\nthat sense is far less invasive.\nThe publication on the Internet will -- yes, it\nmay cause adverse consequences when members of the\ncommunity learn this public fact about someone's past.\nBut the State is certainly free to weigh the convicted sex\noffender's interest in keeping that public fact from being\nwidely known against the interest of those in the position\nof, say, Megan Kanka's parents.\nQUESTION: Well, \"waive\" -- \"waive\" isn't quite\nthe word, Mr. Roberts. I mean, \"waive\" is something a\nperson does --\nMR. ROBERTS: \"Weigh.\" I'm sorry. \"Weigh.\"\nQUESTION:\nMR. ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Weigh the convicted\nsex offender's interest in keeping a public fact about his\npast secret against Megan Kanka's parents' interest in\nknowing that their new neighbor across the street had\ntwice been convicted of sexually abusing young girls.\nThat's a determination for the legislature to make.\nThere are costs --\nQUESTION: But you could get that from the\nrecord of conviction.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, and all the State is doing --\nQUESTION: But under the statute we have here,\nyou have affirmative steps that have to be taken for the\nrest of the person's life if he's a violent offender, to\nreport four times a year. I just don't know any analogue\nfor that.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, there are countless\nanalogues in the regulatory regime where people have to\nfile quarterly reports. If -- and -- and the question is\nwhether that requirement serves a valid regulatory\npurpose. It can't rise to the level of punishment just\nbecause the legislature has determined that the triggering\nevent --\nQUESTION: Well, but I suppose that's because\nyou choose to be in a regulated industry, or you choose to\nhave this withholding regime.\nimposed on a class of citizens by reason of their criminal\npast.\nMR. ROBERTS: There are -- there are many\ndisabilities that are imposed as a result of a prior\nconviction that the Court has found don't constitute\npunishment.\nQUESTION: None which require affirmative steps.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, the affirmative steps --\nit -- that has never been the test. The test has been\nwhether it rises to the level of punishment. Yes, the\naffirmative step of filling out one side of one page with\nthe sort of information that you'd -- would put on your\napplication to join the Price Club requires. There's\nnothing burdensome about that. It must be in their\nargument the use that that information is put to.\nQUESTION: What is our test for whether it rises\nto the level of punishment?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, when the --\nQUESTION: Didn't the Ninth Circuit found --\nfind there was no intent to make it punitive, but looked\nto the effects?\nMR. ROBERTS: That's right.\nQUESTION: Is it an effects test and how do we\napply it --\nMR. ROBERTS:\neffects test. You'd first see what the intent is, and\nthat is so critical, and nearly controlling because the\nsame sanction can be punitive or civil depending on the\npurpose. Even confinement can be civil if the purpose is\nprotective. So that's why purpose is so controlling.\nNow, once you determined that there's a\nregulatory purpose, as every court has -- not just every\nFederal court -- every court to look at these laws has\ndetermined they have a valid civil regulatory purpose --\nthen the one challenging that determination carries the\nheavy burden of establishing, by the clearest proof, with\nunmistakable evidence, that the effect is so punitive that\nthe purported purpose must, in fact, be a charade. And --\nQUESTION: But why isn't the evidence that this\nis -- is a face plastered on the Internet, that in modern\ntimes that is the equivalent of the town square where\nyou're shaming the bad actor? And here, you have a\nperson's face, and you have only the bad information. You\ndon't get the information that this person has\nsuccessfully completed a rehabilitation course. You don't\nget the information that this was on the scale of sexual\noffenses on the lighter side. The -- am I wrong about\nthat?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. That information is\navailable.\nperson is convicted, is available. So --\nQUESTION: Is it -- that's on the page -- the\npage with the photograph says what the crime was?\nMR. ROBERTS: That's my understanding, Your\nHonor, yes, that -- that -- I'm not sure what it is in\nevery State, but the -- the circumstances of conviction\nis -- it's one of the things that has to be registered,\nand is available to the public. So if it -- you can find\nout what the conviction was for.\nNow, I don't -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: In addition, on that page, what the\nviewer will see -- you don't see on the page with the face\nany disclaimer, any statement that the State is not\nbranding this person as dangerous. The State is simply\nmaking a statement that there was a conviction in the\npast.\nMR. ROBERTS: It conveys simply the truthful,\nobjective information that this individual was convicted\nof this crime, and the public is free to take appropriate\naction if they think that's -- that's appropriate under\nthe circumstances. It is different from the historic\nshaming penalties because of the purpose. And again,\npurpose is the nearly controlling factor. The purpose of\nthe shaming penalties was not to inform. Everybody in the\ncolonial village knew the circumstances of the offense.\nThe purpose was to shame. Here, the purpose is to inform.\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, on that point you said\nthis is truthful information, and it is. My question is,\nisn't -- it's not the whole truth because the successful\nrehabilitation in one case is not known. It's not known\nin the other case that a judge determined this -- this\nperson had been cured to the extent that he could have the\ncustody of a -- a minor child. That information is not\nknown. So the -- the public is getting only the bad, and\nnot the good. Its judgment is being skewed. And that's\nwhy it has a punitive flavor.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, it conveys the information\nthat the legislature thought was pertinent for people to\ntake action to protect themselves if they think it's\nwarranted. Nothing prevents them from finding out more if\nthey want to -- if they think that's pertinent --\nQUESTION: But nothing would prevent anybody\nfrom going to the court, or the police station and getting\na record of a particular person. It's made easy for them\nby the State -- access is made easy -- but only access to\nthe bad information.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, access to the information\nthat the legislature thought was pertinent and that people\nwanted to learn. There is no requirement --\nQUESTION:\na defendant to include additional information on the form,\nand if so, would it appear on the Internet?\nMR. ROBERTS: There's no provision for that\nunder Alaska's laws. I am aware of situations where --\nwhere they have a more active notification, where the\noffenders have taken steps to say, well, here's my side of\nthe story, but there's no provision for that on the\nInternet.\nQUESTION: Suppose they had the same statute,\nbut instead of it -- applying it to people who were\nconvicted, they applied it to people who had been\narrested, or alternatively, they applied it to people whom\na policeman said he had gotten suspicious information\nabout that he believed was accurate, no arrest -- now,\nsuppose it's exactly the same, but they just do -- they\napply it not in that way. What part of the Constitution,\nif any, would that violate?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, it might violate the Due\nProcess Clause if there's not a rational connection\nbetween --\nQUESTION: Well, it's rational in the sense that\na -- a reasonable person would think that these -- it's a\nway of stopping these, you know, criminals. They're\nsuspicious. They're -- they're -- suspicious people\nagainst whom there are suspicions are more likely to\ncommit crimes than people who are not suspected.\nMR. ROBERTS: The legislature would have to show\na rational basis for its categorization. That's the\nstandard --\nQUESTION: All right. Your answer is it\nviolates substantive due process or nothing.\nMR. ROBERTS: Or -- it may or may not, depending\non what it shows.\nQUESTION: All right. I've got that. I --\nMR. ROBERTS: Here the legislature had a solid\nbasis, a basis that this --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ROBERTS: -- Court has recognized, as\nrecently as last June in the McKune case, for the\nconclusion that those convicted have a high rate of\nrecidivism.\nQUESTION: Well, are you assuming from Justice\nBreyer's hypothesis, Mr. Roberts, that the policeman who\nhas spotted some suspicious -- that these people have\npreviously been convicted, or that this is just the -- the\nbeginning of the whole story is that a policeman spots\nsomeone?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, I understood the question to\nbe it's just the beginning of the whole story, and in that\ncase, I'd question whether --\nQUESTION: Well, there's certainly no ex post\nfacto problem there, is there?\nMR. ROBERTS: No, there wouldn't be --\nQUESTION: No, what I was driving at is suppose\nthat this statute too is -- I -- suppose I were to believe\nit was excessive in light of its purpose in respect to\nsome -- some people, but not to others. What part of the\nConstitution would it violate, if any?\nMR. ROBERTS: Certainly not the Ex Post Facto\nClause because in Seling against Young, the Court said you\nlook at the law on its face, not as applied. Halper had\nstarted looking at laws as applied to determine whether\nthey're punishment, and in Hudson and in Seling, the Court\nsaid we're not going to do that.\nI'd like to reserve the remainder of my time,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Roberts.\nGeneral Olson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nCongress and the legislatures of 50 States have\nagreed that citizens should have access to truthful\ninformation concerning the identity and location of\nconvicted sex offenders.\nQUESTION: Well, I suppose that the public in\ntheory has access to it anyway because convictions are a\nmatter of public record, and presumably any citizen who\nwanted to dig deep enough could find out who had been\nconvicted of what.\nWhat this scheme involves is getting a big\nmegaphone, in effect, making it more readily available.\nIs that what we're talking about here?\nMR. OLSON: I don't agree with the\ncharacterization of this as a megaphone. What I -- what I\nwould characterize it instead of saying it is the least\nintrusive, most passive way to provide information that is\nalready available to citizens, and can be obtained by\ncitizens, but to make it more accessible to them because\nthe people have decided that they want this information.\nQUESTION: But it isn't passive because you have\na lifetime obligation to update it.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, but it's --\nQUESTION: It is not passive.\nMR. OLSON: But it's -- but it's minimally\npassive and -- and minimally --\nQUESTION: Now we're up to minimally passive.\nMR. OLSON:\nregister to vote. We have to register to marry. We have\nto register to get a driver's license. We have to\ndisclose our homes when we buy a car, when we get a\ndivorce, when we fill out a census form.\nQUESTION: And most -- most of those do not\ninvolve -- involve shame or ridicule. This does.\nMR. OLSON: Well, the -- that is a separate\nquestion. I'm -- what I'm saying is that the burden of\nregistration or of keeping information current is a\nminimally intrusive burden.\nNow with respect to the question of shame, that\narises, to the extent that it exists at all, from the\nconviction of violating a sex offense. There is due\nprocess in connection with that -- that -- to the extent\nthat process is due -- and we'll get to that I know in the\nsubsequent case, but --\nQUESTION: Well, but precisely, but that -- that\nshows that there's an added burden here that was added by\nthe State after the conviction.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, but that -- that is true of\nmany regulatory measures. You can lose your right to\npractice in the securities field -- and that's been\nheld -- because of a conviction or to practice banking or\nthe right to vote. There are other consequences. This\nCourt has repeatedly said --\nQUESTION: If a banker or securities dealer were\nconvicted of -- of -- of a crime, could the Government\nafter the fact -- prospective -- pardon me --\nretroactively -- retroactively require that he or she file\ntheir -- their earnings statements for the rest of their\nlife with some regulatory agency?\nMR. OLSON: Well, I don't -- I -- I don't -- the\nCourt has never addressed that question, but the Court has\nheld that after the fact, it can -- the -- the legislature\ncan prevent those persons from practicing that profession,\nincluding the practice of medicine, being a fund raiser\nfor a union, losing the right to vote. The fact that\nthis -- what the -- this --\nQUESTION: But, General Olson, there's a -- a\ndifference in those -- those restrictions that affect one\npart of one's life. I can't practice a particular\nprofession, but I can go out and get a job. I -- I'm not\naffected in where I live. My neighbors know that I've\ncommitted a crime, but they don't -- the same reaction --\nthe notion that I am being labeled not a convicted\noffender -- which I am -- but a sex offender, a current\nstatus -- a current status with no opportunity to get out.\nMR. OLSON: Well, the -- well, the fact of\nregistration and disclosure relates to the conviction of a\nsex offense.\nand Congress have determined in response to the requests\nof the people -- as Mr. Roberts said, the test, according\nto this Court's jurisprudence, is the intent. The intent\nhere is not to punish. The intent is to respond to\ncitizens who have --\nQUESTION: Well, I think it's -- it's easy for a\nlegislature to say that, and in part, it's right. But in\npart, it seems to me that there are many indicia of\npunishment here as well. That's why you just don't rest\nwhen the legislature says it's regulatory. You must go\nbeyond that.\nMR. OLSON: Yes. This Court has said that\nonly -- you would go beyond that only if the evidence was\nthe clearest proof, unmistakable evidence that the intent\nor effect was punitive as opposed to regulatory. In this\ncase, there is no affirmative restraint on motion. There\nis no confinement. There is no restriction on travel or\nemployment or recreation, no obligation to submit to\nsearches, intrusive supervision or questioning.\nQUESTION: Well, there's no formal restriction\non employment, but it -- in many of these cases, these\npeople have terrible times renting a place to live,\ngetting a job.\nMR. OLSON: Well, the empirical evidence is not\ngreat that that is indeed a significant statistical\nproblem, but the problem, to the extent that it may exist,\nresults from the conviction of a -- of an -- of an\noffense --\nQUESTION: No. With -- with --\nMR. OLSON: -- about which an employer may want\nto know.\nQUESTION: With respect, Mr. Olson, I mean, I\nthink that's what's bothering us. The -- the offense has\nresulted in a conviction and a penalty. Each is a\none-time event, as it were, or a one-time status and each\nis over. What this is doing is, in effect, imposing a\nstatus of public shame for a period of 10 years, or\nwhatever it is, or a period of life in -- in the case of\ncertain offenses. And that is not merely the consequence\nof the conviction for the crime which was defined, is\nover, and done with. This is something new.\nMR. OLSON: Well, to apply the seven -- to the\nextent that the Court would apply the Kennedy Mendoza-\nMartinez factors, there is no affirmative disability or\nrestraint. Registration or publication has never been\nconsidered historically as punishment. The -- the --\nthere is a regulatory purpose. The -- even the Ninth\nCircuit --\nQUESTION: May I ask you a question about that?\nI -- I understand that the -- the percentage of sex\noffenses in Alaska with children is extremely high, and\nwhat is -- has been the effect of this scheme if it's been\nemployed? Has it had some effect there --\nMR. OLSON: I --\nQUESTION: -- in reducing the number of sex\noffenses?\nMR. OLSON: I do not know the answer to that,\nand perhaps Mr. Roberts does.\nBut what this is -- and I think this is a proper\nway to think of this statute -- in connection with a class\nof offenses, where the -- where the rate of recidivism is\nsignificantly higher -- as this Court has held very\nrecently -- than any other crime, people are asking their\ngovernment please allow us to know when we have someone in\nour neighborhood. When we -- when we're hiring a new --\nQUESTION: Could -- could the State require a\nspecial mark on your license plate?\nMR. OLSON: No, I -- well, I don't know, Justice\nKennedy, but I would say that would be considerably\ndifferent than what's here because that would --\nQUESTION: I don't think it's very different.\nMR. OLSON: Pardon me?\nQUESTION: I don't think it's very different.\nMR. OLSON: I -- I respectfully submit that it's\na great deal different.\nor mark on your forehead would go wherever you would go.\nIt would require you to carry the government's message\nrather than the government supplying the message.\nQUESTION: Well, this statute requires you to\nmake the government's message four times a year.\nMR. OLSON: It only -- it doesn't require you to\nmake the government's message four times a year. The\ngovernment's message, I respectfully submit, is made when\na citizen submits an inquiry to the State through the\nInternet listing. All -- it is required four times a year\nis to advise the government of a current location or\ncurrent information so that the information on the\nregistry is accurate and -- and up-to-date.\nThis is information that citizens have requested\nfrom their government. Their government has the\ninformation of people who have committed certain types of\ncrimes, who society has perceived as particularly\ndangerous. It's a self-protective mechanism. The -- not\nonly the --\nQUESTION: But they -- the Megan's Laws are not\nall one size and shape. I mean, some of them have the\ndisclaimer right on the page saying we're not labeling\nthis person dangerous and -- and have a chance for a\nperson to get off it. Here, because there's no give, it\ndoes have a punitive feel.\nI mean, as far as the Federal legislation is\nconcerned, a State that tells the whole truth -- is\nthat -- that kind of law is totally acceptable within the\nFederal requirement, isn't it?\nMR. OLSON: It -- it would seem to -- well, I\nthink the answer is that yes, it would because the Federal\nstatute simply prescribes a floor.\nIt's going to be virtually impossible and quite\nburdensome for the State to supply what you suggest would\nbe complete information about any individual. What the\nparents and the --\nQUESTION: It doesn't -- at least to say what --\nwhether the crime was a misdemeanor or a felony, the\ndisclaimer certainly to -- to say, now we are not labeling\nthis person a forever sex offender. We are labeling this\nperson a convicted --\nMR. OLSON: Well, and that is all that the\nregistry does, and I submit that to the extent that your\nquestion goes to any of the seven Kennedy Mendoza-Martinez\nfactors, it's excessiveness is -- on -- on the scale.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: And I would submit that this\nregistry and this information, providing truthful, public\nrecord, readily accessible information is -- is minimal.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Olson.\nMr. Thompson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DARRYL L. THOMPSON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. THOMPSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWe believe that the Alaska Sex Offender\nRegistration Act imposes punishment because it possesses\nthree features which are classically considered to be\npunishment, and not like any other civil or regulatory\nmeasure this Court has seen before.\nFirst of all, the sanction attaches\nautomatically and inescapably solely on a basis of a prior\nconviction, without any determination of present\ndangerousness at all.\nSecondly, the sanction is a pervasive regulation\nof the person themselves. There is no attempt to try to\nregulate an activity or a profession here. It's a\nregulation of the person himself.\nQUESTION: Well, to what extent do you -- do you\nmean, Mr. Thompson? You said to regulate the person\nhimself. I mean, he is not circumscribed in his\nactivities, is he?\nMR. THOMPSON: He has to report four times a\nyear.\nQUESTION: But not in Alaska --\nMR. THOMPSON: Just like they do on probation.\nQUESTION: In Alaska, not in person, I take it.\nMR. THOMPSON: Well, we respectfully disagree\nwith Mr. Roberts' characterization of the statute. The\nstatute gives unfettered discretion to the Department of\nPublic Safety -- the police -- to administer it in a way\nthat it deems appropriate.\nQUESTION: How -- how has it been administered?\nMR. THOMPSON: Regulatorily they have done it by\nmail. But I can cite you instances, with affidavits in a\nparallel case, of people that were mandated to report to\nthe police. They can do it and --\nQUESTION: Well, but that's not part of -\nMR. THOMPSON: -- have the discretion to do it.\nQUESTION: That's not -- that's not part of the\nrecord here, is it?\nMR. THOMPSON: That is not part of the record\nhere. But they have --\nQUESTION: At least -- at least --\nMR. THOMPSON: -- the unfettered discretion by\nthe pure statutory language.\nQUESTION: When the -- they have to replace the\nphotographs periodically.\nMR. THOMPSON: They do, and -- and they're\nrequired to -- on their quarterly report to report any\nchanges in their physical characteristics, they gain\nweight, they grow gray hair, they get lasik surgery, don't\nhave glasses, grow a beard, get fat. Whatever it is,\nthey've got to report that information. And you know\nthat's going to be a triggering event. I mean, if they\nlook different, the police are going to have them come\nback in and get a new photograph --\nQUESTION: Well, but I mean, how is that\ndifferent? Everybody -- you're sort of turning this on\nwhether you have to walk to the police station or not.\nI mean, a lot of people have to go in and report different\nthings, send in forms, give their pictures, even give\ntheir fingerprints.\nI would think that the problem is what happens\nto that information later, that everybody in the\nneighborhood knows it, that they're likely to shun the\npeople, that -- that it may be too broad. I mean, is\nthat -- is it really the police -- having to walk\nsomewhere and write something as opposed to sending in a\nreport that makes all the difference?\nMR. THOMPSON: No. I mean, what I -- what I --\nthe third characteristic is -- is the stigmatizing\ncharacteristic, which I want to -- want to talk about\nhere. But it's not just --\nQUESTION:\na dangerous sex offender, who poses a real risk to\nchildren in that area? Now, what about that? Are -- is\nthis a -- a scheme that is applied to such a person that\nposes constitutional problems, do you think, or does\npublic safety rise to the level where it can be responded\nto in this fashion?\nMR. THOMPSON: Well, unlike the -- the Kansas\nsituation, Kansas v. Hendricks, there's no effort to weed\nout those who are dangerous from those who are not.\nQUESTION: Yes. That's not the question I asked\nyou.\nMR. THOMPSON: I apologize.\nQUESTION: I asked you whether, as applied to\nsomeone who is exceedingly dangerous, in your view does\nthe scheme survive?\nMR. THOMPSON: Well, no. It's still an evasive\nregulation of the individual just like probation and it's\nstill a stigmatizing system that labels them as dangerous.\nQUESTION: Maybe he deserves stigmatization\nif -- with the high recidivist rate under the facts that\nJustice O'Connor gave you. The person is still dangerous.\nMR. THOMPSON: But not all of them are. And\nthat's the problem with this statute. It applies to those\npeople that are demonstrably not dangerous.\nQUESTION:\nQUESTION: But your --\nQUESTION: -- how -- how -- this is -- what is\nyour response to Justice -- to the argument that was made\non the other side? It said simply this, that you're --\nyou're raising an ex post facto claim. Now, we don't want\nto be nitpicking about this, but an ex post facto claim is\na question of whether this is punishment, and they're\nsaying it's not seen as punishment. It wasn't their\nintent to punish. It was their intent to inform so that\nthe thing won't happen again. That's not a punitive\nintent.\nAnd therefore, your claims about how bad this is\nmay be right. And suppose I accept them. Suppose I think\nthey're right. Should I not, nonetheless, wait until\nsomebody raises a substantive due process claim? That way\nyou can decide if the problem with the statute is overly\nbroad, if the problem is that some people should have it\napplied to them and others shouldn't. All the things that\nyou mentioned would come into play. But as far as\npunitive intent is concerned, that's not the\nlegislature's --\nMR. THOMPSON: Well, we -- I'm sorry. We\ndisagree --\nQUESTION: I mean, that's the argument.\nMR. THOMPSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: And I'd like to -- but tell me what\nabout the relation of the substantive Due Process\nClause -- about why isn't that the better vehicle to make\nyour argument? Now, that's what I'd just like to hear you\ndiscuss.\nMR. THOMPSON: I mean, it certainly is a\nvehicle, you know, to talk about whether or not it's\nnarrowly tailored to -- to a specific regulatory goal.\nI think that is a proper challenge, and it was challenged\nat the lower court level.\nBut we're here today on an ex post facto\nquestion before the Court, and the question is, is it\npunishment, or is it not? And we -- we respectfully\ndisagree that this is intended to be purely a regulatory\nmeasure. And we disagree because the State's sole\nreliance is on the language found in the preamble of the\nstatute, that it's designed to protect the public. That's\none of the penal goals under the constitution in the State\nof Alaska for criminal justice system.\nQUESTION: Of course, that's true, but in my\nmind rings a case, in which I was in dissent, but the\nmajority has the law, and that's Hendricks. If, after\nall, it's not punishment to put a person in a cell -- and\nI thought it was, but the majority thought it wasn't --\nwhy is it punishment, following the law, to simply require\nthe person to make reports four times a year?\nMR. THOMPSON: Well, it is -- it is -- probation\nrequires the exact same thing, and that's our point.\nQUESTION: And it -- it required less than\nputting the person in what was, in effect, a jail cell.\nI'm -- I'm looking at the precedent on ex post facto.\nMR. THOMPSON: Certainly. And -- and -- and you\nknow, Hendricks and Salerno present the types of cases\nthat are steeped in the pedigree of this Court looking to\nthe need to protect the public from those people that are\nactively dangerous now, and that's why it was important in\nHendricks that there was, in fact, those protections\nafforded to the individual. I mean, it doesn't happen\nautomatically that Hendricks was going to be put in jail.\nThere had to have been a jury trial, or trial by a judge\nwith a preponderance beyond a reasonable doubt, and he's\nallowed an annual review. He can petition at any time.\nThe secretary, at his own discretion, can remove that\nrestriction. So the duration of that is solely limited\nand -- and looks to the purpose to protect the people from\nthose -- the public from those people that are dangerous.\nNone of those protections are here. In fact,\nthis is a wide-sweeping statute that takes everybody in.\nAnd -- and we have to look --\nQUESTION:\nI have with -- with your side of the case is that this is\npublic information insofar as a conviction is concerned.\nInsofar as addresses, credit card companies, and driver's\nlicense bureaus have this stuff all the time. It would\nseem to me that if the Court were to strike down these\nlaws, some private business could have a web -- a web\npage, just like credit card companies do. There may be\nsome Privacy Act concerns, but still, this is truthful\ninformation.\nMR. THOMPSON: It's not truthful information,\nand respectfully, I -- I agree with what Justice Ginsburg\nwas saying earlier. I mean, it's -- it's false --\nQUESTION: It's -- it's truth as far as it goes.\nThere's nothing false in the information reported.\nI questioned whether it was the whole truth because it has\nthe bad side, but none of the good.\nMR. THOMPSON: It's sort of the sin of omission,\nparticularly when we look -- we look to --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I suppose a lot of\ncredit --\nMR. THOMPSON: Well, and -- and it goes further\nthan that.\nQUESTION: -- the credit reports are misleading\ntoo. Maybe the person is now very successful, and is\npaying all their bills. You don't know.\nMR. THOMPSON: But the legislatures made it\nclear that they are telling the public that these people\nweren't just someone who once had a conviction. They're\ntelling the public that these people are actively\ndangerous now, presently dangerous to be actively avoided.\nAnd how do they do that? If you know someone is\non the registry -- and the idea being make my own informed\nchoice. Now that I know this information, get some more\ninformation. And if you know they're on the registry and\nyou get the rest of that information, you know they're\ncured, you know they've been great --\nQUESTION: Well, does -- does any entity in a\nsociety, a -- a nursery school have an interest in -- in\nknowing the background of their employees?\nMR. THOMPSON: Readily available, and it has\nalways been available and it was available before the\nstatute.\nQUESTION: Well, they have an -- they have an\ninterest in knowing that. That isn't -- that isn't\nsomehow punitive or -- or half the truth. They make\nthe -- they make the inference that there's -- that\nthere's a hazard here, a risk they don't want to take.\nMR. THOMPSON: What I was getting at earlier\nwas -- is that the State of Alaska makes it a crime,\nfelony child endangerment, if you leave your kid alone\nwith someone who's on the registry. And it doesn't matter\nthat that person is safe. It doesn't matter that that\nperson is not dangerous. So the State is telling you that\nthey are to be avoided.\nQUESTION: Well, but that -- that issue is\nnot -- not before the Court, and if that's so, this --\nthis just shows that it's a regulatory scheme which has\nanother valid purpose.\nMR. THOMPSON: We disagree. What we think that\ndemonstrates is that it's a clear proclamation because it\ncame at the same time as the amendments in '97, a clear\nproclamation of a legislative intent to tell the public\nthat everyone on that registry is currently, presently\ndangerous.\nQUESTION: Well, you disagree with -- you\ndisagree with the court of appeals then when they said it\nwas not a punitive intent on the part of --\nMR. THOMPSON: Yes, we do disagree with that and\nwe -- we briefed that in our brief.\nQUESTION: Well, you would -- you would concede\nthat it is least ambiguous because the legislature said\nour purpose is regulatory. So you're not going to say\nthat's -- that's incredible.\nMR. THOMPSON: Well, the legislature never said\nit was a civil regulatory measure.\nsaid and what their sole reliance on intent is, is in the\npreamble where it says it serves to protect the public.\nAnd -- and it's clear that protection of the public in --\nin Salerno was -- was viewed as a proper regulatory goal,\nbut in -- in Brown it's also viewed as a proper criminal\ngoal. And in Alaska, it's the goal -- one of the stated\ngoals under article I, section 12 of the penal\nadministration -- it is a criminal goal to protect the\npublic. So I don't think that -- that's -- that's --\nQUESTION: But it's a civil goal too, I --\nMR. THOMPSON: It is a civil goal too.\nQUESTION: You rely to some extent on the\nplacement in the criminal code both that the information\nabout this registry system has to be part of every\ncriminal judgment and part of every rule 11 colloquy.\nMR. THOMPSON: That's -- that's true. The\nlegislature, you know, in our view considered it such an\nimportant component and consequence of any criminal\nconviction, that in fact, that's the only information that\na judge has to give to someone convicted of a sex offense\nin writing.\nQUESTION: So I thought it might be fair for you\nto say, well, it's -- it's mixed. It's ambiguous. In\nsome respects, it's -- looks regulatory. In other\nrespects it looks punitive.\nyou say instead of -- so we have to look further. But are\nyou saying right from the very reading of this law, it is\nnecessarily punitive?\nMR. THOMPSON: We do believe that. I mean, it\nwas intended, again, to protect the public, but when you\nlook to a law that's -- that's geared directly at\nindividuals or groups of individuals and not set out to\nregulate any kind of activities, you know, that is an\nintent in our view to -- to punish --\nQUESTION: Would it affect --\nMR. THOMPSON: -- solely based upon a prior\nconviction.\nQUESTION: Your claim is an ex post facto claim,\na retroactivity claim. Suppose this scheme, the Alaska\nscheme, did allow people -- like the parties here -- to\nsay, I'm no longer dangerous. Here's the documentation of\nthat. Take me off the list. Would you say, nonetheless,\nit's still punitive? Are you saying that even if someone\nmade no showing at all of lack of dangerousness,\nthis is -- it would be ex post facto and therefore must\nfall?\nMR. THOMPSON: If I -- Justice Ginsburg --\nQUESTION: You -- you are asserting that Doe I\nand II are people who are no longer dangerous.\nMR. THOMPSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: But I'm asking you about the people\nin this large category who are still dangerous, or at\nleast have made no showing that they're not dangerous.\nYou would have the same ex post facto argument with\nrespect to those people? Or does it depend, to some\nextent, on the ability to show that you're not dangerous?\nMR. THOMPSON: First of all, I think we would --\nwe would take the position that in the absence of any\ncriteria of actual present dangerousness demonstrates\nthat -- that the legislature is aimed at the prior\nconviction and tacking on certain responsibilities to the\nprior conviction as opposed to really trying to fit the\ngoal here of protecting the public from dangerous people.\nQUESTION: But if the legislature says we don't\nwant this to be punitive, therefore we will give everyone\nwho was a convicted sex offender an opportunity to show\nthat they're no longer dangerous, and then there will be a\ndetermination made, yes, you are, no, you're not, would\nyou still be making the ex post facto argument for the\npeople who have not shown they're no longer dangerous?\nMR. THOMPSON: I think it would certainly be a\ncloser call, and --\nQUESTION: Why would it be a --\nMR. THOMPSON: -- and my clients would certainly\ninvite that hearing.\nQUESTION: Why would it be a closer call? Why\nwould it be a closer call? Is everything that is bad\nregulation punishment? I mean, all that would show -- all\nyou're claiming is that some people who are not dangerous\nare -- are wrongly covered by this regulatory measure.\nThat still doesn't prove that the regulatory measure is\npunitive. It just shows that it's stupid.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: That doesn't make it violate the Ex\nPost Facto Clause. Every regulatory measure that goes too\nfar is -- is not criminal punishment.\nMR. THOMPSON: It is if it looks just like\nprobation and has the same consequences as probation\nbecause probation is historically --\nQUESTION: That's -- that's -- the question\nJustice Ginsburg started with is every time -- you just\nreplied to Justice Scalia -- and what I hear are words\nthat seem to apply with equal force to a perfectly-\ntailored statute that would catch only the most dangerous\nsex offenders who everyone agrees are virtually\nuncontrollable and might repeat their offense many, many\ntimes.\nSee, if it applies -- if the argument -- the\nquestion people are asking you -- I'm simply repeating\nit -- is, on your argument why isn't that just as much an\nex post facto law? What has it got to do with the matter\nthat it's overly broad, et cetera, which sounds to me like\na substantive due process argument, not an ex post facto\nargument? That's the same question. But I would like you\nto focus right on it.\nMR. THOMPSON: Well, I apparently have not been\ndoing a very good job of it, but I'll try.\nWhen we look to whether or not the statute\nimposes a punishment, I think it's important that we look\nto whether or not it -- it's -- fits with the umbrella of\nthings which have historically considered to be\npunishment. And that's one of our starting points, and\nthat's why I keep going back to the concept of probation\nand parole because historically there's no dispute that\nprobation is a depravation of liberty. Not -- it's not\nlike going to jail, but it's a depravation of liberty.\nAnd -- and it's been considered as punishment, and that's\nwhat this thing does to people.\nNow, if it was a perfectly-tailored -- such that\nit could weed out the dangerous from the non-dangerous --\nwell, we would invite that because my clients wouldn't be\nhere today. My client has been determined, you know, to\nbe not dangerous by a superior court family judge.\nBut would it still be punishment? I think we'd\nhave to look at the -- a little bit closer at it. But,\nyou know, if there's a closer nexus between the public\npurpose and there -- there is a weeding out, maybe it\nwouldn't be punishment because maybe it's -- it's\nescapable, it -- it's --\nQUESTION: But then -- then you might --\nMR. THOMPSON: -- at that point, it's not\nregulating him for life.\nQUESTION: Well, at that point at least there\nwould be -- I -- I assume your -- your point would be that\nthere -- there is at least a -- a credible basis to say\nthat if it covers only those who are affirmatively shown\nto be dangerous, the object is simply to apprise the\npublic to who is dangerous, and that doesn't sound very\npunitive. But if there is no attempt to weed out the\ndangerous from the non-dangerous, then the claim that the\nobject is simply to apprise the public of who is dangerous\nis not so credible. I mean, isn't -- isn't --\nMR. THOMPSON: That is my point.\nQUESTION: -- that one of your points?\nQUESTION: If that's your point, then how do you\nrespond to their argument which is that that's just too\ntough to do? We don't know enough about it. It -- it\nwould invite endless hearings. It would be impossible to\nadminister this statute. I'm not making the argument.\nI'm repeating it --\nMR. THOMPSON: Right.\nQUESTION: -- for you to respond to.\nMR. THOMPSON: I guess that would make the --\nthe due process hearing or the -- the hearing that is\nestablished in -- in Hendricks, and the hearing that's\nestablished in Salerno futile as well. I mean, judges are\ncalled upon every day to make determinations as to whether\nor not people are presently dangerous. They do it every\nday in the context of evaluating the sentencing criteria\nin the State of Alaska. It's called the Chaney Criteria.\nThey have to look to whether or not someone poses a risk\nto the community. That's what they have to do in --\nQUESTION: How many Megan's Laws have that\nregime? I -- I understand that some of them do. Some of\nthem are like Alaska. They say this is based solely on\nyour past conviction. Others say you have an opportunity\nto show that you're no longer dangerous. What -- in -- in\nthe range of Megan's Laws that all the States have, how\nmany treat this as something you can get out of by showing\nyou're not dangerous?\nMR. THOMPSON: You know, I don't have a -- a\nnumber for you. I can't tell you if it's 23 States or\nnot. I don't -- I'm sorry. I don't --\nQUESTION: What's wrong about --\nMR. THOMPSON: I don't know that.\nQUESTION: What's wrong about warning the public\nabout who may be dangerous? You -- you seem to say that\nit's only -- it's only okay if the State warns the public\nabout who is dangerous. What's wrong about warning the\npublic about who may be dangerous? Let the public make --\nyou know, the later -- later determination.\nMR. THOMPSON: I guess we get down to this who\ndetermines who they're -- who may be dangerous or not.\nI mean, what -- what's the criteria for that?\nQUESTION: What is irrational or\nunconstitutional about warning the public about a category\nof people who may be dangerous as to whom -- as the entire\ncategory of whom, there's more likely to be danger than --\nthan with respect to other people? Where is it written\nthat you can only warn the public about those whom you\nhave -- are sure are dangerous?\nMR. THOMPSON: Part of the problem with the\nstatute, it's not just a warning of the public. I mean,\nit -- it's -- there are really various components. It's\nnot just a notification statute. I mean, you know, the\npublic right now has access to -- through another statute\nthat we have -- to offender information. All they've got\nto do is request. And this is an unnecessary statute\nin -- in one sense. Does it broadcast it on the Internet?\nNo.\ninformation that's available not just going to a\ncourthouse, but you can actually request the State for\nthat information. And -- and for some people, the\ninformation may be limited. There are some restrictions.\nQUESTION: I'm -- I'm not sure if it helps you\nor hurts you. It -- it indicates that -- that the most\ndistressing and damaging fact that you have -- that you\nhave the conviction is available to the public anyway.\nAnd this is just a regulatory scheme to -- to make that\ninformation more clear as to how many people are in the\ncommunity have suffered that conviction.\nMR. THOMPSON: What I was going to say is that\nthe information as to serious offenses that are beyond\n10 years is limited. There's some sense of limitation,\nsome sense of it's been a long time. So that information\nis limited to those people that have a need to know, like\nfor example, the day care providers and the teachers\nand -- and schools who want to know --\nQUESTION: Well, but I take it under the\nregistration form we're talking about, that the date of\nthe conviction is there, and the -- the citizen can make\nup his or her own mind as to whether the conviction was so\nlong ago that they're no longer worried about it.\nMR. THOMPSON: They really don't have the right\nkind of information to make that decision.\nthey have is only the conviction --\nQUESTION: You want -- you want more information\non this form?\nMR. THOMPSON: Absolutely not.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. THOMPSON: The -- you know, I don't. I\ndon't want more information.\nAnd the -- the tribunal that should be making\nthe determination of dangerousness really ought to be in a\nthoughtful, rational process in front of a -- of a judge.\nQUESTION: What -- what if the State simply\ndecided we're going to put on the Internet, the same way\nthat Alaska does here, the names of all the people who had\ncriminal convictions of any sort without any more\ninformation in -- in the last 5 years? Now, if they\napplied that to people who were convicted after they\npassed it, would that be ex post facto?\nMR. THOMPSON: I don't know that it would. It\nwould probably have the same stigmatizing effect. I mean,\nI just -- I want to share with you the State has already\ndone that in the State of Alaska. You can get information\nas to anyone in the State of Alaska by a click of a mouse\nby going on the Internet, if their convictions were in the\nState of Alaska. That information is already available.\nQUESTION:\neffect, why would your answer be different? Why -- why\nwould it not be ex post facto in that case, whereas it is\nin this? I'm not sure what line you're drawing.\nMR. THOMPSON: Well, the stigmatizing effect\nhere is that these people are being currently labeled\nas -- as sex offenders.\nQUESTION: No. I -- I realize that, but you\nsaid in answer to the Chief Justice's question that there\nwould be the same -- in your judgment, there would be the\nsame stigmatizing effect if they put every criminal\nconviction on -- on the Internet. And if -- if the\nstigmatizing effect would be the same and the information\nwould be just as readily available, why would your answer\nbe different, that that would not be ex post facto whereas\nthis is? That would not be punitive. This is punitive.\nMR. THOMPSON: Well, perhaps it would, but you\nknow, our analysis of this ex post facto argument is\nreally a composite of a variety of components of the\nstatute and not simply the public notification provision.\nQUESTION: Well, what --\nMR. THOMPSON: It's certainly an important part.\nQUESTION: You're tapping everything, the\nregister and --\nMR. THOMPSON: Yes.\nQUESTION:\nrequirement that they register, even if it's just\ncirculated to law enforcement people, that's impermissibly\nretroactive as well.\nSo there can be -- is there any scheme for\nkeeping track of ex-offenders that would pass the ex post\nfacto test in your judgment, or is it just they've served\ntheir time, they've done whatever, parole is given to\nthem, and that's it?\nMR. THOMPSON: You know, if -- if the\nrequirements of the individual subject to the registration\nrequirements alone were not as onerous as here where they\nhave to report on every 90 days all kinds of personal\ninformation, and if they don't, then they're going to\nbe -- go -- go to jail, it may be a closer call. I mean,\nthere was the -- the history of the felony registrations,\nbut they've never really been approved by this Court as\nsomehow being a proper regulatory measure.\nQUESTION: On the other hand, I don't know of\nany precedent -- perhaps you can tell us if there is --\nfrom this Court saying that a measure with a declared\nregulatory purpose is, nonetheless, impermissibly\nretroactive. I don't know of any case that so holds.\nMR. THOMPSON: Nothing is jumping out at me\neither.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Let me ask you to comment on -- on\none thing --\nMR. THOMPSON: But these are unique statutes.\nQUESTION: I'm sorry. One -- one thing that\nmakes it more difficult perhaps than it might be to see\nyour side of the argument -- go back to the Chief\nJustice's question. What if they put every criminal\nconviction on the Internet?\nWell, there's one difference between the\nsituation that would obtain then and the situation that --\nthat you're objecting to here. That is, that there is not\nthe same high recidivism rate for crimes generally that\nthere is, apparently undisputedly, for sex crimes in the\nState of Alaska. And therefore, when you earlier made the\nargument that there is something very -- something less\nthan credible in the State's claim that it's merely trying\nto inform the public when, in fact, it makes no\ndifferentiation between current dangerousness and un\ncurrent dangerousness, the answer is there is -- or an\nanswer is -- there is a very high recidivism rate, and\nthat high recidivism rate does support the claim that\nthere is something that -- that it is credible to say that\nby publishing this information, we are simply trying to\ninform people of a probability of dangerousness, leaving\nthem to do what they want.\nWhat is -- is there any -- do you have any\nresponse to this claim that the high recidivism rate\nitself supports the argument that, in fact, this is\nnothing but a safety information kind of measure, whereas\nbroadcasting all criminal convictions would not be\njustified as having a good fit between the object and what\nthe State was doing? Do you have any response to that?\nMR. THOMPSON: I certainly don't profess to be\nan expert on the statistical recidivist rates. I think\nthat is --\nQUESTION: You don't dispute the State's\nrecidivism figure, do you?\nMR. THOMPSON: Well, actually vis-a-vis the\nbrief that was submitted by Massachusetts as an amici in\nthis, sets forth a very different pattern of recidivist\nrates. I mean, when we say recidivist rates, are we\ntalking about repeat sex offenses? Are we talking about\nrepeated crimes? I mean, there are all different ways in\nwhich --\nQUESTION: They're making specific -- they're\nmaking specific claims. They -- they set out specific\npercentages with respect to Alaska. Are you disputing\nthose figures or not?\nMR. THOMPSON: We do.\nQUESTION: You do. All right.\nMR. THOMPSON: We do, but I don't think we did\nit directly in our brief, but I think other -- other\nbriefs --\nQUESTION: That's -- that's the trouble. Yes.\nMR. THOMPSON: -- do.\nYou know, even if we accept --\nQUESTION: Do you take into account that the\ndegree of harm, if you make a mistake? That is, suppose\nsomebody is a pickpocket and you have a list and say,\npickpockets have to register, the same thing as here. So\nif you make a mistake about a pickpocket, somebody is out\nof some change. If you make a mistake here about a\nperson's dangerousness, the consequences could be very\ngrave.\nMR. THOMPSON: And there's a solution to that,\nand the solution is have -- is to look to the\nindividualized determination of the person's present\ndangerousness. And, you know, in the McKune case, the --\nQUESTION: Would it be all right to have the\nperson report every 90 days to have a determination of\npresent dangerousness?\nMR. THOMPSON: It certainly wouldn't be\nnecessary for John Doe I. He's already had a\ndetermination that he's not dangerous by a court. I don't\nknow why you'd have to continue to redo that. I mean, the\nidea is you get progressively --\nQUESTION: I'm interested in the Chief Justice's\nhypothetical.\nMR. THOMPSON: No, it wouldn't be all right.\nQUESTION: It wouldn't be all right?\nMR. THOMPSON: No, not every 90 days. That's --\nthat's awfully burdensome to require someone not just to\ncome into the police station or fill out a written form,\nbut to require someone -- as a direct consequence of a\nprior conviction, to require someone to come and -- and be\nsubject every 90 days to a judicial scrutiny as to whether\nor not you're still dangerous, that seems to be a pretty\nbig disability.\nQUESTION: It is a way out.\nMR. THOMPSON: It is a way out.\nQUESTION: And one of your complaints is this\nsystem provides no way out.\nMR. THOMPSON: That's absolutely correct. It is\na way out.\nThe Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act really\nis nothing other than tacking on -- for my clients -- a\nlifetime of probation, a lifetime of community\nsupervision, having to report to the police -- my time is\nup.\nQUESTION:\nMr. Roberts, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI think it is very important to place the\nvarious points that have been touched on this morning in\nthe proper legal framework.\nThe question, Justice Kennedy, is not whether\nit's burdensome to require someone to fill out a form and\nverify it. The question is, is that so punitive that you\ndon't believe the legislature when it says that we're\ndoing this to prevent future harm?\nThe question, Justice Ginsburg, is not whether\nit might be a better system if it included other\ninformation, or whether that would be too burdensome for\nthe State. The question is, does the failure to put on\nameliorative information convince you that the legislature\nwas simply not telling the truth when it said we're doing\nthis to prevent future harm?\nAnd the question is not whether you should have\nan individualized determination or a group determination.\nIt is, is the group determination so irrational that you\nthink the legislature was not really interested in\npreventing future harm, it was just doing this to punish?\nIn fact, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, this Court has\nnever found a law with a civil regulatory purpose to\nviolate the Ex Post Facto Clause.\nQUESTION: Is the effects test used to impeach\nthe finding that the legislature had a regulatory intent?\nMR. ROBERTS: I think that is --\nQUESTION: I -- I thought that it was an\nadditional step that you had to take if you -- even if you\nfind the legislature had the -- the permitted intent.\nMR. ROBERTS: I think it only makes sense if you\nview it as impeaching the intent because, as Chief Justice\nWarren pointed out in Trop v. Dulles, the evident purpose\nis controlling because the same sanction can be civil or\ncriminal. $10,000 civil penalty is not criminal.\nA $10,000 fine is. You don't look at the perspective of\nthe individual because --\nQUESTION: So long as the legislature has a pure\nintent, it can have as burdensome a regulation as it wants\nbased on previous criminal convictions?\nMR. ROBERTS: I think if the regulation is so\nburdensome that it causes you to doubt the intent, then\nyou do have a problem, but that is the purpose.\nQUESTION: You're not saying -- you're saying if\nit's -- it wouldn't violate the Ex Post Facto Clause in\nyour view. It might violate some other clause like the\nsubstantive due process.\nMR. ROBERTS: But again, with respect to both\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause and the Due Process Clause, the\nquestion is whether there's a rational connection between\nthe sanction and the legislative purpose.\nNow, if it is too extreme, it may cause you to\ndoubt that connection. For example, it may be -- the\nlegislature may say we think safe crackers present a risk\nof recidivism, so we're going to cut off their hands.\nThere may be a rational connection there, but it's too\nexcessive given the purpose.\nThere's no way in which this law can be regarded\nas too excessive. It simply makes available information\nthat is already a matter of public record, and publicly\navailable because criminal trials under our system have to\nbe public.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,\nMr. Roberts.\n"
