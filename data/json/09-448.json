        "content": "(11:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear\nargument next in Case 09-448, Hardt v. Reliance Standard\nLife Insurance Company.\nMr. Ates.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. ATES\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ATES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Fourth Circuit vacated an award of\nattorney's fees to Petitioner Hardt even though the\ndistrict court found Respondent violated ERISA in bad\nfaith and required Respondent to redetermine benefits\nwithin 30 days or face adverse judgment. And Ms. Hardt\nthen secured the full disability benefits after that\ncourt-enforceable order.\nMs. Hardt is entitled to -- is eligible for\na fee award under section 502(g)(1) of ERISA by proper\napplication of this Court's established fee standards\nunder any test this Court has previously established.\nBut to be clear --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do you define as --\nassuming that we go back to our prior language and use --\nin Ruckelshaus, \"some success on the merits,\" what's the\n\"some success on the merits\" that you claim your client\nreached?\nMR. ATES: In that instance, the \"some\nsuccess on the merits\" is the finding of the ERISA\nviolation in this instance.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, I believe that this\ncircuit said, yes, there are cases where we have so held,\nbut that's because there was a cause of action under the\ncomplaint that -- that alleged a violation of the Act.\nBut here there wasn't. Here, there was a claim for\nbenefits only, and you didn't get benefits. That was\nthe circuit's reasoning. So tell me where they erred\nand how we go back to defining \"some success on the\nmerits\" in light of that position by the circuit?\nMR. ATES: They misread the complaint,\nJustice Sotomayor. We are claiming a claim for\nbenefits. As part of that claim, we asked for equitable\nrelief for the ERISA violation. The heart of ERISA is\nthe full and fair review process in 1133 of the statute.\nBecause without a full and fair review by the plan\nadministrator, that fiduciary cannot get to the right\nresult. It violated that obligation here.\nWe asked for the benefits, but the district\ncourt, instead of awarding the benefits, said in the\nfirst -- in the second instance, here's your second bite\nat the apple; get it right this time. That's success on\nthe merits under ERISA, because they must abide by their\nfiduciary obligations, and they breached it here.\nThe relief the district court formulated in\nessence was an equitable-type relief: Do it again. We\nasked for that in the complaint. We asked for equitable\nrelief.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what do you think\nour -- the meaning of our footnote, Chief Justice\nRehnquist's footnote in Ruckelshaus, who said a\nprocedural victory is not some success on the merits.\nHow do you differentiate what he meant by a --\nsome procedural victory is not enough?\nMR. ATES: I think it foreshadowed the\nHanrahan-type case, and we are miles apart from\nHanrahan. Hanrahan, which Respondent is relying upon,\nwas the circuit court reversing the district court on a\npure civil procedure issue. Here, there is a -- a\nright; it is a process right. So when the process right\nis violated, your relief is going to necessarily be\nprocess-driven.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was the same in\nHanrahan. There was a right to a certain process in the\nlower court, and the -- the person complaining achieved\nreversal. It was sent back and said: Do it right. Give\nthis person the process that -- that he's entitled to.\nMR. ATES: But, in Hanrahan, there was no\nfinding of a violation of law, Justice Scalia. Here we\nhave a violation of ERISA, a violation of a fiduciary\nobligation by the plan administrator. The relief\naccorded for that violation was a remand back to the\nplan administrator to get it right.\nThat's the difference between our case and\nHanrahan. In Hanrahan, there was no finding of a\nviolation of law. No one was found to be a legal\nwrongdoer. We have that here. The fiduciary breached\nits obligation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying that in\nHanrahan there was no prod at all from the court, and\nhere there is?\nMR. ATES: I'm sorry --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In Hanrahan, there was no\nprod from the court; the court didn't say anything\nthat -- it was the filing of the complaint that led to\nthe action, wasn't it?\nMR. ATES: Well, what happened was the\ndistrict court, I believe, granted a motion to dismiss or\na motion for judgment as of law at trial. The -- the\ncourt of appeals reversed that. What we have here is a\nprodding from a court, but moreover a finding of a\nviolation by a court. The court found Reliance violated\nERISA. That's the key distinction between here and\nHanrahan. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose now, in response\nto \"Do it right,\" Reliance on a complete record and very\ncareful review finds that total disability was not\nproved. Then there would be no fees, right?\nMR. ATES: No. Under our position, the --\nMs. Hardt is eligible for fees and the district court\ncan take into account trust law principles which are\nembodied in what we call this five-factor test to\ndetermine whether to award fees. She's eligible for\nfees based on the violation by Reliance in bad faith.\nWe have a legal wrongdoer here.\nThe amount of those fees, Justice Ginsburg,\nmay be determined in part by her degree of success.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, this district court\nkept jurisdiction over the action. He more or less\nwaited to see how the story came out before he wrote the\nplot. Suppose the district court said: All you came to\nme for was an order for remand. I give you the order\nfor remand. Case ended. At that point, he doesn't know\nhow it's going to come out. At that point, can he --\ncan the district court award attorney's fees?\nMR. ATES: Absolutely, the court at that\npoint, if he's closing the case out in particular and\nentering judgment as to the violation --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So that even if, when it\ngoes back to Reliance, Reliance finds that it's patently\nfrivolous, close to a fraud, she -- the employee still\ngets the fee?\nMR. ATES: The only way it's going back,\nJustice Kennedy, is from a violation of law. So, in that\nregard, she has succeeded on the merits by proving a\nviolation regardless of the outcome at the end of the\nday.\nNow, here certainly she got the benefits, so\nwe -- we meet even Buckhannon and beyond. But in the\ncase where the district court is sending it back, it\nmust be sending it back for a violation of law, save one\ninstance. The claimant comes forward and says: I have\nadditional evidence that I didn't -- I didn't submit\nbelow. I've got an equitable ground to -- to convince\nthe court to, in essence, reopen the record. I want --\nI want to send it back.\nIn that instance, fees should not be awarded\nbecause it was the claimant's fault in not getting this\nrecord -- this record evidence in.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, she prevailed\nin some way to give her another chance to make that\nargument.\nMR. ATES: Again --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm just saying I\nthink you're giving up too much.\nMR. ATES: Maybe I am, Mr. Chief Justice.\nBut my point is to try to distinguish Hanrahan, in the\nsense that we have a judicial finding of a legal\nviolation here. What I was trying to articulate\nearlier, perhaps inartfully, was that she -- she's\neligible for fees under the five-factor test, but in\nthat instance the district court is not likely to use\nits discretion to grant fees in that instance. I was\nnot --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if you\nget in Justice Kennedy's situation, where the court\ndoesn't know what's going to happen on remand? You\nknow, the objection is -- the administrator throws it\nout, saying, you know, you filed the wrong form, so you\nlose. And the district court says you can't throw it\nout on that basis; under trust law, it doesn't matter.\nAnd it goes back.\nNow, the district court doesn't know what's\ngoing to happen. Does she get fees or not?\nMR. ATES: It -- it depends on what the\ndistrict court does with it. But she has to prove a\nviolation of ERISA for it to go back. And if she proves\nthat, she's eligible for fees. And the district court\nin its discretion can take all these factors into\naccount.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is the district\ncourt -- is the district court supposed to wait until\nthe whole thing is over before deciding the fee\napplication?\nMR. ATES: I think the better practice is\nfor the district court to hold the case over and\nsupervise the remand. But if the district court enters\njudgment at that point, then -- then under Rule 54 or\nthe -- they have to come in and apply for fees within\n14 days of that judgment. But this case does not give\nthis Court an opportunity specifically to give the\ncourts, district courts, guidance whether to keep these\ncases open or not, much like the Social Security cases\nthat happened in the late '80s and early '90s.\nBut to get back to our main point, which is\nthis is not a prevailing party statute, that was the\nfundamental error by the Fourth Circuit in imposing a\nprerequisite to determining whether a claimant is\nentitled to fees. Section 502(g)(1) is not a prevailing\nparty statute for three primary reasons: first, the\nlanguage and structure of the statute. The words\n\"prevailing party,\" a term of art that has been used for\nhundreds of years, is not within section 502(g)(1), but\nit is in other sections of ERISA.\nIts statutory sibling, section 502(g)(2),\ncontains a judgment requirement. Another provision of\nERISA, 1451(e), uses the terms \"prevailing party.\"\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could somebody have\nsome success on the merits if they don't achieve a\njudgment of some sort?\nMR. ATES: This case -- in the -- in the\nBradley case, which was cited in Hanrahan, said you\nhave many final orders in a case, and if the court\ndetermines an issue of -- a particular issue in a\ncase -- and here it's finding an ERISA violation --\nand as relief for that they are issuing an order\nrequiring Reliance to act within 30 days,\nlet's say the case settles at that point.\nThat's enough for fees to issue should the parties not\nbe able to agree on fees as a part of the settlement.\nIt's the judicial act in finding the violation that\ntriggers -- triggers the success on the merits.\nAnd this case was on the merits. As we\npointed out in our very yellow brief, the district\ncourt --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But under your theory,\npresumably no relief has to be granted?\nMR. ATES: Relief does not have to be\ngranted. The district court --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But then what -- what's\nthe difference -- is it your theory that if the district\ncourt -- for whatever reason, if this wasn't an ERISA\ncase where a remand -- or where the court said they did\nviolate, but I've now looked at the evidence that you're\nproffering, the new evidence they did not consider,\nand it's not enough for benefits; you don't get it. Is\nyour argument that you are entitled to fees because they\ndecided there was -- the court decided there was a\nviolation of ERISA?\nMR. ATES: Yes, it is. My argument is you're\neligible for fees, and the amount of fees will be\ntaken into account in determining the degree in the\ndistrict court, taking these five factors into account,\ntaking into effect your position on the merits, the\ndefendant's position on the merits, and determining what\nthat fee award should be. But it should not operate as\na barrier to getting into an eligibility question.\nSo she's eligible for fees in that instance,\nbut what those fees should be is at the district court's\ndiscretion.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Going back to\nJustice Scalia's question, what's the difference between\nHanrahan, where there's a violation of the civil\nprocedure code which is an entitlement to process? Why\naren't you successful, if this is a non-ERISA situation,\nmerely for a finding that the district court acted\nimproperly?\nMR. ATES: Because you have to look at the\nparty who is violating. Here it's the party who's\nviolating the law. It's a party to the suit who is\nviolating the law. That violation is found in Hanrahan.\nIt's a civil procedure. The district court didn't --\ndidn't do something right.\nHere -- and that's not a violation of the --\nof law. That's a -- that's a misapplication of a\ncivil -- of a rule of civil procedure. Here we have a\nviolation of law by a party. That's the fundamental\ndifference between us and Hanrahan.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- ask this\nquestion? The question here is whether there was\neligibility for fees. Could the district judge in your\nview say, yes, I think the plaintiff is eligible for\nfees, but it was actually a very difficult legal issue,\nand the defendant's position was entirely reasonable, so\nI think as a matter of discretion I will not award any\nfees?\nMR. ATES: The district court can exercise\nits discretion and not award fees. I think, however,\nthat the better result is when a violation of law is\nproven, the plaintiff or in this instance a claimant or\nbeneficiary should be entitled to some amount of fees\nbecause the purpose of the statute, explicitly stated in\nthe statute, is to protect beneficiaries and claimants\nand have access to the Federal courts.\nIf every case is a close case and you're\nnot giving -- giving fees, then -- these are folks with\nlimited means. These are folks by definition cannot\nwork when they are disabled, and you are eating up their\nbenefit through attorney's fees. And that cannot be the\npoint of the statute when Congress enacted this. It is\nto protect beneficiaries, to give appropriate -- give\nappropriate relief and keep open access to the Federal\ncourts.\nIf I can get back to, again, why this is not\na prevailing party statute, the language and structure\nclearly show that. The history and context show it as\nwell. And I'm not talking legislative history. I'm\ntalking about the fact that ERISA supplanted the Welfare\nand Pension Plans Disclosure Act, which required a\njudgment before fees could issue, but Congress chose to\nremove that requirement when it originally enacted\nERISA. It does not have that judgment language and does\nnot have prevailing party language.\nMoreover, this Court repeatedly has held\nthat trust law should inform the interpretation of\nERISA. Trust law, for hundreds of years, has taken into\naccount these principles that the district courts and\ncourts of appeals have relied on for at least 30 years\nunder ERISA to inform, guide, and limit district courts'\ndiscretion in awarding fees.\nI'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Shah.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe district court found that Respondent's\noriginal decision denying benefits disregarded pertinent\nmedical evidence in violation of ERISA and found that\nthe decision was otherwise unsupported by substantial\nevidence. Based on those findings, the district court\nordered Respondent to make a new benefits determination,\nafter which Respondent finally granted the benefits due.\nThose facts established Petitioner's\neligibility for a fee award under ERISA section\n502(g)(1), which authorizes a court to award reasonable\nattorney's fees, quote, \"in its discretion,\" end quote.\nThat discretion, as per ERISA more generally, is to be\nexercised in accordance with well-established trust law\nprinciples, and those principles quite clearly reject a\nstrict prevailing party standard.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me\nwhether you differ in your definition of \"some success\non the merits\" than your predecessor colleague? Do you\ndefine it as in the manner he did, that it's any legal\njudgment in the Petitioner's favor that another party\nhas done a wrongful act? I think -- I think I'm\nsummarizing his position accurately.\nMR. SHAH: Yes, I -- I think we are in an\nagreement, Your Honor, with -- with -- with Petitioner's\ncharacterization. When there's a judicial order\nfinding a violation --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, that's different\nthan what he said.\nMR. SHAH: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Yes, here\nthere was an order of remand. That's clear. And I can\nunderstand the difference between an order, because\nthere are many decisions of the court that end up in\norders that are not final judgments. But there are\ndecisions, like this one, I think according to him, that\nif the district court had said there was a violation of\nERISA and the parties then settled without a judicial\norder reflecting that finding and/or requiring a remand,\nI think according to him he would say this party was\nentitled to fees.\nMR. SHAH: I don't want to characterize his\nview, but here's our view on -- on \"some success on the\nmerits.\" If the order -- to be concrete about it, the\norder in this case -- assuming this case, all that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I didn't assume this\ncase.\nMR. SHAH: Pardon?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No order, just a\nfinding.\nMR. SHAH: So there's a finding of an ERISA\nviolation, period?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And then a settlement.\nMR. SHAH: And then a settlement. Well,\nYour Honor, I think it depends on which framework we're\noperating under. I think if we're operating under\nwell-established trust law principles, that clearly\nqualifies as enough success to justify a fee award. And\nwe can look at several of the trust cases cited in both\nour brief and Petitioner's brief. In re Catell's Estate\nis discussed in all the briefs. There the plaintiff\nbrought a claim to remove a trustee, and the basis for\nthe claim to remove the trustee was a contention that\nthe trustee wasn't complying with one of the terms of\nthe trust.\nAfter he filed the suit -- and this was\nbefore even any finding by the judge -- the trustee then\ncomplied with that particular term of the trust. And\nthen what the court said was, well, because the trustee\ncomplied with the underlying premise or the motivation\nfor your suit, I'm going to deny your claim to have the\ntrustee --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that seems like a\ncatalyst theory, and that was, at least in dicta,\nrejected in -- in Ruckelshaus. So how do you deal with\nthat?\nMR. SHAH: Well, it wasn't -- in the dictum\nin Ruckelshaus; it was actually accepted, Your Honor, in\nthat -- in the footnote the Court -- in the dictum within\nRuckelshaus, the Court says quite plainly that Congress,\nin departing from a strict prevailing party language\nin Ruckelshaus, meant to embrace judicial -- relief that\nwasn't encapsulated within a judicial order.\nBut we're far afield from Ruckelshaus here,\nbecause we actually have a judicial order, and we're\nfar afield from the outer limits of the trust --\ntrust law cases which -- which, for example, In re\nCatell's Estate, which I just mentioned -- and by no\nmeans is In re Catell's Estate an outlier. The Third\nCircuit's opinion in Dardovitch, which is also cited in\nour brief, recounts In re Catell's Estate as falling\nwell within the history of trust law cases.\nPetitioner's reply brief at page 11 cites\nGrien v. Cavano. That's another case where a plaintiff\nbrought -- brought a claim that a union fund was not\ncomplying with accounting and proper bookkeeping\nprocedures. After he filed the suit, they fell in line,\nadopted the various procedures that plaintiff had\nsought, and the court still said: Drawing upon trust\nlaw principles, we're going to award fees.\nNow, again, I don't think the court has --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As the Respondent points\nout, the position you're taking is unusual for the\ngovernment. The government is usually arguing against\nfees, because the fees are often assessed against the\ngovernment.\nMR. SHAH: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So long as you know that\nyou're making your bed and you're going to have to lie\nin it --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and you're essentially\nsaying that when there is simply a procedural victory,\nwhich happens all the time, when -- when an agency is --\nis reversed in its procedure even though the -- the --\nthe petitioner here doesn't get any concrete relief\nuntil it goes back to the agency and may lose in the\nagency ultimately, you're -- you're content to say\nthat fees are assessable in that situation, just by\nreason of the procedural victory.\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, a couple of\nresponses: First of all, ERISA is somewhat unique in\nthat ERISA -- first of all, this provision doesn't have\nprevailing party language as -- unlike EAJA, for example.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm talking about other\nprevailing -- I'm talking about other statutes that\ndon't say \"prevailing party.\"\nMR. SHAH: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure.\nMR. SHAH: I think still this provision\nis unique in that it's informed explicitly by trust\nlaw principles, as this Court has held numerous --\nin numerous decisions regarding other ERISA provisions.\nAnd the trust law principles depart from the American\nrule. All of those other statutes which you have in\nmind, Justice Scalia, are premised on the background of\nthe American rule. The trust law departs from American\nrule, and so when you interpret ERISA section 502(g)(1)\nbased upon the trust law principles, I think that\nsupports a different --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm -- I'm -- I'm not sure\nit's reasonable to interpret an attorney's fee provision\nas having anything to do with trust law.\nMR. SHAH: Well, even --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's -- it's a requirement\nof attorney's fees enacted by -- by the Federal\nCongress, and I -- I find that very artificial.\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, it's -- it's a\nfee provision enacted within ERISA which explicitly\nstates as one of its purposes to protect beneficiaries\nand to provide them access to courts. This is in the\nlegislative history.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I can see now\nwhy the red brief has a very substantial appendix with\nstatutes. Now, you say, oh, this is unique. Well, then\nwe may have many, many different kinds of statutes. This\ndoes not provide for -- this is not a prevailing party\nstatute.\nMR. SHAH: Correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But just in going through\nthe list of the statutes, there are many statutes that\nare not prevailing party statutes. And it seems to me\nthat -- you say it's unique. Well, it's unique in the\nsense it's in ERISA, but I -- I think it's very close to\nmany -- many of the statutes with the language there in\nthe red brief's appendix.\nMR. SHAH: Right. And, Your Honor,\npreviously the government has made narrow arguments.\nFor example, there were arguments --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Take the case, though --\njust take the -- what is the government's position? The\nERISA plaintiff wants $5 million. They get denied\neverything. The -- the court says: I noticed here\nthere was a 30-day deadline that you had, and he only\ngave you 28 days, so I'm sending it back, but I'll tell\nyou your claim that there was enough evidence is absurd;\nyou're never going to win it. And then he goes back,\nand he loses it. Okay? He has had a procedural\nvictory.\nDoes he get attorney's fees? Not -- not a\nchance that he's going to win this claim, and, indeed, he\nloses it. He doesn't get a penny. Does he get\nattorney's fees, because on a technicality he won a new\nhearing?\nMR. SHAH: Under your hypothetical, Justice\nBreyer, a district court would be within its\njurisdiction to deny attorney's fees. That doesn't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: My question is --\nMR. SHAH: He wouldn't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- does the statute, in\nthe view of the government, permit attorney's fees in the\ncase I just mentioned?\nMR. SHAH: Probably not in application. He\nwould be eligible, but a district court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your answer is, yes --\nMR. SHAH: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- it does permit?\nMR. SHAH: Yes. But a district court\napplying --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. You're just\nsaying it won't be a problem because the district court\njudges are all reasonable, and I know they think that.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- what if\nthe success is preliminary? You know, the plaintiff\nsurvives a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff survives a\nmotion for summary judgment, wins every procedural\nissue, wins a privilege issue, gets discovery issues\nresolved, and at the end of the day loses? The plaintiff\nhas had --\nMR. SHAH: No, Your Honor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why? He has had\nsome success.\nMR. SHAH: No, Your Honor, because that\nwould be captured within Hanrahan, we think, and\nthat's -- and that's easily distinguishable because\nthose are errors -- even if some of those procedural\nvictories were overturned on appeal or procedural losses\nwere overturned on appeal, those are all errors within\nthe court system or victories within the procedures of\nthe court system, not a violation of -- on the merits of\nthe underlying claim, which is what we have here.\nWe have a finding of a violation of ERISA\nand then relief ordered to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But then, aren't you\ntreating the statute as though it did have a prevailing\nparty clause in it?\nMR. SHAH: Pardon, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is not your construction\none that just treats the statute as though it required\nthe plaintiff to be a prevailing party?\nMR. SHAH: Well -- well, Your Honor, no. I\nthink our -- our -- our argument is to interpret it in\nlight of trust law principles.\nNow, the trust law cases -- there is\nlanguage in some of the trust laws cases that suggests\nthat fees -- fees could be awarded to unsuccessful\nlitigants or regardless of outcome. But I think if you\nread those cases, on the facts of those cases they don't\ngo that far. But I think what they do embody is a much\nbroader notion of success than the strict prevailing\nparty jurisprudence that this Court has promulgated --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under your -- under\nyour rule would it be error for the district court to\nterminate its jurisdiction? It must keep jurisdiction\nto see how the play comes out in the end?\nMR. SHAH: No -- no, Your Honor, I don't\nthink it must keep jurisdiction. But certainly in a\ncase where it does retain --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but it certainly has\nto in order to adopt the ameliorating factors that\nyou -- that you use in order to justify this rule. And\nI -- I -- it's not clear to me that courts usually\nretain jurisdiction in these cases.\nMR. SHAH: May I respond, Your Honor? A\ncouple of responses, Justice Kennedy: First, if they\ndidn't retain jurisdiction -- and in the Seventh\nCircuit, for example, that's one circuit which says that\nthese orders have to be final, and final judgment has to\nbe entered -- then we're exactly analogous to a\nsentence 4 Social Security case.\nAnd this Court has made it clear in a line\nof decisions that upon entry of final judgment -- and\nthose are exactly analogous in the sense that what\nhappens is that the court finds that the decision below\ncommitted some error in law, it vacates that decision,\nand then sends it back to the Social Security\nAdministration for a new determination without\npreordaining the result. Regardless of the result\nthere, at the time of the remand and entry of judgment,\nthat plaintiff is eligible for -- for fees.\nWe think that the same outcome would be\ncontrolled here, even if the Court applied its strict\nprevailing party jurisprudence.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Rosenkranz.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NICHOLAS Q. ROSENKRANZ\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nNo judge has ever decided the merits of\nPetitioner's claim for benefits. Under this Court's\nholding in Ruckelshaus, the Petitioner must demonstrate\nsome success on the merits, and under Rule 54 she must\nspecify the judgment entitling her to an award.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the footnote\nthat was mentioned in Ruckelshaus that said: \"Congress\nfound it necessary to explicitly state that the term\n'appropriate' extended to suits that forced defendants\nto abandon illegal conduct\" -- illegal conduct was found\nhere -- \"although without a formal court order\"?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. Footnote\n8 of Ruckelshaus addressed one sentence of legislative\nhistory of a different statute, and only so far as the\nCourt pointed out that the sentence was of no use to\nSierra Club in that case. I don't think the footnote is\nproperly read to be a full-fledged endorsement of the\ncatalyst theory.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is not merely a\ncatalyst. In Buckhannon, the catalyst theory was\nrejected. Here the court said: If I were to decide\nright now -- the district court said: I am inclined to\nrule for Hardt, but I'm going to give Reliance an\nopportunity to respond.\nSo the court had evaluated the evidence at\nthat point as favoring Hardt. To that extent, it wasn't\na purely procedural ruling. It says: As things stand\nnow, Hardt should get fees; but I'm leaving the door\nopen. So it wasn't just a procedural decision. It was\nan evaluation of the evidence up to that point, wasn't\nit?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, but it\nwould be an utterly unadministrable rule to attempt to\nweigh the inclinations of district judges in their opinions.\nThis Court's precedents have made clear that we weigh\nsuccess on the merits by evaluating judicial judgments.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the judgment is, send\nit back. That's what it says: Send it back. And the\nreason for sending it back is this woman was undergoing\nterrible pain, that the Social Security Administration\nsays she's completely disabled, that she's entitled in\nthe -- on the evidence shown. There's no substantial\nevidence to the contrary. But you, the company, want to\ntake money from her instead of giving her the money.\nNow, I've read the record. It doesn't\nsupport anything contrary to what I've said. So now\nyou send it back. Now, what is that but a big victory\nfor the other side? Which then leaves the company to\nsay: They're right; pay them.\nNow, if that isn't -- I mean, what words of\nEnglish -- if you're -- we're talking about partial success.\nPartial success, or not total defeat. That is the\nlanguage from Ruckelshaus. Not \"total success.\" You\nstill get it. Okay. What in the English language can\nwe read in a case or a statute that would say you\nshouldn't reach that commonsense result? Now, of\ncourse, I'm characterizing it a little bit, but it does\nseem like a commonsense result.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, Petitioner in\nthis case, like all plaintiffs, arrived in court\nrequesting a judgment, a judgment awarding her benefits.\nIndeed, she believed she was entitled to such a judgment\nas a matter of law, and she moved for judgment as a\nmatter of law for summary judgment.\nWhat the district court actually did was\ndeny that motion for summary judgment. Rather than give\nher the judgment she sought, the district court employed\na particular procedural maneuver, which was to remand\nthe case -- quote, \"remand the case\" -- to her\nlitigation adversary to reconsider the question. Now --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: His point -- your\nadversary's point -- is the court couldn't effect that\nprocedural move without taking step one in what was\nrequested. It had to find some sort of violation,\neither to remand or to grant benefits, so that the\nrelief sought, by definition, needed a finding by the\ncourt. And your adversary says the court found an ERISA\nviolation.\nNow, the type of relief it grants is up to\nits discretion. This is an equitable situation, and it\nexercised its discretion by doing a remand. Why is that\nview different than calling it a procedural step? Isn't\nthat a substantive win?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, this is a\npurely interlocutory order. So this was not an end to\nthe case. This was not a decision on the merits. This\nwas a purely interlocutory order, on the road to a\ndecision on the merits, perhaps, but the district court\ndenied her motion for summary judgment, did not conclude\nthat she was entitled to benefits as a matter of law and,\ninstead, remanded the case for further proceedings. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what is the\nimpact on your position of our decision last week in\nConkright v. Frommert? I know you haven't had a chance\nto brief it, but I'm also sure had you a chance to read it.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, Conkright\nemphasizes that these judgments are to be made in the\nfirst instance and, in fact, in the second instance by\nclaims administrators, that that is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought\nthat it -- one thing it did emphasize, that in the\ntypical case, the likely relief is going to be sending\nit back rather than making a judicial decision, which --\nwhich seems to me, then, that -- and then presumably, in\nmost cases, the person would prevail before the plan\nadministrator.\nSo given Conkright, your position is going\nto severely limit the circumstances under which\nclaimants are entitled to fees.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it's -- you are\ncorrect that in Conkright, the Court -- Court indicated\nthat in most cases the district court should remand\nunder circumstances like this. You are quite correct.\nUnder circumstances like this, then, there would be\nfewer opportunities for district courts to award --\nto award fees. And that's a correct result under\n502(g)(1), which, as informed by --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though the --\nas in Conkright, the claimant's success can -- before\nan agreement, can be quite dramatic. This was a very,\nvery significant victory for the claimant to get it sent\nback under those circumstances.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I'm not sure\nthis should be characterized as a victory. This is not\na procedural maneuver that the plaintiff sought. The\nplaintiff asked for summary judgment, and her summary\njudgment motion was denied. And, instead, the district\ncourt chose to remand the case to her litigation\nadversary. Surely, at that moment at least, that surely\ncould not have felt like a victory.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Future claimants will not\nask for summary judgment from the district court,\npresumably, in light of Conkright. They will ask that\nthe case be remanded. So, in future cases, will they\nhave obtained a victory?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I don't think that future\nclaimants will ask for a remand as their final form of\nrelief, Your Honor. This was -- the relief that one asks\nfor in one's complaint is the final judicial relief that\none wants. This is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we've -- we've\nalready told them they can't get that.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, a plaintiff\ncould get an -- could get the relief of benefits if a\nclaims administrator had acted severely improperly or in\nvery bad faith. A district court still has power to\nissue an award on summary judgment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The claimant doesn't --\ndoesn't really claim that. The claimant just says this\nwas a wrong decision and they should do it correctly.\nAnd the claimant knows that all he's going to get from\nthe district court is a remand.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: But the correct way to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So he would not ask for\nmoney and, therefore, would be victorious, on your\nanalysis. If all he asked for was a remand, he got a\nremand.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. A properly\nframed complaint under ERISA should still be a claim for\nbenefits. The -- the remand that Conkright contemplates\nis still an interlocutory remand, like the remand here.\nOne does not put in one's complaint a desire for\ninterlocutory relief, any more than one asks --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If someone wants a remand,\nit's a remand, but on limited grounds; that is, a\nholding of the district court. The ERISA administrator\nwas -- it's an abuse of his discretion to refuse to give\nthis woman nothing. In my opinion, she's entitled at\nleast to $30,000, but whether it's 30 or 35, I don't\nknow. So I remand it to the ERISA administrator so he\ncan decide to act within -- within his discretion, give\nher either 30, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\nNow, in your view, attorney's fees -- all\nthe statute says is the court, in its discretion, may\nallow a reasonable attorney's fee. Nothing more. Now,\nwhat would stop an attorney's fee in that situation?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If that's what you think.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, a remand order\nunder those circumstances might constitute success on\nthe merits because it resolves an issue in the case, which\nwas liability in the case. So that perhaps would constitute\nsuccess on the merits. This resolved no substantive\nissue on the case. This remand order simply says: As a\nprocedural matter, go back and look at it again.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You distinguish between him\nsaying you have to give her at least 30 and his\nsaying the evidence that supports giving her less than\n30 is -- insufficient, is substantially -- is -- what's\nthe word? Yes, worthless.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, this Court\nhas -- this Court has expressly distinguished between\njudicial --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the line you draw?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, the\ndifference between judicial pronouncements and judicial\nrelief is one that this Court has --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That -- that's\ndifficult. Let's assume that a claims administrator or a\nplan administrator is not deciding the claim. The party\ncomes to court and says: Under ERISA, I have a right to a\ndecision within X number of days; force them, mandamus\nthem to give me a decision. The court says: Reasonable;\nyou have a right to one. And orders them to.\nUnder your theory, they've won nothing?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, in your\nhypothetical the -- the remand order would presumably be\na final judgment, and it might well constitute success\non the merits.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you're -- you're --\nwait a minute. Then we go back to a question that was\nasked by one of my colleagues. If a plan participant\ncame in and said they didn't consider evidence they\nshould have; they didn't seek my treating physician's\ndocuments, and here they are; they should consider them\nnow, and the court says you're right, enters a\nremand order, and dismisses the case -- that's enough?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I'm not sure\nthat's a properly formatted ERISA complaint. If the\ngravamen of the complaint is \"I want my benefits\" then --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, what -- what's\nthe difference between the first example I gave, a\nmandamus to issue a decision -- that's not a claim for\nbenefits, either; it's a claim for a decision. What's\nthe difference between that and the second hypothetical?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: If the -- if the gravamen\nof the complaint is a complaint for benefits, then the\ncomplaint should ask for benefits, and the judge should\nresolve that case. A remand would always maintain\njurisdiction -- should always maintain jurisdiction over\nthe case, thus always be interlocutory and procedural.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that how it\nworks? Remands always retain jurisdiction? I would --\nI would have thought the district judge would want the\nthing off his or her docket, you know, for the\nstatistics, if anything. And --\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and would say,\nand maybe could say -- well, what if the judge says:\nLook, I don't know if you're going to prevail or not\non remand. My decision actually doesn't help you much\none way or the other, but if you get benefits, then the\nother side is liable for attorney's fees, and I assume\nyou'll be able to work out the amount. If you don't,\nhe's done. End of case. Sent back to the\nadministrator.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, on the research\nthat we have done, most district courts hold\njurisdiction on remands such as this, and we believe\nthat is the proper course. When the case -- the gravamen of\nthe case is a complaint for benefits, the district court\nmerely remands to the ERISA claims administrator, the\nmerits of the case simply have not been decided.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That may be, but why can't\nthey do this? What would be wrong with this heretical\nidea, that as long as the plaintiff wins something out\nof the court, the district judge -- that group of people\nwe were talking about -- has discretion to decide\nwhether ultimately they got something significant of\nwhat they wanted, and as long as that judgment helped\nthem get them something significantly of what they\nwanted, attorney's fees are fine; and we leave it all up\nto the district judge as long as the district judge\ndoesn't abuse the discretion that that standard gives\nhim?\nWhat would -- I mean, would the Earth come\nto an end? What would happen that would be so terrible\nif we said something like that?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I believe that\nwould be to embrace the catalyst theory that this Court\nrejected in 2000 --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It didn't say anything\nagainst the catalyst theory. It said you have to\nremember this is an American country, we follow the\nAmerican rule, and there has to be something special in\nthe situation. And what would be special in this\nsituation is that the judge has to decide that as a\nresult of the favorable ruling, the plaintiff really did\nget something significantly of what she wanted.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the Court was\ncareful in Ruckelshaus to say that a purely procedural\nvictory would not suffice. Now, purely procedural\nvictory may well -- may well result in success for a\nplaintiff at some later stage; it could result in\nout-of-court success. This Court has been crystal clear\nthat we do not look for success out of court; we don't\nlook for it in interlocutory orders --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rosenkranz, suppose\nthe complaint was: I asked for a turnover of certain\ndocuments; they refused without reason. And the court\nsays: You're right; you're entitled to those\ndocuments.\nIt's interlocutory; there is no decision;\nbut the only thing that the plaintiff asked for the\nplaintiff got, that is entitlement to the documents.\nThe court said: You are entitled to the documents.\nAnd then it goes back, and the documents are turned over\nbecause the court has ordered that.\nUnder your theory, because there was no\ndetermination of benefits, even that ruling which was a\ntotal victory for the plaintiff doesn't open the door to\nfees.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: On your hypothetical, Your\nHonor, that would not be an interlocutory order. So if\na plaintiff arrives seeking only documents and the\ndistrict court awards her, her documents, that would be\nthe end of the case, and the district court would\nproperly relinquish jurisdiction, and we could evaluate,\ncompare the result that the district court gave -- gave\na plaintiff with what the plaintiff originally asked\nfor. But this is not such a case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that would fall --\neven if in the end of the -- at the end of the day no --\nno award is made? No benefits are awarded?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it might be\nproper to frame a complaint under ERISA for a purely\nprocedural remedy like some documents. That is not the\nmain run of ERISA cases. So in the normal case, a\npetitioner arrives -- a plaintiff arrives asking for\nbenefits. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- but you say --\nyou called it purely procedural and you said yes, but\nthat's the only thing that she asked for. So she got it.\nSo she qualifies for fees. Even though you just\ncharacterized it as purely procedural, it's a purely\nprocedural ruling, but it's all she asked for --\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- so she gets benefits.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: -- I'm not sure that\na properly framed ERISA complaint would be -- would\nbe for a purely procedural result. If one could frame\nan ERISA claim like that, which I think is extremely --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I'm not dealing\nwith something obscure. If the -- the plaintiff says, I\nhave asked for certain documents, they withheld those\ndocuments with no good cause at all, and the court said:\nYou're right; turn over documents.\nIt's that hypothetical. It's just --\nthat's the situation. There is a final order: Turn over\nthe documents. But it's a procedural order, right?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, nonetheless, benefits\nwould be -- nonetheless, fees would be available?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, our position is\nthat in this case the remand order was both purely\nprocedural and interlocutory. So it fails under both\nthose grounds. On your hypothetical, the -- the order\nwould be a final order, but presumably still purely\nprocedural, and so perhaps not success on the merits\neven on that hypothetical.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're changing -- you're\nchanging the answer. The answer that you first gave\nme was it's a discrete issue -- final judgment, yes,\nqualifies for fees. Now you're saying no, no fees?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it would\nqualify in the sense that it would be a final judgment,\nnot an interlocutory order. Whether that's properly\ncharacterized as a purely procedural victory or not, I'm\nnot sure. Most ERISA claims are not framed that way.\nThey are usually framed as claims for benefits, not for\npurely procedural --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the claim were:\nThey're just not processing my application. So, Court,\norder them to process my application. Right; they're\nnot doing anything; we order then to go process the\napplication. End of case in the district court.\nFee entitlement?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Again, Your Honor, that\nwould perhaps be best characterized as a purely\nprocedural victory even though it's a final judgment and\neven though it's what the plaintiff sought. Again, in\nthis case, this order was purely interlocutory, and so\nit's a much easier case. This -- in this case, this was\na procedural step on the road to a final judgment. This\nwas not a final judgment at all and not at all what the\npetitioner sought.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The government in response\nto questions about the significance and the consequences\nof its position said, oh, this is a unique statute.\nERISA -- it's is an ERISA statute.\nDo you agree that if -- if we rule for you,\nit would be applicable primarily to ERISA and it\nwouldn't have an effect on these other statutes?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Justice Kennedy, I\ndon't. The Court has oftentimes emphasized that\nfee-shifting statutes ought to be read in parallel, that\nwe ought to have fewer rather than more fee-shifting\nstandards in the world. And so, presumably, the result\nin this case would govern any number of fee-shifting\nstatutes of similar language.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the\nparties -- to follow up on Justice Ginsburg's line of\nquestioning, what if the parties decide, look, this case\nrises or falls on the discovery issue? If we have to go\nthrough discovery, it's going to cost us a lot more than\nto pay you. So we stipulate whatever the ruling is on\ndiscovery will decide the issue.\nIn that case, can the party -- can the\nclaimant get fees?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: I'm sorry, Your Honor. In\nthis hypothetical, the district court grants the\ndiscovery order, but the -- but still holds jurisdiction\nover the case?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it grants the\ndiscovery order, and as a result, a direct result of that\nruling, the plan pays benefits.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. I believe\nthat this Court has rejected the direct results theory\nand has instructed us to look at the content of judicial\njudgments, not at their ancillary effects on parties out\nin the world.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what is the\ndifference between prevailing party and some success\non the merits for you? The only difference is whether\nthey won on one cause of action as opposed to four?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, in Ruckelshaus,\nthe Courts emphasized that omitting words like\n\"prevailing party\" or \"success\" from a statute is\nsignificant, but it's not revolutionary, that what it\naccomplishes is a decrease in the quantum of success\nrequired -- the degree, I believe was the Court's\nlanguage -- but not the type of success required. But\nit was still --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So under Buckhannon, 51\npercent only entitles you to fees. And under your view\nof this statute, you have -- as long as you get\n1 percent order, that's enough.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the -- the Court\nin Ruckelshaus was speaking of the interpretation of\n\"prevailing party\" that -- that held sway in circuit\ncourts in the 1970s.\nAt that time, \"prevailing party\" had been read\nquite narrowly to require substantially prevailing, and\nthe Court understood Congress to reject that standard in\nadopting a statute that doesn't include language like\n\"prevailing party.\" Subsequently, this Court has\nadopted a much more liberal understanding of the words\n\"prevailing party,\" so there may not be --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you -- you see no\ndifference today?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: There may still be a\ndifference, but it will be a smaller difference and a\ndifference only in quantity, certainly not a difference\nin type. The result -- the success still has to be\nsuccess that you can find in a judgment of a court.\nYour Honors, if I could -- Your Honors, as\na matter of policy, the plaintiffs have argued that this\nwill result in -- that -- I'm sorry. As a matter of\npolicy, the plaintiffs -- or the Petitioner's rule would\nresult in a second major litigation over attorney's\nfees, and this Court has rejected any such rules. The\nconcern is that the fee-shifting inquiry ought to be\nsimple and easy to administer.\nThe ease of administrability of our rule is\nthat it turns on the contents of judicial judgments. If\nthe Petitioner wins in this case, the policy result will\nmerely be stingier plans. So these are not plans that\nany private party is obliged to create, and this Court\nhas emphasized that the purpose of ERISA is to balance\nthe interests of beneficiaries, on the one hand, but also\nthe interest in the creation of these plans and the\ngenerosity of these plans, on the other. And a fee award\nunder circumstances like this would result in far less\ngenerous plans for -- for --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?\nYou rely very heavy on Ruckelshaus, which of course was\na case in which the fees were sought to be imposed against\nthe government.\nIs there a basis for distinguishing on a\nsort of a sovereign immunity approach for saying that\nmaybe there should be a stricter standard when you're\ntaking money away from the sovereign than when you're\ntaking it away from private litigants?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I don't think\nso. The Solicitor General is here arguing that this\nought to be the rule, and it would presumably be the\nsame rule even in a statute that applied against the\ngovernment. Again, this Court has cautioned against a\nproliferation of different fee-shifting standards. I\nwould think there would be a concern about having a\ndifferent standard applied to the government than to a\nprivate party on -- on similar statutory text.\nCertainly, no indication in this statutory text --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's a trust -- trust\nlaw is at issue here, is the government's assertion.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I agree with\nyou that it seems artificial in a way to apply those --\nto apply -- to import those principles entirely. On the\nother hand, this Court has emphasized that ERISA is\ninformed by trust principles. And under Sprague, the\nCourt emphasized that trust principles would very rarely\nshift fees in a context like this. So to that extent, I\ndo believe that this provision should be informed by\nthis Court's holding on that point.\nJust to re-emphasize, Your Honors, what\nactually happened in the district court below: So the\nPetitioners sought judgment as a matter of law for\nbenefits, and that motion was denied. Instead, she\nreceived an interlocutory procedural order, a remand to\nher adversary, a private party in litigation, to\nconsider the question again.\nAnd, as this Court emphasized, the second\ninquiry by the claims administrator would be reviewed\nfor abuse of discretion. It could easily have come out\nthe other way, as the district court itself\nacknowledged.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You also received -- she\nalso received a conditional judgment in her favor.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: The district court\nspecified that if Reliance did not comply with this\nprocedural --\nJUSTICE BREYER: She said: Unless this\norder goes into effect within 30 days, the judgment will\nbe entered for the plaintiff, for her -- for her.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. That's\ntrue, but I don't think that distinguishes this from --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, she got one judgment\nin her favor. It was a conditional judgment. I mean,\nif we're being technical, if we're going to just do\nthis totally on some kind of procedural theory of what's\na judgment, what's a judgment in your favor, and we just\ndon't want to look to the merits of it and see what\nreally happened, then why doesn't she win? Because she\ngot a judgment in her favor, okay? End of the matter.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, she didn't\nactually get a judgment. She got a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, let's read the\njudgment. Let's see. It says -- it says judgment. It\nsays in a -- what is it called? I just saw it here.\nMy colleague had it here.\nIt says -- I think this it. It says \"Conclusion\"\n-- it says -- and it's in the conclusion, and\nit says what happens. And it says it denies, denies,\ndenies, denies. And then it says: \"Reliance to act on\nMs. Hardt's application, adequately considering all the\nevidence, within 30 days. Otherwise, judgment will be\nissued in favor of Mrs. Hardt.\"\nNow, that's in a kind of judgment, I guess.\nIt's in an order. So an order saying we'll issue a\njudgment -- it sounds to me like you could say that's a\njudgment in her favor. You don't have to, but you\ncould.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I think that's\nonly -- the district court was only saying what is\nimplicit in most all procedural orders --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. Normally, a judge -- a\njudge doesn't say: It is ordered that if you do not\nact within 30 days, there will be a judgment entered in\nflavor of the plaintiff. That's not a usual thing.\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: But, Your Honor, if a party\nignores the procedural order of a district court, it\ndoes so often on peril of default. So it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm just saying, if we're\ngoing to be formal and we're going to look to certain\nwords included in -- in certain papers, irrespective of\nwhat really happened, don't we have those words in the\npaper that's relevant here?\nMR. ROSENKRANZ: Again, Your Honor, the\ndistrict court did not decide the merits of this case.\nThe district court offered the possibility that it would\nenter judgment if something happened in the future.\nThat thing did not happen in the future. There was\nno judgment in her favor in this case. Again, the issue\nwas remanded to a private party to determine the issue.\nThe grant of benefits on remand certainly could not\nconstitute success on the merits.\nThat was not judicial action at all. That\nwas the action of a private party. Purely voluntary\naction. Certainly, couldn't constitute a judgment under\nRule 54. And then when the case arrived back at the\ndistrict court, the district court did the only thing\nthat it was left to do, which was to dismiss the case.\nAnd those are the actual actions the\ndistrict court took: denying the motion for summary\njudgment and dismissing the case. And under this\nCourt's precedents, where we look for success is in those\njudgments. Those judgments show us no success on the\nmerits for Ms. Hardt.\nIf there are no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Ates, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. ATES\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ATES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI have two points on rebuttal: Under their\nwe must have a final judgment on the benefits on her\nclaim for -- final judgment on the merits on her claim\nfor benefits, that is absolutely foreclosed by this\nCourt's decision in Schaefer, where a Social Security\nclaimant comes forward, shows a violation by the\nSecretary; it's remanded back to the Secretary; the case\nis closed at that point. There was no decision on the\nmerits for the benefits, and yet this Court found that\nwas prevailing party.\nHere, we don't need prevailing party, but\nmoreover, even accepting their theory, it leads to absurd\nresults. There is a provision in ERISA, 1132(c),\nthat gives a claimant the right to seek documents. And\nyet, they are saying if the claimant is wholly\nsuccessful to get the plan document from which certain\nclaims you don't even know if you have until you read\nthose plans, they would say it's a purely procedural\nvictory; you cannot get attorney's fees. The whole\npoint of that provision was to require the fiduciary to\ngive the document over so people can understand their\nrights.\nMoreover, their final judgment on the merits\nfor benefits rule leads to perverse incentives under\nERISA. The plan administrator is incented to deny the\nfirst time around, challenge it all the way through the\ncourts, on remand maybe, if they get a conditional\njudgment, as here, that says if you don't act within\n30 days I'm giving you that judgment, they then grant\nthe benefits and the court gets rid of the case, they\nhave succeeded in eliminating the right\nof claimants to get to court to pursue their rights,\nbecause of the cost of litigation.\nBut moreover, here we have a judgment. To\nbe clear, that is not our argument. We had a\nconditional judgment by the district court sending it\nback: If you do not act in accordance with law within\n30 days, I will enter judgment on this case.\nWe have that, but at the end of the day,\nit was not a dismissal. They overlooked district court\ndocket 57. There was a judgment entered in Ms. Hardt's favor\nagainst Reliance in the amount of attorney's fees. The\noriginal order merges into that judgment. We have a\nfinal judgment here as well. Although we don't need it\nunder section 502(g)(1), we have it here.\nThis Court should not require a judgment\nbefore fees can be awarded. The whole -- and it\ncertainly shouldn't adopt a purely procedural rule out\nof thin air that's not in the statute. This is a\nprocedural statute. The only way claimants can\neffectuate their right is ensuring the procedure is\nfollowed. That is what we have here.\nThey did not follow proper procedure. They\nabused their discretion. They breached a fiduciary\nobligation to the claimant. In these circumstances,\nunder the clear language and clear structure of this\nstatute, this claimant is entitled to fees.\nThe only -- may I finish?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMR. ATES: The only issue that Reliance\ncontested was whether she was a prevailing party. Knock\nthat leg of the stool, their case fails.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
