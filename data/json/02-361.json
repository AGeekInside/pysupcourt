OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nWhen libraries block Internet pornography from\ntheir computer terminals, they are simply declining to put\nonto their computer screens the same content they have\ntraditionally excluded from their bookshelves. By\noffering Internet access without pornography, freedom of\nspeech is expanded, not abridged. Under the Children's\nInternet Protection Act, or CIPA, no Internet speech is\nprohibited, inhibited, threatened, or chilled. Libraries\nare simply exercising their discretion as to the content\nthat their libraries will contain, the historic discretion\nto exercise that -- that authority, and to how their\nlibrary resources will be used.\nQUESTION: Mr. Olson, you have a number of\nimportant legal concepts to address. I have three factual\nquestions. I've been through the extensive opinion of the\ndistrict court, and -- and they may be important for me.\nThree different things.\nWhen the library patron requests that the filter\nbe disabled, does he have to explain why he wants it\ndisabled?\nMR. OLSON: No. Shall I wait until you've\nasked --\nQUESTION: Go ahead.\nMR. OLSON: It's my understanding that the --\nthe library patron would not have to explain any reason\nwhy he was asking a site to be unblocked or the filtering\nto be disabled.\nQUESTION: That's the next question. Do you ask\nsite by site or can I -- can the library patron say,\nunblock the whole thing?\nMR. OLSON: The library patron, if the patron is\nan adult, can ask the -- the entire filtering to be\ndisabled, and the library may disable -- I mean, eliminate\nthe filtering with respect to specific sites either on\ntheir own or at the request of a patron.\nQUESTION: All right.\nAnd third, the district court said in some cases\nit takes 24 hours to a week. Is that the usual thing or\ndoes -- in many cases can the librarian just push a\nbutton?\nMR. OLSON: I think that it is -- it is -- the\nrecord is not clear on that, and I -- but my -- my\nexperience and my judgment in connection with our\npreparation is that it need not be a very difficult thing.\nIt's something that libraries can do without a great deal\nof difficulty. But to the extent that it took any time at\nall, it would be the same as asking for a book that is not\non the shelf or asking for an inter-library loan, the kind\nof customary things that library patrons do when they ask\nfor a book or a resource in a library.\nQUESTION: Is -- is there anything in the\nstatute that would prohibit a library from doing the\nfollowing? Any adult who wants to watch the thing without\nthe screen, come up and ask, do you want to do it, and you\n-- we can tell you, don't watch these obscene child\npornography, et cetera. Then we disconnect it. Does the\nstatute prohibit the library from doing that?\nMR. OLSON: If I understand your question\ncorrectly, I -- I know of nothing in the statute that\nwould prohibit the library from doing that, provided that\nthe -- the person asks and the patron asking is an adult.\nThe First Amendment does not require libraries\nto sponsor the viewing of pornography. When Government\ngives financial aid to speech on Government premises, it\nmay make rational choices as to what not to finance.\nThose -- that -- that doctrine is consistent with this\nCourt's previous decisions. In connection with this\nparticular content, Congress and this Court have found\nthat Government has -- the Government has a compelling\ninterest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity,\nchild pornography, and in the case of minors, material\nthat is harmful to children. Such material has been\ntraditionally excluded from public libraries, and\nGovernment has a basic, fundamental right in addition not\nto associate with or finance pornography.\nQUESTION: Isn't part of the problem that a lot\nmore is being excluded? I mean, as I understand it, the\nstatute requires that a -- a filter of some sort be used.\nFilters are not sold -- the blocking devices are not sold\nor prepared apparently in terms of the concepts that the\nstatute uses. The companies that do prepare them will not\neven disclose what in fact they are blocking so that it\nseems that an inevitable price of this is blocking more\nthan -- than the statute requires, and that's even without\ngetting into the question of blocking material for adults\nas -- as opposed -- that -- that might be unsuitable for\nchildren, but certainly aren't for adults.\nHow do you -- how do you get over the problem of\nthe -- sort of the -- the imprecision, the crudity, the\noverkill of the blocking devices?\nMR. OLSON: Justice Souter, that is -- that is\ntrue that any system is going to involve some over-\nblocking and under-blocking because it's impossible to\nknow what is going to be coming over the Internet or\nimpossible to make systems that are perfect. But that's\nconsistent with what -- the historical decisions that\nlibraries have made.\nQUESTION: But there's one thing that is clearly\ninconsistent I think, and that is when the libraries make\n-- historically have made these decisions, they've known\nwhat they weren't buying or weren't stocking on their\nshelves, and here they don't --\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nQUESTION: -- because they -- the blocking\nmakers regard that as proprietary information.\nMR. OLSON: It's -- there's several answers to\nthat it seems to me. In the first place, libraries have\nknown that they have not stocked pornography, and it's not\nbecause of space, popularity, or expense. They have\nchosen traditionally not to stock that type of material.\nEvery time a library decides not to subscribe to a\nmagazine, it is over-blocking in a sense. A magazine may\nhave three pornographic pictures in it or sexually\nexplicit pictures in --\nQUESTION: But it -- but it does know what the\nmagazine is, and here it does not know what the website\nis.\nMR. OLSON: It knows what the magazine has been.\nIt may not know what the magazine is in the future.\nFurthermore, librarians don't read every book.\nQUESTION: No, but it -- you know, it knows it's\nPlayboy or whatever the magazine is, and here it doesn't\nknow what the website is that's being excluded.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, but it can -- it can test this\n-- what we're saying here with respect to that is over-\nblocking or under-blocking is a necessary part of the\nlibrary function of making appropriateness judgments with\nrespect to content generally. That's the type of\ndistinction --\nQUESTION:\nwith that. It -- it seems to me a large part of your\nargument is you want us to think of this just in the same\ncontext of the librarian going through a list of books and\ndeciding what books to buy. But the Internet isn't like\nthat. What is it? There's a -- 1.5 million new entries\ninto the system every day? This is a whole new medium.\nIt's not like a library.\nMR. OLSON: Yes. And, Justice Kennedy, it seems\nto -- it seems to the Government and it seemed -- it\nseemed to Congress that gross judgments are going to have\nto be made. These libraries, as the record reflects and\nthe findings of the district court reveal, traditionally\nor -- or customarily block e-mail, chat, gambling, gaming,\ndating services, and some of them, as reflected -- I think\nit's on page 37, 38 of the appendix to the jurisdictional\nstatement -- make -- make judgments with respect to what's\nappropriate, what's offensive. Those types of judgments\nare being made.\nYes, this is a new medium and it's --\nQUESTION: Well, but General Olson, there are\nsupposed to be 90,000 books a year published in the United\nStates. Do you think librarians know the contents or even\nknow of the existence of all of those 90,000 books?\nMR. OLSON: No, that -- Mr. Chief Justice,\nthat's our point.\nit is not a difference generically from what libraries\ntraditionally have done.\nQUESTION: But when the library makes a book\ndecision, doesn't it make a decision that says, we will\nnot put God's Little Acre on our shelves? It's a yes or\nno decision with respect to the book. It's quite true\nthere are lots of books out there that the library not --\nmay not know about, but when it makes a decision not to\nput it on the shelf, it knows what it's deciding not to\ndo, and here it doesn't.\nMR. OLSON: Well, in a specific situation, a\nlibrary might know that. A library might decide that it\nwould just stock history books or just stock -- stock\nnovels of a particular period. There's nothing to suggest\nthat libraries don't have the right to make those\ndecisions and customarily make those decisions.\nQUESTION: Sure, but somebody along the line\nknows what they've decided to buy within the category and\nwhat they haven't decided to buy.\nMR. OLSON: Well, that's right, but the\ntraditional decisions that libraries have made -- and the\nappellees do not dispute this -- is that libraries have\nnot chosen to stock the types of material on their shelves\nthat they're now being asked to keep out with respect to\nthe Internet.\nmedium.\nQUESTION: No, but that's -- that's true. But I\nthink the thing that -- one of the things that's troubling\nus is they're -- they're -- they are -- they are forced,\nby virtue of that decision, not to stock a lot of other\nmaterial, and they don't even know what it is and there's\nno way for them to find out.\nMR. OLSON: But, Justice Souter, they -- they\nmay on their own -- there's a -- there's -- one of the\nmaterials that's in the record is someone that made a\nstudy of several hundred thousand sites and decided which\nones were properly blocked or improperly blocked. Those\ntypes of studies may be used to unblock sites, to modify\nthe filtering system. Libraries could get together and\ncreate their own filtering system rather than the ones\nthat are --\nQUESTION: Could the library in -- General\nOlson, in view of what you answered earlier, you said any\npatron could say, I want to unblock everything. Could the\nlibrary say, well, we want our staff to have access to\neverything? Therefore, we are going to unblock everything\nfor the computers that we use internally. I thought the\nanswer to that question was no, but it seems inconsistent\nwith the answer that you gave. A patron says, I want to\nsee everything. Fine.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I -- I believe that the answer\nis that, A, the librarian can, in response to a request\nfrom a patron, unblock the filtering mechanism altogether.\nAnd secondly, I think it's not entirely -- it's not -- the\nstatute doesn't get into it, but it -- but it seems\nentirely consistent with what I've just said, and I think\nconsistent with the import of your question is that the\nlibrary staff can disable the filter in order to make\njudgments about whether something has been, quote,\nproperly or improperly blocked.\nQUESTION: Because one of the things that was\ncriticized about this statute was that every terminal,\neven the ones in the librarian's own office, closed\noffice, has to have this filtering. But your answer is,\nno, they don't. You -- you make it sound like it's really\nthe library's option. If they want to put everything on,\nthey can.\nMR. OLSON: I -- I was answering your question\nwith respect to what the staff may review in making the\nadministrative decisions with respect to unblocking or\nother decisions with respect to the implementation of the\nstatute. The statute speaks in terms of having in place\nthis technological mechanism by which this material can be\nfiltered out or is designed and calculated to do that. It\ndoesn't -- the statute does not require perfection. It\ndoesn't require librarians to act in --\nQUESTION: General Olson, if I understand the\nsituation correctly, the libraries are wasting a lot of\nmoney litigating. They could simply hire somebody to come\ninto the library everyday and say, please unblock\neverything, and then they could do it.\nMR. OLSON: With respect to that patron. I\nmean, the -- the -- if my answer suggested that the\nlibrary could just switch off the filter on a daily basis,\nI didn't mean to say anything remotely like that.\nQUESTION: Oh, okay.\nMR. OLSON: It -- this -- particular patrons may\nsay, I'm investigating breast cancer. This -- the sites\n-- some of the sites that I'm looking for I can't find,\nand they appear to be on block. Can those sites -- or\nI've heard about these sites -- be unblocked?\nQUESTION: But do they have to --\nQUESTION: Or -- or he can say, according to\nyou, what do you care what I'm investigating? I just want\nthe site unblocked. Isn't that right?\nMR. OLSON: That's -- that's correct. Yes,\nthat's correct.\nQUESTION: I wonder how -- how effective that --\nthat system is in -- in achieving some of the goals of the\nstatute which -- which is not just that -- that some\npeople using the -- the Net happen to stumble across\npornographic stuff but also, passing by, see it, and --\nand including children.\nMR. OLSON: That -- that may happen, Justice\nScalia. The system is not perfect. It is not going to be\nperfect. But what it does, it's a reasonable, rational\narticulation by Congress of an attempt to decide --\nQUESTION: Why couldn't the -- why couldn't the\nchildren be protected by having two screens? One screen\nfor the kids; the other for the adults. One is blocked;\nthe other isn't.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I think that is -- again, is a\npractical judgment that may work in some libraries. It\nmight require a great deal more resources from librarians.\nIt might require establishing different screens and\nmechanisms. Yes, there are ways in which Congress could\nhave done this differently, but this is a rational\njudgment, consistent with --\nQUESTION: May I go back to Justice Ginsburg's\nquestion with respect to the library staff on the\nunblocking? I -- I think her original question was, could\nthe library say, we want our staff to have free access on\nthe computers that they use, not that we want them to be\nable to look behind the block to see what's being kept\nout. We just want them to have a free computer. Is -- is\nthat a violation of the statute? I had thought it was --\nMR. OLSON: I think that the -- my answer to\nyour question, if I understand it correctly, is that the\ncomputers in the library, if the library uses the -- the\nFederal funds with either respect to the discounts or the\nsubsidies, direct subsidies, all the computers in that\nlibrary must be equipped with the technology protection\nmeasure with respect to each of those computers.\nQUESTION: And that would include the staff\ncomputers.\nMR. OLSON: Yes. But that does not preclude the\nstaff from determining, in connection with specific\nrequests --\nQUESTION: Yes, but that's not the question.\nThe question is can the library say, this is ridiculous\nblocking this stuff for our staff. We're not going to\nblock them. The staff computers are either going to have\nno blocks or every morning we will press the button that\nunblocks the staff computers.\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nQUESTION: That would violate the statute,\nwouldn't it?\nMR. OLSON: Well, one could -- you're in an\narea, it seems to me, that -- where there might be an as-\napplied challenge.\nto the constitutionality of the statute.\nQUESTION: And we want to know the extent of the\nstatutory prohibition.\nMR. OLSON: I -- I understand that. I -- and\nthe -- your -- the import of your question suggests that\nin this situation a librarian might exercise this\ndiscretion with respect to a filter. I don't think in the\nfirst place --\nQUESTION: All I want to know is whether they\ncan do it without violating the statute.\nMR. OLSON: My answer to your question is that\nto the extent that librarians are disabling the filter for\nthe performance of their administrative function --\nQUESTION: That's not my question. The library\nsimply says, we want our staff to have free computers.\nMR. OLSON: I don't think so, Justice Souter.\nQUESTION: That would violate it.\nMR. OLSON: That's right. But remember, this is\nin the context of -- of material that's been traditionally\nexcluded by libraries, that libraries are free to put on\ntheir shelves in the form of books anytime they want.\nIt -- the -- the position of the district court\nand the position of the appellees is that the libraries,\nby doing this, violate the First Amendment right of their\npatrons.\ncontext, and we're suggesting that the patrons have a\nright to Internet access anywhere they want outside the\nfederally subsidized library.\nAnd the library has several choices it may make\nhere. The library might not have Internet. Maybe it's\nnot appropriate for that particular library. The library\nmay have Internet with the filtering and accept Federal\nmoney with respect to putting in the computers. Or the\nlibrary --\nQUESTION: Could the library do this? Could the\nlibrary say, okay, we're -- we're certainly going to\ncomply with the statute for the library, but we are going\nto -- we are going to establish -- or the city says, we\nwill establish a separate office? It's called the -- the\ncomputer viewing office. It has a separate budget from\nthe library. It's in a separate building. It has a\nseparate staff. Administratively it's different. And\nwith respect to the computers in -- in that establishment,\nwe're not going to ask for any Federal subsidies and the\ncomputers are going to be wide open. Any reason they\ncouldn't do it?\nMR. OLSON: I -- I think they could. They could\neither have a separate branch where separate Federal funds\nare not being obtained, or you're talking about a separate\nadministrative ability --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: -- facility. I don't -- I don't\nbelieve that the statute would prohibit that set of\noperations.\nQUESTION: Yes, but it would apply if they had,\nsay, ten computers and nine of them were financed by the\nFederal subsidy and one of them was independently\nfinanced. That one would be covered by the statute.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, it would, Justice Stevens,\nalthough --\nQUESTION: And if you rely on the -- on the\nSpending Clause to justify this restriction, how do you --\nhow does that justification apply to that tenth computer?\nMR. OLSON: Because it's a reasonable condition\nto the operation of the funds. In the first place,\nJustice Stevens, in -- the Internet is going to come\nthrough one opening, and the -- the various different\ncomputers will be plugged up to that one opening so that\nthe -- the technological answer in part to your question\nis it's -- the -- the library would have to decide --\nQUESTION: Well, you -- you could have it on a\nseparate phone line, it seems to me.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, the library could do that sort\nof thing, but it would --\nQUESTION:\nMR. OLSON: Yes, it would. Yes, it would.\nQUESTION: And how do you justify that under the\nSpending Clause?\nMR. OLSON: We believe that it's a reasonable\ncondition that Congress reasonably -- the patrons may not\nbe able to distinguish where the --\nQUESTION: Well, wouldn't it be equally\nunreasonable if we said it applies to separate facilities\ntoo? I don't know why -- I don't understand the\ndistinction between a branch library that has one computer\nin it and a big central library with 10 computers, one of\nwhich is separately financed.\nMR. OLSON: Well, again, as we said in our\nbriefs, that to the extent that that is an issue, it\nshould be made -- that point should be made in a -- in an\nas-applied challenge to the statute, as opposed to a\nchallenge on the face. We don't think it's\ntechnologically going to be a problem and we do think that\nCongress can reasonably have assumed we're using Federal\nmoney to finance Internet in this library. Patrons are\ngoing to be exposed. If you're going to take the money,\nwe would like patrons not to be exposed in this manner to\nthat material, and the Congress could well have decided\nthat it -- the taxpayers don't want to be associated with\na subsidy of that types of material -- that type of\nmaterial which has traditionally been excluded from the\nlibraries in any event.\nQUESTION: Well, you're saying not only that\nthey -- that they don't want to be associated with the\nsubsidizing of it, but they -- you're saying they don't\nwant to subsidize an operation which includes some non-\nsubsidized material of this sort. Don't you have to say\nthat in --\nMR. OLSON: I -- well, I think that that would\nbe a reasonable choice for Congress to make.\nQUESTION: You say they've made it.\nMR. OLSON: Well, with respect to all of the\ncomputers in the library in -- in that narrow context,\nyes, but I do think that that's the -- we're getting down\nto the refinements of particular applications and those\ntypes of challenges have not yet been made.\nQUESTION: General Olson, the words of the\nstatute itself, though -- there is some ambiguity. It's\n-- with regard to disabling the filter, the words are for\nbona fide research or other lawful use. And am I right in\nthinking that your prior answer meant other lawful use\nmeans anything? So, in effect, for an adult anything but\nobscenity would be a lawful use.\nMR. OLSON: I believe that that's -- that's --\nwell, child pornography would also be excluded. Both\nobscenity and child pornography --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: -- there are Federal criminal\nstatutes with respect to both of those. And -- and again,\nthis is a reasonable effort by the library -- by the\nCongress to make rational decisions with respect to\nallowing for some escape for people who are doing research\nor for other appropriate purposes.\nQUESTION: Yes, but -- but how would that\nauthorize the unblocking entirely which would let in not\njust the material that's useful for research, but also\nobscenity, also child pornography? How is that allowing a\n-- a lawful use? That's allowing an unlawful use, isn't\nit?\nMR. OLSON: Well, I -- I agree with that, but --\nQUESTION: So if you agree with it, it means\nthat -- that --\nMR. OLSON: If -- if -- excuse me, Justice\nScalia.\nQUESTION: No. I think if you agree with it, it\n-- it means that you can't unblock a whole channel. You\ncan say, I'll let you have this material, but I can't\nunblock this channel.\nMR. OLSON: The -- the --\nQUESTION:\nthere.\nMR. OLSON: The statute put it in terms of bona\nfide research or other lawful purposes. That -- there's\nbound to be some interpretive -- given the joints there.\nAnd again, to the extent that that would trigger a funding\ndecision with respect to the enforcement authority or\nsomething, that's appropriately raised in an as-applied\nchallenge.\nI think it's important to stress the converse of\nwhat the appellees are asking for here. They're asking\nthis Court to make a judgment that the First Amendment\nprohibits them from exercising the discretion to make that\nkind of choice with respect to the Internet that they've\nalways made or traditionally made with respect to the\nbooks on their shelf.\nThe consequence of that, it seems to me, would\nbe strict scrutiny applicable to librarians' judgments\nwith respect to not just the Internet, but microfilm,\ntelevision, other medium that might -- other media that\nmight come into the library, and that librarians, instead\nof spending money on books, are going to be spending money\non lawyers defending cases brought by authors saying, you\n-- you violated my First Amendment right not to have\nstrict scrutiny, and that instead of librarians making\nthese --\nQUESTION: But, General Olson, Justice White\nwrote a number of opinions in the First Amendment area\nwhere he started out saying, this is a case about\nbillboards, or this is a case about something else. I\nwould think this is a case about the Internet. It's not a\ncase about books.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it might be if the decision\nwas written that way, Justice Stevens, but if -- if the\nappellees are right, the types of decisions that\nlibrarians have been making, appropriateness is -- is the\nword, quality, appropriateness, and appropriate decisions\n-- it's -- it's in the record. Those types of decisions\nthe librarians are saying -- asking this Court to say are\nsubject to strict scrutiny and violate the Constitution.\nThis Court would have to make a First Amendment\ndistinction between the selection of a book and the\nselection of another source of information.\nQUESTION: But isn't there a practical\ndistinction that's got to be taken into consideration in\nyour argument? And that is, not every library can have\nevery book. Something has got to be excluded. So we\nstart with the assumption that the librarians have got to\nmake these judgments. We don't start with that assumption\nin the case of the Internet at all.\nAnd the question in the case of the Internet is\nthe different one. Can you require them to exclude\ncertain materials that it would be illegal for them to\nhave as -- as an abstract matter? Sure, I suppose.\nBut the -- the tough question is, can you\nrequire them necessarily to exclude a great deal more\nabout which they make no decision whatsoever and which\nwould be perfectly legal for them to have?\nMR. OLSON: Justice Scalia -- I mean, Justice\nSouter --\nQUESTION: You do me a great honor. But I --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I am Souter.\nMR. OLSON: I think I was expecting the next\nquestion.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I wasn't even leaning forward.\nMR. OLSON: Nothing is being --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: Nothing is being required of the\nlibrary. The library, if it chooses --\nQUESTION: If -- if they want them. But you're\n-- but you're right, sure.\nMR. OLSON: If it wants to.\nBut the case comes to this Court in the posture\nthat the district court has held and the appellees are\narguing that for the library voluntarily to make that\nchoice on their own, irrespective of any Federal\nGovernment subsidy or anything, would violate the First\nAmendment rights of their patrons.\nQUESTION: General Olson, what does the record\ndisclose is the percentage of lawful material that is\nexcluded under these software programs as opposed to\nmaterial that is unlawful for the library to --\nMR. OLSON: Well, the -- the testimony was\nvaried, Justice O'Connor. One of the -- one of the\nfindings of the district court was that tens of thousands\nof pages of material may be erroneously blocked. Now, the\nproblem with that is that different filters might block\ndifferent things. Sites may be unblocked. The filter may\nbe set aside. But even if it's tens of thousands of the\n-- of the 2 billion pages of material that is on the\nInternet, we're talking about one two-hundredths of 1\npercent, even if it's 100,000, of materials would be\nblocked.\nIf it -- if it please the Court, I would like to\nreserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, General Olson.\nMr. Smith, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe Children's Internet Protection Act is\nunconstitutional for two separate reasons.\nFirst, the act does require libraries accepting\nFederal funds to engage in conduct that is itself at least\npresumptively unconstitutional. Strict scrutiny does\napply, we say, because the --\nQUESTION: What -- what cases are you relying on\nto say that the libraries would be required to engage in\n-- in conduct that is presumptively unconstitutional?\nMR. SMITH: This Court's whole series of cases\ninvolving the public forum doctrine, Your Honor, which I\nnoticed was -- was not really mentioned by my colleague,\nMr. Olson.\nThe Internet, when it comes into the library, is\n-- all of the information available on the Internet, as\ndiverse as human thought -- immediately available to the\npatron. It is the most pure form of public forum that you\ncan possibly imagine.\nQUESTION: Yes, but it begs the question. The\n-- the point is that the Government is saying, if you want\nto get our money, you don't let it all come in. So it is\nnot -- it is not a public forum once -- once the -- once\nthe blocking is applied.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, the whole question\nabout whether the library could do it this way depends on\nhow you view the public forum doctrine. And the -- what\nthe Court has said again and again is in deciding whether\nsomething is or is not a public forum, you look at whether\nthe access is selective or general. That -- that's what\nthe terminology was in the Court's case --\nQUESTION: You're not relying, at any rate, on\ncases dealing with libraries as such.\nMR. SMITH: No. No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: You're relying on a more general --\nMR. SMITH: Applying the Court's general\nholdings in -- in a whole series of cases to try to decide\nwhether this is a public forum, a designated public forum,\ncreated --\nQUESTION: You conclude that -- you conclude\nthat a library is a designated public forum.\nMR. SMITH: The Internet terminals in the\nlibrary are a designated public forum, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Not the whole library?\nMR. SMITH: Certainly not. We do not say that\nstrict scrutiny applies to the decisions that the library\nmakes about which book to buy because when the library\nbuys books, it chooses books one by one. It engages in\nselective access as opposed to general access.\nWith the Internet, on the other hand, the entire\nworld of -- of content that is on the Internet is there\navailable to the patrons. It has not been selected --\nQUESTION: Not --\nMR. SMITH: -- by the library in any way.\nQUESTION: Not necessarily. I mean, a library\nsays -- and some have -- some did this before -- before\nthe Federal statute was in effect. A library says,\nthere's this whole wide world of the Internet out there,\nbut we don't want all of it. Some of it is garbage, and\ntherefore we're going to block the obscenity. We're going\nto block the child pornography, and we're going to block\nthe -- the pornography that's harmful to children. Now,\nonce they've made that decision, hey, presto, it is not a\npublic forum anymore.\nMR. SMITH: That -- that -- with respect,\nJustice Scalia, the way the public forum doctrine works in\nour judgment -- and we're basing this as -- as close as we\ncan on this Court's cases -- is that the one thing that\nGovernment can't do is allow all content under the sun,\nnot even knowing what content is there, and then exclude,\ncull out one area of disfavored content. If -- if you say\nthat that exclusion, that -- that pointing at that one\nparticular area of content and excluding it, is the same\nas not making it a public forum, then -- then the public\nforum doctrine no longer has any meaning.\nQUESTION: Is it also a public forum if it's a\npublic school library?\nMR. SMITH: The -- the case of a public school\nlibrary is a -- is a more difficult case.\nQUESTION: I just want a yes or no answer. On\nyour theory is it or is it not a public forum if it's in a\npublic school library?\nMR. SMITH: I think, Your Honor, I can't give\nyou a yes or no answer.\nQUESTION: Well, I need a yes or no. You either\ndo think it is or you don't think it is.\nMR. SMITH: I would have to know how the\npolicies are of the school --\nQUESTION: No, no. Exactly everything is the\nsame. I just want to know on your theory of the public\nforum doctrine is the 10th grade library or in an\nelementary school or a high school -- they have -- they do\nexactly what the libraries do here. Is it a public forum?\nMR. SMITH: Then I -- then I do say it's a\npublic forum, Your Honor. If they allow students --\nQUESTION: All right. So on your theory of the\ncase --\nMR. SMITH: Yes.\nQUESTION:\nelementary school, Addison Hill Elementary School, has to\nlet the worst possible pornography go over the computers\nthat come into the public school library.\nMR. SMITH: Certainly not, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Because?\nMR. SMITH: Certainly not.\nQUESTION: That's what I want my answer to --\nMR. SMITH: First of all, all that holding that\nit's a public forum does is -- is give you the level of\nscrutiny that applies to the rule. Then you have to look\nat the rule, apply the usual standards of narrow\ntailoring, less restrictive alternatives, compelling\ninterests --\nQUESTION: No. We make all those same arguments\nthat you've just made and say, look, there would be all\nthese other alternatives and all -- all the -- I'm -- I'm\njust -- I'm not putting a -- I'm putting a difficult --\nwhat to me is -- is a difficult problem with your\ndoctrine. And I -- I want to see how it works here.\nMR. SMITH: But I think the Constitution\nanalysis may well come out differently with respect to\nyoung children, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, but I -- I need to know fairly\nspecifically because I don't want if there -- if -- to me\nfrankly if -- if your theory of it means that every public\nschool has to have a computer attachment which bring this\nmaterial into the school, I suppose a lot of schools\nwouldn't have computers at all in their libraries. And --\nand that is worrying me. So I'd appreciate --\nMR. SMITH: Well --\nQUESTION: -- a fairly definite answer on this.\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, I think that -- that,\nfirst of all, classrooms are different from libraries even\nin the school context because a school classroom --\nlibrary -- a computer is obviously not used for\nindependent research. If the -- in the library situation\nin the school, you would have different age groups. You'd\nhave different considerations. You'd have different\npolicies. There's a lot of different things that could be\ndistinguished from this case.\nAnd I think it -- it's important --\nQUESTION: So your answer is that in your\nopinion now you think it probably would be constitutional\nas applied to school libraries but not as to public\nlibraries?\nMR. SMITH: It -- it may well be, Your Honor,\ndepending on the age group, depending on the\ncircumstances, depending on the way the -- the library is\nused by the students.\nQUESTION:\nconscious of the holding of this Court in Denver Area v.\nthe FCC where the Court concluded it might be premature to\napply forum analysis due to changes taking place in the\nlaw, the technology, and the industrial structure related\nto telecommunications? I mean, this too seems to me an\narea for caution, is it not, in importing wholesale public\nforum analysis in the library?\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: I would think Denver Area would have\nsome bearing on that.\nMR. SMITH: Denver Area has a substantial\nbearing and I think it's one of the strongest cases\nsupporting our position. It is true that the Court did\nnot go -- it -- the -- the plurality opinion in -- in the\ncase did not go so far as to say we're going to apply a\npublic forum analysis and strict scrutiny, but -- but\nJustice Breyer's opinion went much -- very close to that\nand said we're going to apply very heightened scrutiny.\nWe're going to look very carefully at this.\nAnd this was a law that is in many ways closely\nanalogous to what's going on here. It was a law that\nsaid, we have a public access station. Anybody from the\noutside world can come in and put whatever programming\nthey want on that station, but we're going to exclude\nindecency, just that one area of content, because we don't\nthink that belongs in the home.\nQUESTION: But the -- the other part -- assuming\nit's some kind of stricter than just reasonable, however\nthat is brought about, the -- I'm very much concerned also\nabout something Justice Kennedy raised. If all that this\nstatute means is that a person who wants access to the\n10,000 deep -- whatever it's called -- what's the -- some\nspecial word. It's -- it's deeply like Star Wars almost.\nIt's some kind of like an extra galaxy that's very hard to\nget to.\nAll right. These 10,000 pages which now were\nblocked -- what he has to do -- that person -- is he goes\nto the desk and says, please unblock it. I want to use --\nI want to do research and this is blocking things that I\nwant. I'm not going to look at material that is\nabsolutely unlawful, such as this very obscene material,\nchild pornography. And then the library is free -- will\nsay, fine.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Now, if all that's necessary, you\nhave to go to the desk, what is the great burden on\nspeech? After all, I grew up in a world where they used\nto keep certain materials in a special place in the\nlibrary and you had to go and ask for them. So?\nMR. SMITH:\ndisabling provision is set up, first of all, is it's\ndesigned to give the library some job to determine whether\nyour purpose is bona fide or not. It says bona fide\nresearch or other lawful purpose. So the first problem is\nyou go to the librarian's supervisor who has the authority\nunder the statute to turn off the filter and you have to\nexplain to them what your purpose is to look at the --\nQUESTION: General Olson said no, you don't have\nto explain.\nMR. SMITH: Well, the -- the statute on the face\nof it says the library is required to inquire into your\npurpose and make a decision about whether it is a bona\nfide research purpose or other lawful purpose for looking\nat the material which has been filtered out by the -- by\nthe filter.\nSo you have a discretion problem of severe\nproportions, I submit. Plus, you have a stigma problem,\nvery much like the one --\nQUESTION: But not if you read other lawful\npurpose to mean everything except the specific categories,\nchild pornography, obscenity.\nMR. SMITH: They will presumably have to have\nsome information about what sites you're interested in\nlooking at in order to determine whether that would be\nlawful or not.\nwell, what's -- what is it you need to get that's being\nblocked? Why are you looking at it? Is it lawful?\nQUESTION: It doesn't say that in the statute.\nAll it says in the statute is that the administrator may\ndisable a technology protection to enable access for a\nlawful purpose. So why couldn't you just sign a piece of\npaper saying I do not want to use this for an unlawful\npurpose? Period. End of the matter. What in the statute\nprevents the library from accepting that?\nMR. SMITH: Well, clearly the library is\nresponsible for determining whether or not you fall within\nthe exception. Even if -- even if they're empowered under\nthe statute -- and I think this is unclear -- just to\naccept your representation without any further\nexplanation, you still have the problem that you're going\nup to the -- to the librarian and saying please turn off\nthe smut filter. I need to get access to some material.\nSo that -- that you're being required to do that. There's\na stigma problem very much like --\nQUESTION: Is there any other problem?\nMR. SMITH: There's a third problem, which is\nyou have -- a lot of times this will only come up in the\nmiddle of your research session. You won't know that\nyou're going to be blocked getting access to the\nRepublican National Committee site or to the site for some\norphanage that is trying to raise money. There's -- since\nthe -- many of the blocks are so irrational, you can't\nanticipate it. So you'll have to stop your session and go\ntalk to a librarian about getting this thing turned off or\ngetting this site unblocked. Somebody will then have to\nlook at the site --\nQUESTION: But in a library, when you're looking\nfor a book, it might not be there, and you might have to\ngo to the librarian and order it or borrow it from another\ninstitution. I don't think that's atypical of what\nhappens in research.\nMR. SMITH: But certainly, Your Honor. But --\nbut our submission is that you shouldn't just willy-nilly\ncompare the Internet in the public library to books and\nhow they're handled by libraries because the Internet is a\npublic forum. It is all of this content that has not been\nprescreened or preselected by the Government which they\nare making available to you --\nQUESTION: But in this context, perhaps we\nshould not import public forum analysis. It creates lots\nof problems --\nMR. SMITH: Well, perhaps --\nQUESTION: -- for instance, in public schools,\nas has already been discussed. So it's -- and there is no\ncase from this Court saying that having an Internet in a\nlibrary creates a public forum. That's what we're here to\ndecide I think.\nMR. SMITH: Indeed, Your Honor. And -- and the\nCourt has repeatedly cautioned that when you're making a\ndecision about whether something is a public forum, you\nhave to look at the particular medium of communication\nthat is at issue, not the broader context.\nSo, for example, when the Court in Cornelius was\nlooking at the Combined Federal Campaign and trying to\ndecide whether that was a public forum, the Government\nsaid, well, it's the Federal work force. The Federal work\nforce is not a public forum. But the Court said, no, we\nhave to look and see what kinds of people have been given\naccess to the Combined Federal Campaign and allowed to\nsolicit funding from the Federal -- the Federal workers\nand has it been done on a selective basis or a general\nbasis. Because it was selective, the Court ultimately\ndetermined that it's not a public forum.\nIt may well be that --\nQUESTION: Well, if you say that the world we\nlook at is the people using these programs under the\nFederal law requirements in libraries, then it isn't a\npublic forum.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, if you allow the\nGovernment to define its forum as all content under sun --\nunder the sun ever invented by mankind except the piece\nthat they don't like, then I submit that -- that will be\nthe end of the public forum doctrine because there will\nnever be any situation in which the Government will be\nconstrained in any way to censor out a particular piece of\ncontent that it -- from the public forum.\nQUESTION: Designated public forum doctrine.\nMR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Traditional public forums will always\nbe public forums.\nMR. SMITH: Right, but I'm -- we're here in the\ncontext of designated public forums. And if you allow\ncontent --\nQUESTION: I've always had trouble with that\ndoctrine anyway.\nMR. SMITH: If -- if you allow the content --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SMITH: -- to be defined as everything but,\nthat's okay. Then there -- there is no doctrine.\nQUESTION: So -- so a -- a library that chooses\nnot to get the Internet at all is not a public forum.\nIt's only when it gets Internet terminals that it becomes\na public forum?\nMR. SMITH: Well, and it -- and then it has to\nmake another decision.\nInternet on or is it going to do what it could do, which\nis to say we are going to treat websites like we treat\nbooks. We're going to look at them one by one and decide\nwhether they should be available, whether they meet our\ncollection development policies.\nQUESTION: But I thought -- you said there are\ntwo reasons why you should prevail, and we're still on the\nfirst.\nMR. SMITH: I appreciate that, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But -- but you -- you said at the --\nat the outset that it would be -- as I understood it, that\nit would be unconstitutional for you to do this on your\nown initiative. And now you're saying that you could?\nMR. SMITH: No, no, no. It would be -- it would\ntrigger strict scrutiny for a library to do exactly what\nthe statute requires. That's our submission, which is to\nsay if they allow the whole Internet in except this one\npiece of content under the public forum doctrine -- or\nperhaps the Court wants to apply the kind of public forum\ndoctrine light of the whole question of whether --\nQUESTION: I just want to be -- I just want to\nbe clear. Suppose this is a general public library.\nMR. SMITH: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION:\nthe statute tells it it must do?\nMR. SMITH: Our position is that that would\ntrigger strict scrutiny that they would then have to\nsatisfy and --\nQUESTION: Well, and how would the strict\nscrutiny come out?\nMR. SMITH: Excuse me? Well, in -- in most, if\nnot all, cases it would come out against it. It would be\nunconstitutional, clearly, because they're blocking a vast\namount of speech that is not even sexually explicit. And\nso we have a narrow tailoring problem. And there are much\nmore -- much more effective, less restrictive alternatives\nwhich we had all this evidence at trial about.\nQUESTION: And that -- and that is -- and that\nis because legally you would be a state entity denying\naccess to a designated forum to a -- a listener who is a\nmember of the public.\nMR. SMITH: Exactly, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: What was your --\nQUESTION: What if the -- what if the facts were\nchanged in this way? The library -- I'm sorry. Did I --\nno. Please go ahead.\nQUESTION: No. I think we're still pursuing the\nfirst --\nMR. SMITH: Yes. I'm trying to make sure I get\nthe --\nQUESTION: Sooner or later, I want you to get to\nthe second --\nMR. SMITH: I appreciate it, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Okay. One last question before you\nget to the second one.\nWhat if the library said, we're not letting in\nthe whole Internet? We think there are some sites that it\nwould be valuable for our research patrons to have. We're\ngoing to -- we're simply going to select 100 websites or\n1,000 out of the millions that are there and we're going\nto let them in. Would that be a violation of designated\npublic forum?\nMR. SMITH: Clearly not, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. SMITH: There's no -- there's no argument\nthat we -- we'd make that that would be unconstitutional.\nThey would then be letting them in as they would books,\nusing their collection development policies, deciding\nwhat's valuable, and that would not be a violation.\nQUESTION: But -- but how did -- I mean, it's\nfine to say it's no violation of the Constitution. But\nyou're also saying yet it remains a designated public\nforum.\nMR. SMITH: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Oh, it -- you agree it would not be a\ndesignated public forum.\nMR. SMITH: Absolutely not. If they're not\nletting everybody in, as -- as general access. They're\nexercising selective access.\nQUESTION: But don't -- don't many libraries\nalready exclude, for example, chat rooms?\nMR. SMITH: It's not a question of exclusion.\nIt's a question of affirmative inclusion through\nselection --\nQUESTION: No, no. I mean, but -- but my\nunderstanding was that some libraries that -- that have\naccess to the Web do not allow access to chat rooms. They\ndon't think that that's a proper library -- library\nfunction or whatever. At least as to those libraries, I\nassume you would acknowledge that there's no designated\npublic forum.\nMR. SMITH: No, Your Honor. We don't\nacknowledge that excluding --\nQUESTION: I didn't think you would.\nMR. SMITH: -- excluding an area of content can\ntake it out of the forum doctrine.\nLet me get to my second point, though, which --\nwhich is --\nQUESTION: When you start on your second point,\nlet me just ask you to comment on one thing because I want\nto be -- I want the Solicitor General also to comment on\nthe same thing. Do you think, given the state of the\nrecord now, if we agreed with the Government's submission\nthat the district court's rationale was wrong, would it be\nproper for us to decide to rule on the second theory?\nMR. SMITH: Oh, clearly, Your Honor. I don't\nthink there are any -- any facts that it would be\nnecessary for the Court that haven't been brought out in\nthat -- that trial and that lengthy opinion.\nNow, our position with respect to point two\nis --\nQUESTION: What is point two?\nMR. SMITH: It is that libraries --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SMITH: -- even -- even if the Internet is\nprecisely analogous to books in the library context, that\nsomething about the library context lets librarians in the\nexercise of professional judgment that they ordinarily\nexercise, even in deciding to edit the Internet, that the\nFederal Government under the First Amendment has no\nbusiness using the spending power to try to distort that\nmedium and push librarians away from their professional\njudgment toward the most restrictive possible policy on\ninformation flow into the library setting.\nIn other words, our second point is that a\nlibrary is very much like a public university which this\nCourt has several times indicated is a -- is a special\nsphere set off for the governmental promotion of private\nand free expression, that in that kind of a setting, the\nFederal Government should not use the spending power to\nimpose a one-size-fits-all policy about --\nQUESTION: Is this a federalism concept and you\n-- and you would cite our cases like Printz and so forth?\nMR. SMITH: No, Your Honor. I'm citing only\nFirst Amendment cases. I believe it is a First Amendment\nconcept that there are certain kinds of relationships or\ncertain kinds of institutions in which the amount of\nspeech that is being allowed is decided by the people who\nare designated as professionals to run that institution.\nFor example --\nQUESTION: So -- so your argument would be the\nsame if the -- if the State of California were doing it.\nIt's not just the Federal Government.\nMR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor.\nIf it was done by statute. But -- but, for\nexample, professors should set the curriculum at a public\nuniversity.\nthe universities of this country, we've given you money,\nyou therefore have to cut your departments. If you -- if\nyou take the money --\nQUESTION: How about -- can the board of regents\nset the curriculum?\nMR. SMITH: I think it -- when you get to the\npeople who run the -- run the university as their job,\nthat's fine, yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I mean, that's pretty far-reaching.\nIt's very interesting. But the -- the question -- I'm --\nI don't suppose you object to the Federal Government\nsaying, even if it's money to be spent on books, you\ncannot spend this money for material that it is unlawful\nfor the student to see, such as child pornography. Are\nyou objecting to that? Suppose the Federal Government\nwere to say, no child pornography.\nMR. SMITH: Certainly not, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Certainly not, okay. So then what\nyou're objecting to is we let them cut that stuff out, but\nyou're objecting to the requirement of a particular\ntechnology where the technology may exclude some other\nthings.\nMR. SMITH: Well --\nQUESTION: That's your objection.\nMR. SMITH:\nbook question. What this law is analogous to is, as\napplied to the book context, a law where the Government\nsays we're going to help you buy books. Here's 10 percent\nof your book budget a year, and it doesn't just say you\ncan't spend our money on books of a particular content.\nIt says you can't have in your library books of a\nparticular content. It starts to try to invade the\nprofessional judgments of librarians about what books\nwould need to be to their patrons.\nAnd we have here a situation where 93 percent of\nthe libraries have made a more liberal, more open policy\ndecision than the one that the Congress favors, and\nthey're now using the spending power to push them in --\nQUESTION: Well, what if -- what if the Federal\nGovernment said, we're going to give you 10 percent of\nyour annual appropriation and you can't use that money to\nacquire a particular class of books?\nMR. SMITH: I think as long as it was viewpoint\nneutral, Your Honor, and otherwise a legitimate line, that\nwould be not a problem. But -- but here --\nQUESTION: Well, supposing you -- you can't use\nit to acquire soft pornography.\nMR. SMITH: To the extent one could define that\nconcept, I think that generally the Government -- the\nCourt has said the Government can decide what -- what the\nmoney that it uses to subsidize the -- the local\ngovernment with -- what it will be spent on, but it can't,\nI think, then expand the subsidy into attempting to\nregulate things like the other book decisions that the\nlibrary might make.\nQUESTION: Well, even in areas where it's\nalready against the law to have materials that are obscene\nor harmful to minors? You think the Government has no\nauthority to prohibit its aid to be used for that?\nMR. SMITH: Of course not, Your Honor.\nCertainly the Government can say that you shouldn't make\navailable materials to people that -- that -- for whom\nthey have no constitutional right to see them, obscenity\nfor adults --\nQUESTION: Right. Now, should we make any\nallowance here? Is there any leeway, if you will, simply\nbecause the technology is not yet available to filter\nperfectly where it's evident that there isn't a huge\npercentage amount of things that are being excluded, but\nthe software isn't perfect?\nMR. SMITH: Well --\nQUESTION: Should -- should our doctrine take\nthat into account, do you suppose?\nMR. SMITH: If -- if I might, just in answer to\nthat question, Your Honor, take a moment to describe what\n-- what it really is that the record shows about how these\nfilters operate because I -- I think that that's really\nvery helpful.\nWhat these -- these filters are, are lists of --\nof sites that are banned for access in the -- in the\nsetting where they're -- where they're in effect, and the\n-- the findings are that there's about 100,000 sexually\nexplicit sites on the Internet at the time of trial. And\nso we can assume that some high percentage of that 100,000\nare on the list, 90,000 perhaps, because there were some\nthat they missed constantly.\nNow, in addition, the court found that the --\nthe very same list blocks at least tens of thousands of\nadditional sites that are not sexually explicit at all or,\nif they have sexually explicit materials, are educational.\nThey -- they teach people about gay sexuality or they\nteach them about safe sex techniques. And so we have --\non these lists is a proportion, a huge proportion, perhaps\n25, perhaps 50 percent of the sites that are blocked that\nare not illegal even for children.\nNow, of the 90,000 or so that are blocked that\nare sexually explicit, there isn't a shred of evidence in\nthis trial record that the Government attempted to put in\nabout whether any of those are obscene. There was no\nshowing of any kind that the filters ever actually find\nspeech that is illegal for adults. And there's good\nreason to think that there isn't a lot of it on there\nbecause clearly illegal material is distributed in a\ndifferent way than the -- than the way that would allow\nthe filtering --\nQUESTION: Mr. Smith, you used -- you said\nperhaps 50 percent. This -- and General Olson said tens\nof thousands of pages, but consider the --\nMR. SMITH: Well --\nQUESTION: -- in relation to the Internet.\nIn this record, at least in this opinion, this\nwas the finding made more often than any other by that\nthree-judge court, but every time they used the word\nsubstantial -- and they don't give us any 50 percent.\nSubstantial over-blocking is the word that's come up over\nand over again. I think you must have said it in at least\na dozen findings.\nMR. SMITH: If I could -- if I could address\nthat, Your Honor. The -- the court did say at least tens\nof thousands and they used the word pages at that point.\nBut it's quite evident, if you look at the way they were\nreasoning from the evidence, that they meant sites. And\nthe evidence is that there's about 11 million websites on\nthe Internet, in -- in the accessible part of the Internet\nand that 100,000 of those are the sexually explicit ones\nand that the -- there are at least tens of thousands more\nthat are on the list.\nSo it's -- the Government also says in their\nbrief that about one percent of the Internet is over-\nblocked, which would be about 100,000 sites.\nSo it is a substantial percentage. It is also a\nsubstantial amount. And most importantly, it's a very\nlarge percentage of what they're blocking is not what they\nintend to block.\nQUESTION: Mr. Smith --\nQUESTION: Oh, you mean the Government --\nQUESTION: -- can I ask you a question about --\nabout the public forum doctrine? As I understood your\nearlier answer, the Internet is not a public forum if a\nlibrary does not take all of it and chooses to exclude\nchat boxes.\nMR. SMITH: No, that is not my answer.\nQUESTION: Oh, that isn't your answer.\nMR. SMITH: No. Our answer is --\nQUESTION: It -- it remains a designated public\nforum even if you don't take all of it, you say. Chat\nrooms. We don't want them.\nMR. SMITH: The way for it not to be a public\nforum is for them to decide affirmatively what they do\nwant to include, not simply to say we'll take the -- the\ncontent of 400 million people contributing to the\nInternet, but we'll carve out one thing. If you allow\nthat, then there is no designated public forum doctrine,\nand the Court has repeatedly said the distinction between\na public forum and not is whether or not there's been\nselective access, which -- by which it means case by\ncase --\nQUESTION: Why isn't that selective access? I\n-- we don't want chat rooms. And it's not a total free-\nfor-all, anybody wants to come in and talk. No, we don't\nwant chat rooms.\nMR. SMITH: Maybe chat rooms are okay because\nthe question is whether that's a content-based exclusion.\nBut clearly, here you have a content-based exclusion.\nQUESTION: It isn't content-based. No. Okay.\nIt's not a content-based --\nMR. SMITH: And it --\nQUESTION: Now, so if they say no chat rooms, it\ndoesn't become a designated public forum.\nWhy does it remain a designated public forum if\nwhat they say is, in addition to chat rooms, we don't want\nthat portion of the Internet that runs a risk of bringing\ninto our computers obscenity, child pornography, material\nharmful to children? We don't -- I don't really know what\nit is but it's not worth it to us.\nrooms and we don't want this -- you say it's over-\ninclusive. It's not over-inclusive. It's whatever it\ntakes to keep out of what we're bringing into our library\nthose harmful materials. Now, why does that mean I've\ncreated a public forum?\nMR. SMITH: The fact that they may -- may or may\nnot think they have a good reason for doing it can't\nfactor into the analysis, Your Honor. The way the -- the\npublic forum doctrine works is you look at whether or not\nthey -- they have allowed access generally or not, and if\nthey have allowed access generally and then they say, but\nwe don't want this, then that's a violation or at least it\ntriggers strict scrutiny.\nQUESTION: And that would also be a violation if\nthe Government paid for 100 percent of the cost of the\ncomputer, both the hardware and the monthly billing for\nthe Internet.\nMR. SMITH: Yes, because it lets in everything\nin the world. Every commercial site, every catalog,\neverybody's personal website, and a million other things I\ncan't even conjure up are all being allowed in and\nprovided to people in that setting. And then they're\nsaying, except you can't have this.\nNow, if that's permitted under the forum\ndoctrine, how can Southeastern Promotions be right where\nthey said you can have any -- any play except Hair? We\ndon't like Hair.\nQUESTION: Well, you can have it. You just have\nto go up to the desk and ask for it.\nMR. SMITH: And you have to deal with exactly\nthe -- the discretion of -- of the librarian and about\nwhether or not he or she is going to allow you -- allow\nit. You have to deal with the stigma, and you have to\ntake the time out from your research session to go do that\nif it turns out in the middle of your research session\nthat -- that some site that you need to go to. And you\nhave to decide to do it not seeing the site because you\ncan't see it to know whether it's valuable to you. So\nwhen you're surfing the Internet, the vastly more likely\noutcome will be that anything that's blocked people will\njust bypass and go on to something else.\nQUESTION: What would your response be if -- if\nyou start where Mr. Olson started and said, you don't have\nto go through all of this? All you have to do is walk up\nto the librarian and say, I'm an adult. I want it\nunblocked. And it will be unblocked. Where -- where does\nthat leave your position?\nMR. SMITH: Well, it's not clear that the\nlibrarian would say yes. The librarian certainly doesn't\nhave to say yes.\nQUESTION: I -- I think Mr. Olson's suggestion\nwas that the librarian, absent some extraneous reason,\nwould say yes. So -- so let's add that to the mix. The\nlibrarian says yes, unblock. What is -- where's your\nposition?\nMR. SMITH: It seems he's on a horn -- the horns\nof a dilemma. Either that is something that has got a lot\nof stigma to it that very few people are going to do, so\nit has the -- the effect of suppressing speech, or\neverybody --\nQUESTION: Is that your position --\nMR. SMITH: That is my position.\nQUESTION: -- that even to do that would be\nstigma?\nMR. SMITH: Yes.\nQUESTION: So that doesn't solve the problem.\nMR. SMITH: Sure. You've got to go up and say\nplease turn off the porn filter, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: That isn't what he says.\nMR. SMITH: Well, that's what it is.\nQUESTION: He says, look, you block a lot of\nstuff. Just please unblock it.\nMR. SMITH: Well, if it turns out that people\nwouldn't be stigmatized by that -- and I think the court\nbelow was correct to conclude that they will be -- then --\nthen there's the second problem, which is what -- what is\nthe purpose that you've accomplished by requiring people\nto go through this meaningless exercise other than to\ndeter them. That is apparently then the only purpose of\nit and --\nQUESTION: Well, it distinguishes an adult from\na child.\nMR. SMITH: You can do that in many different\nways, Your Honor, that don't require anybody to approach\nanybody. You simply have a -- a card that they put in the\ncomputer that shows their age, and then it gives them\nwhatever access the library decides is appropriate or\nwhatever the parents may have decided is appropriate for\nthe children. There are many less restrictive\nalternatives including use of the filtering technology as\nan option, at the parents' option for different ages that\n-- that can be considered and which were explored in depth\nby the district court, which I must say looked at this\nissue very carefully, was very sympathetic to the problems\nthat arise with the -- with the sexually explicit content.\nIt said the one thing we can't do is have one\nacross-the-board answer even in one library, especially\nnationally, to have Congress which has no knowledge at all\nabout what conditions may prevail in any given library,\nsaying, well, we're going to push you, through the\nbudgetary process, toward our position even though 93\npercent of the librarians have found a much more suitable\nset of solutions in less restrictive, somewhat more\nsubtle, more mixed policies than the one that Congress\ndecided in its wisdom it should try to force on the\nlibrary community using the spending power.\nQUESTION: Mr. Smith, this -- this law covers\nelementary and secondary schools as well, but this\nchallenge relates only to libraries.\nMR. SMITH: Only to public libraries, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Smith.\nGeneral Olson, you have 5 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: I would like to invite the Court's\nattention to page 37a of the appendix to the\njurisdictional statement which is the decision of the\ncourt below. In the first full paragraph, the court found\napproximately 95 percent of libraries with public Internet\naccess have some form of acceptable use policy or Internet\nuse policy governing patrons' use of the Internet.\nNow, what the libraries are saying here is the\nexercise of certain discretion violates the First\nAmendment rights of their patrons, and therefore every\ntime they exercise that type of discretion in this\ncontext, they're subject to strict scrutiny.\nWhat this statute does is gives the libraries\nthe right, if they choose to accept Federal funds, to make\nwhat kind of decisions, to exclude pornography which\nthere's no dispute in the record libraries have, from time\nimmemorial, chosen not to put in their libraries. So the\ndecision that they're making is the same one they have\nalready voluntarily made over the years.\nIt would inhibit their decisions to exclude\ne-mail, chat, gambling, dating services, and the other\nthings that this part of the court below's decision held\nthat they are doing already. It's the traditional type of\ndiscretion that libraries have exercised with respect to\nwhether they be -- want to be a fiction library or a\nlibrary that's specializing in this or that or technology\nor anything along those lines. So the type of discretion\nthat the librarians are saying violate their First\nAmendment rights are the types of discretion precisely\nthat they've been exercising for years.\nQUESTION: General Olson, I hate to use part of\nyour rebuttal time. But would you tell me whether the\nGovernment thinks we should address the unconstitutional\nconditions issue that's discussed at length in the\nfootnote if we agree with you on your principal\nsubmission?\nMR. OLSON: I -- we have no problem if the Court\ndecides it, although it wasn't briefed and it wasn't the\ndecision below, but we don't think it's remotely possible\nfor this Court to decide that question in this context\nagainst the Government. If -- if the libraries are right,\nthey're saying they don't have a First -- they can't have\nit both ways. They don't have a First Amendment right to\nmake this discretion -- discretionary decision with\nrespect to their -- the -- the materials in their library,\nand then they turn around and say, allowing us to make\nthat is an unconstitutional -- or giving us an incentive\nto make that very decision is an unconstitutional\ncondition.\nThis is a condition that's connected with\nlibraries' traditional decisions. It's in an area where\nthe Government -- the Congress of the United States and\nthis Court has said the Government has a compelling\ngovernmental interest already. It's a condition to the\nuse of the funds. This is not extracting from libraries\nsome separate, unconnected decision. It's connected with\nthe actual use of the funds.\nAnd it does not say that libraries may not stock\npornography. If they want to abandon the years of\ntradition of not stocking pornography on their bookshelves\nor in some other form, movies, whatever it might be, they\ncan still do that without violating this condition.\nSo the libraries have plenty of choices. They\ncan not accept the public money. They can accept the\npublic money and use it in -- in the way that Congress\ndecided, which is consistent with their traditional\nexercise of discretion.\nThere's many distinguishing factors between this\ncase and the cases in -- in which the Court has exercised\n-- expressed some concern with respect to the First\nAmendment issues here. It is not -- this case is not a\nregulation of speech, but the actions of a Government\nacting in a proprietary capacity -- a library to make its\nown decisions, deciding what to subsidize, what speech to\nhave in that library, what speech not to have in that\nlibrary.\nThe Government is merely -- is making a content\ndecision, not a viewpoint decision. There's no contention\nthat there's a viewpoint decision. The type of decision\nthat they say is being forced upon them, which is actually\nvoluntary, is the same type of decision that libraries --\nlibrarians customarily make.\nThe Federal statute and the library policy that\nthey're complaining about expands information, it doesn't\ncontract information.\nEducational Television case, a jurisprudence that would\nresult in the constriction of speech, rather than the\nexpansion of speech, would be a repression of First\nAmendment rights.\nIf Congress can't put this condition --\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Olson.\nMR. OLSON: Thank you.\n"
