        "content": "(10:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in Case 06-989, Hall Street Associates v.\nMattel, Inc.\nMr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn this case two very sophisticated parties\nagreed to arbitrate an ongoing dispute that was pending\nin litigation before the United States District Court\nfor the District of Oregon. Their agreement states\nplainly that after an arbitration award is issued the\ndistrict court -- and this is at Pet. App. 16A -- \"shall\nvacate, modify, or correct any award where the\narbitrator's conclusions of law are erroneous.\"\nUltimately what this Court must decide is whether there\nis anything in either the Federal Arbitration Act or any\nother Federal law that renders this non-adhesive,\nunambiguous contract agreement unenforceable.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, would you\nsay the same thing if the agreement provided for de novo\nreview in the district court?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I would be more concerned\nabout identifying a standard of review for the district\ncourt than identifying a standard for modifying the\narbitration award pursuant to the agreement. So I think\nthat's a different issue. I think that's closer to\ndealing with a judicial function than this is, which is\nsimply implementing the intent of the parties as to what\nthe standard ought to be for enforcing an initial award.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That would be -- I am\nassuming that the parties wrote that standard into their\ncontract, so to the extent you're relying on party\nautonomy why couldn't the parties elect whatever\nstandard of review they wish?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, I recognize\nthat there is a limit to party autonomy. I think there\nought to be a very strong preference for party autonomy,\nand I'm not saying that if I were here and I had an\nagreement by which de novo review is the standard I\nwouldn't defend that autonomy. All I'm saying is that I\nrecognize that there are limitations on autonomy that\nrecognize the functions of the Judiciary. But that\nlimitation isn't remotely implicated in this particular\ncase.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in some -- one of\nthe functions of a judicial -- what about an agreement,\narbitration agreement, that the district court can find\nfacts de novo?\nMR. PHILLIPS: That one I think worries me\nless because it doesn't -- it doesn't suggest -- I mean\nit just says that we will leave to the district, to the\ndistrict court the findings, and essentially renders the\narbitration agreement --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose it's a\ncomplex matter of monitoring emissions, looking at water\nquality, and the arbitrator has to sit by the river for\na month, the district judge had to go down and sit by\nthe river for a month.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But again, the parties under\nthose circumstances it seems to me are perfectly free to\ndecide whether they want those issues to be decided\nconclusively by the arbitrator or to have them\nadjudicated at the end of the day by the Federal court.\nAnd so, if they choose to go through the arbitral\nprocess, and then still say nevertheless that's\nnonbinding and that the district court's free to\nevaluate that on a de novo record, that it seems to me\ndoesn't in fact implicate the judicial function in quite\nthe same way that the standard of review does.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed, are there not such\nthings as nonbinding arbitration's?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Precisely, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which in effect say that\nwhen we're done the district court will do it as an\noriginal matter.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. And in that context\nyou're not raising the same problem that you're\nreferring to, Justice Ginsburg, because you're not\nsaying anything about the standard of review. You're\njust simply saying that the court ought to decide the\nlegal issues.\nNow, I do think that when the parties agree\nthat it's a question of law that the question of law is\nfor the district court to decide. My assumption is that\nthe district court in fact will use de novo review, but\nthe parties are not dictating that. That's a matter\nthat's left -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't the arbitration\nagreement in this case set out a standard of review and\nsay on findings of fact they have to be supported by\nsubstantial evidence?\nMR. PHILLIPS: They do, but that issue --\nthat standard of review is not at issue in this\nparticular case. The only question here is whether or\nnot there has been an error of law committed, and\nobviously the district court found that there was a\nclear error of law committed. Indeed, the dissenting\njudge below said it was an irrational decision on the\nlaw.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Phillips --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they were both --\nthey were both in this agreement, both the substantial\nevidence rule and the standard of review of legal error.\nSo are you saying that you -- we don't have to deal with\nthat question or you're not going to defend it, because\nthe standard was dual. Am I not right about what they\n--\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. There are, there are\nclearly two different standards that are set out in the\narbitration agreement and one of them is substantial\nevidence. But when the matter went from the arbitrator\nto the district court there was no issue presented by\nHall Street on the question of substantial evidence. We\ndidn't challenge any of the factual findings by the --\nby the arbitrator, and therefore that issue is not\npresented. I'm not saying I wouldn't defend it. All\nI'm saying is I don't have to defend it in this\nparticular case because the only issue here is whether\nthere has been an error of law.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you have to give us a\nstandard. You said, you mentioned, oh, functions of the\ndistrict court. I don't know the standard you're\nproposing that will allow us to draw the line and to put\ncases on one side of the line or the other. You said,\nwell, you can't interfere with the functions of the\ncourt. I don't quite understand that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the problem there --\nand again, I think this is largely a fanciful concern\nbecause I don't think serious parties who are engaged in\narbitration agreements are likely to come up with\nstandards that are completely alien to the judicial\nprocess, and indeed there's no empirical evidence to\nsupport that. Certainly Respondent didn't cite anything\nand our amici didn't cite anything like that.\nBut to be sure, Judge Kozinski in his\nconcurring opinion in the original panel decision in\nKyocera said he would have a very different reaction to\nthis case if we were talking about the district court\neither flipping a coin or looking at the entrails of\ndead birds as the basis for decision. And our basic\npoint is we're not embracing that extreme approach. I\nmean, we recognize party autonomy as a significant part\nof what Section 2 of the Arbitration Act is all about\nand we think that ought to drive the analysis of this\nCourt significantly, particularly in how you interpret\nSection 9.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Phillips, why do\nyou care? If this is not enforceable under the Federal\nArbitration Act, which gives you kind of a shortcut --\nthe district court must confirm it if certain criteria\nare met -- I assume you have a normally enforceable\ncontract that the district court can enforce just like\nit enforces any other contract.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's absolutely true,\nparticularly in this context, Mr. Chief Justice, because\nhere we have a situation where we were before the\ndistrict court, this arrangement came out of the\nmediation process, the district court reviewed it,\nblessed it, sent it to the arbitrator --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you should lose.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- and it came right back.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you should lose.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, no, I should win.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. We should\nconclude that you don't fall within the Federal\nArbitration Act and it's not a big deal because you can\nbring -- you can have the contract enforced. The\ndistrict court as far as I can tell wants to enforce\nthis agreement, presumably will enforce it as a\ncontract. So you don't need the Federal Arbitration\nAct, so why should we fly in the face of its plain\nlanguage to accommodate your interests?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because the problem here is\nnot what happens in the instance if, Section 9 not\napplying, that we're suddenly -- we go back to square\none and start over. That might be true in a different\ncase, but in this particular case we started in Federal\ndistrict court. We brought this action as a -- as a\ncontract action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there a basis --\nwell, the Federal Arbitration Act doesn't provide\njurisdiction anyway. So I assume you have a basis for\nbeing in Federal court --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Diversity, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in the first\nplace. So you're just enforcing a contract in diversity\nin Federal court.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, and that's exactly\nwhat we would ask this Court to be doing here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, you're asking us\nto bring it under the Federal Arbitration Act and say\nthat the district court must confirm it despite the fact\nthat you've changed the standards under Section 9 to 11.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, Mr. Chief Justice, you've\nflipped it around. Remember, we lost in the\narbitration. We won in the district court. The\ndistrict court was prepared to enforce the agreement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Both the underlying lease\nagreement and the arbitration agreement. It was the\ncourt of appeals that said no, you can't do that, you\ncan't enter a final judgment in this case, and the\nreason is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But my point --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- because of the Federal\nArbitration Act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My point is that if\nyou have an ordinary contract action the district court\nwill, because your contract provides a particular\nstandard of review, enforce that. Right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. No, that's absolutely\ntrue. But that's exactly what we're asking you to do\nhere.\nJUSTICE BREYER: On that point -- the reason\nI think you're -- there's a little chaos here is because\nyou said -- your question is phrased, does the FAA\npreclude enforcement of your arbitration agreement? And\nyou're going to say: We answer that question, no, it\ndoesn't preclude it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't require it; it\ndoesn't preclude it.\nBut then would we have to go back and say\nwhat is the source? There has to be some source of law\nthat authorizes this contractual agreement, and there\ncould be two possible sources. And my question here is,\nis it clear that in fact either of these two sources\ndoes?\nThe first source is State law. I gather the\ndifficulty is that the State of Oregon has an act just\nlike the Federal Arbitration Act, so we'd have to ask\nthe Oregon courts: Is this a legitimate contract under\nOregon State law.\nThe alternative source of law is the Federal\njudge's case management authority. And there we have a\nstatute which clearly gives the judge some kind of\nauthority, but not for your case because your case\nexceeds the jurisdictional amount. Therefore, in the\nabsence of that statute, is there inherent authority in\nthe district judge?\nNow, I don't know the answer to either of\nthose questions.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I thought that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: My temptation is to say\nthey're open questions and they'd have to be argued on\nremand, which makes this case the case of the century, I\nguess, in a certain respect. It's quite a difficult\ncase.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I was just looking for the\ncase of the day, Your Honor, actually.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, in a\ncertain area. I overstate.\nBut the -- is there any light you can shed\non those two questions, or is there some third possible\nsource of law?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, we know that -- I think\nthe answer to that is that Section 2 of the Federal\nArbitration Act, which this Court has recognized\nrepeatedly has a very strong preference for enforcing\nthe agreement of the parties, is a part of the answer to\nthat. And you couple that with the fact that Justice\nStory, back as early as 1814, said that as a matter of\ncommon law that the notion of restricted arbitration is\na matter completely left to the parties.\nSo I think that there are general common law\nstandards. Now, you know, could Oregon law have gone\nthe other way on that? Maybe. I think it would be an\ninteresting preemption question. But the Respondent has\nnever argued that this is unenforceable as a matter of\nOregon law. So I don't think that issue is in this\ncase.\nAs a matter of case management, if the Court\nwants to defer to anything then it ought to refer to the\ndistrict court's own assessment that this agreement\nshould be utterly enforceable, that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have you ever argued that\nthis is a matter governed by Oregon law and it is\nenforceable?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. They never --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have you ever argued that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: That it is enforceable?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, under Oregon law.\nHave you ever argued Oregon law?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, we've never argued --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No?\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- Oregon law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then it's not\nsurprising they haven't argued that Oregon law doesn't\napply.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, no.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they have in\nfact. On page 43 of their brief, they say that if you\nprevail the parties would be left to a State law\ncontract action to determine the enforceability of the\naward.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but the State law\ncontract action that they're talking about is precisely\nthe State law contract action we brought in this case\nbefore the Federal district court under diversity\njurisdiction. And at the end of the day what we're\nasking for is for the Court to enforce --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- the district judge's\ndetermination --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. Their citation\nis to an arbitration treatise. The contract they're\nreferring to is the contract to arbitrate. And, unless\nI'm mistaken, what you want is for the district court to\nbe able to enforce your agreement under the Federal\nArbitration Act. Right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because it falls squarely\nwithin the Federal Arbitration Act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it doesn't\nfall squarely within it because the Federal Arbitration\nAct sets different standards of review. And all I'm\nsaying is I don't see what the big deal is because you\n-- okay, don't use the Federal Arbitration Act, which\ngives you kind of an express remedy the district court\nmust confirm. Use normal contract law and say to the\ndistrict court: Well, you don't have the Federal\nArbitration Act, you don't have to confirm it as a\njudgment, but we have a contract, it's perfectly valid,\nit sets a different standard of review, you should\nenforce it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. But I think the\nanswer to that is that if Congress had a choice as\nbetween those alternatives, Congress clearly in Section\n9 made it absolutely indisputable that there's a simple\nway to enforce it, but it didn't suggest the\nalternative, which is that you relegate it to some kind\nof State law, completely complicated process to try and\nget this arbitration award enforced under those\ncircumstances.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I'm just not\nfollowing this discussion. Does it assume that you can\nbring an action on the contract and just bypass the\nprovision of the contract which says there will be\narbitration? How can you do that? You -- you don't\nassert you can do that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, we clearly can't do that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You clearly can't do that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So somebody has to decide\non this arbitration provision.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. And I think the\nCourt, this Court is the court that's got to decide that\nat this point and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The arbitration\nprovision, the arbitration agreement is just a contract.\nRight?\nMR. PHILLIPS: To be sure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then I don't\nunderstand why it's not enforceable as a contract.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't think we disagree on\nthat, Mr. Chief Justice. I think the -- I think that's\nenforceable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if it's\nenforceable -- I'm obviously missing something here. If\nit's enforceable as a contract, what is the great\nbenefit you get out of prevailing and saying this should\nbe enforced under the Federal Arbitration Act?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the benefit is the\nefficiency that the Federal Arbitration Act is trying to\npromote. I mean, to be sure, there -- there could\npotentially be any number of routes you might want to\nidentify. The clearest one is where the parties don't\ncare about what happens on the back end, where they say,\nonce you get your -- you have your -- you get your\narbitration award and then you go off and you do Section\n9 and we don't have any agreement on that. And that one\nis easy, and that's the most efficient.\nThen the question is what do you do in a\nsituation where the parties don't agree with that, where\nthey want the district court to review it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do if\nyou have a contract, an arbitration agreement that's not\ncovered by Section 2, it's not concerning a maritime\ntransaction or involving commerce?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Those are regulated by State\nlaw.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Purely by State law. But\nthis is the contract that falls within Section 2, Mr.\nChief Justice.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But this -- but this one\nisn't, and if we say that you lose under the Federal\nArbitration Act, is it open to the State court to say,\nwell, that's what the Federal Arbitration Act says, but\nwe handle arbitration differently?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, that's sort of the core\nquestion I think that sort of comes out of Southland\nand --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think if you lose on the\narbitration here, you've got to lose on the arbitration\nbefore State court.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean, I think that's what\nSouthland --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean you don't have to\nadmit that. That's --\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's the logic of\nSouthland, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why in the -- why is\nthat the case? I mean, this doesn't purport to occupy\nthe field of arbitration and to preempt State law. It\nprovides that a very direct order -- the district court\nmust confirm the arbitration award as a judgment --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- if you fall\nwithin the criteria. And all I'm saying is they'll say,\nokay, I don't have to confirm it as a judgment.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But I think the answer to the\nconundrum you've raised, Mr. Chief Justice, is that if\nyou're not in Section 9, then you ought to be in Section\n2, and there you should do precisely what the contract\nsays, which is that you should vacate or set aside the\narbitration agreement --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no. You're in\nSection 2, I agree --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- unless -- if there's an\nerror in law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I agree that you're\nin Section 2, and the State court can't invalidate your\nagreement under some special rule that applies only to\narbitration. But you want to be under Section 9, and\nthat says --\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that the district\ncourt must confirm the arbitration award if it meets\ncertain standards.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't need Section 9.\nAll I need is Section 2 because if -- because under our\nagreement, what we specifically say is that the district\ncourt shall vacate, modify, or correct. We're looking\nfor them to correct this award by saying that the right\ninterpretation of this lease is that this is an\napplicable environmental law, and therefore the\nindemnification extends and we are protected.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the only basis\n--\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's what I want under\nSection 2.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The only basis you\nhave for getting them to correct the award is a\ndifferent standard of review than the one provided in\nSection 10.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's true, but that's -- it\nseems to me that just makes my point, which is I don't\nneed Section 9, Your Honor. All I need -- all I need is\nan aggressive, not even aggressive -- a fair\ninterpretation of Section 2 that says that the parties'\nintent controls under these circumstances.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's not that you don't\nneed Section 9. You want to get rid of Section 9 --\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's quite true.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- because Section 9 on its\nface seems to provide the opposite to what you're\nasking. Isn't that the problem?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't know that\nthat's the problem. You're right, I don't want Section\n9 to be controlling here, but I don't think it's meant\nto be controlling under these circumstances. I think\nwhat -- I mean they're making the Section 9 argument.\nAll I'm saying is that there's not a problem created by\nSection 9.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't -- I mean the\nargument that it is meant to be controlling is an\nargument, first, for the plain language.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Pardon me?\nMR. PHILLIPS: When you say \"it's meant to\nbe controlling,\" I don't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Section 9.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Section 9. I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Number one, the plain\nlanguage of the statute.\nNumber two, an argument that that plain\nlanguage, as a matter of historical fact, was\ndeliberately chosen when Congress made a choice between\ntwo different, basic arbitration schemes.\nAnd they chose the arbitration scheme that,\nin effect, does not allow the -- the kind of variation\nthat you're talking about. So they say the language is\nplain; the intent behind the language is plain. It is\nrestrictive, and you can't do that. What is your\nresponse, in effect, to the plain language construed in\nterms of the historical argument?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Well, the answer -- the\nplain language doesn't -- doesn't say what happens if\nthe parties reach a different agreement. The first --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it may not -- it may\nnot say it for the simple reason that it says\nunequivocally what should happen, and you are asking for\na variation on what it unequivocally provides. That may\nbe the reason it does not go into contingencies.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think -- well, first\nof all, it would seem to me less likely that that's\ntrue, given the common law history that comes out of\nJustice Story's opinion, which said restrictive\narbitrations are common.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. But you're --\nyou're ignoring -- when you say that, you're ignoring\nthe development of arbitration in the period after\nJustice Story; and you are ignoring the argument that\nthe other side makes that a deliberate choice was made\nbetween two generally understood arbitration, statutory\narbitration, schemes, and they choose -- they chose the\none that is inconsistent with your position.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Souter, there are two\n-- there are two questions there, so let me try to\nanswer both of your questions.\nThe first one is: What does the plain\nmeaning of the statute say? The plain meaning of the\nstatute, which is at 1a of the appendix to the petition,\nis the parties in their agreement agreed that a judgment\nof the court shall be entered upon the award. We never\nagreed to that, so the plain language of Section 9\nsimply doesn't get you there.\nSection 9 envisions that this is a -- that\nthis is an understanding.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then how can you get any\naward enforced, even subject to your terms?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because under Section 2 the\nparties have -- have provided a mechanism for that by\nsaying that the district court will correct an award if\nit's erroneous as a matter of law.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then you have to grapple\nwith the question whether in fact under Section 2 you\ncan provide for confirmation in a manner consistent with\nthe provision for confirmation under Section 9.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. But all I'm saying is\nthat Section 9 doesn't apply in this particular context,\nand, therefore, it makes all the sense in the world to\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You simply -- I -- I don't\n-- maybe I'm missing something, but you seem to stand\nthere and just say baldly: Section 9 doesn't apply. It\ndoesn't apply, you've repeated that several times. And\nI at least don't know why it doesn't apply.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, hopefully I can\npersuade you by rereading the portion of the statute,\nthat the first sentence of Section 9, which is at\nAppendix 1: \"If the parties\" --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Where is it? Where is it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: 1a of the appendix to the\npetition. Section 9: \"If the parties in their\nagreement have agreed that a judgment of the court shall\nbe entered upon the award\" --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Uh-huh.\nMR. PHILLIPS: These parties didn't agree\nthat a judgment would be entered on the award. They\nagreed that a judgment would be entered on the basis of\nwhether there was a non-erroneous declaration of law by\nthe arbitrator.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. And what you are\narguing is: At this point, even though we didn't agree\nwithin the meaning of the preamble to the first sentence\n--\nMR. PHILLIPS: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- we still have a right to\nhave the award confirmed and enforced --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- because we agreed to it\nunder Section 2.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Both parties agreed to it\nunder Section 2.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the question, I think,\nis when you argue in that fashion: Do you have a right\nunder Section 2 to provide for confirmation and\nenforcement under terms which are inconsistent with the\nprovision in Section 9.\nAnd I think that's the -- that's the\nquestion you've got to answer.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, if you -- if you want\nto make a judgment call and you think there's really a\njudgment you have to make as between Section 2 and\nSection 9, then it seems to me that all of the Court's\ndecisions have recognized that the single most important\nobjective of the Federal Arbitration Act is embodied in\nSection 2, which is -- which is to enforce the intent of\nthe parties --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The -- the cases --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- is you way you should come\nout.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The intent of the parties\nthat's being enforced in those myriad cases is the\nintent of the parties to arbitrate. I don't believe any\nof those cases respond to the -- to the issue that we've\ngot before us.\nAnd the issue we've got before us as you are\nnow framing it is this: If you do not have a provision\nwithin the meaning of the first sentence of Section 9 --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- for consummation and\nenforcement --\nMR. PHILLIPS: What do you do?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- but you have a different\ncontractual provision and its terms are different from\nthe enforcement terms under Section 9 --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- can that contract be\nrecognized? Do you have a right, in effect, to modify\nthe statute?\nMR. PHILLIPS: But, Justice Souter --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that's what you've got\nto come to grips with. And --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think I have come to\ngrips with it.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it does not answer\nthat question simply to say there are lots of cases\nsaying that the intent of the parties to arbitrate\nshould be enforced. This is a more specific question.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, it's not the intent of\nthe parties to arbitrate. It is every facet of the\nagreement is to be enforced consistent with the intent\nof the parties.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Where do you -- do you have\na case that says every facet of the agreement, no matter\nhow inconsistent arguably with other sections of the\nstatute?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, you don't.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, of course not, Justice\nSouter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's why we've got this\ncase here.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, to be sure. But the\nbottom line here -- and -- and I do want to answer the\nIllinois v. New York part of this, because I think\nthat's a complete red herring in this case.\nBut it still seems to me that if you think\nthat there is an ambiguity with respect to Section 9,\nfirst you should resolve that ambiguity by construing it\nto implement the parties' intent, because that is the\noverriding objection to the FAA. And second --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- if you go to Section 10 --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If we do that, we've got to\ndispose of the red herring. So you're going to come\nback to that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Okay. All right, let me\nanswer the red herring. Then -- then I'll tell you what\nI think about Section 10. On the red herring, all --\nall the -- first of all, there's nothing in the\nlegislative history that suggests that Congress made\nsome kind of conscious choice between New York and\nIllinois.\nThey talk about the New York model. There\nis not a word in the legislative history about Illinois.\nSo I don't think that's what the decision was.\nBut even if that were the choice they made,\nthat still doesn't go to the question of what do you do\nif the parties reach a different agreement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That is, indeed, the issue.\nWhat we're arguing about here is whether 9 and 10 are\nsimply default rules that apply where the parties have\nnot otherwise specified. That's -- and that's,\narguably, what the New York law and the Illinois -- I --\nI don't know that any of those cases cited by the other\nside involved cases where the Illinois rule or the New\nYork rule was applied in the teeth of an arbitration\nagreement that said something differently.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. None of -- None of those\ncases fall in that category.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In other words, I think\nboth the Illinois rule and the New York rule were\ndefault rules.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's exactly right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you're arguing that\nthis is the default rule?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It doesn't read like one.\n10 and 11 don't read like default --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the important\npart about Section 10 to keep in mind is -- is their\nargument also is predicated on the assumption that\nSection 10 exhaustively lists all of the grounds for\nmodifying an -- vacating an arbitration award. And it\nis absolutely clear from this Court's decisions both in\nWilko and in W.R. Grace that the list in Section 10 is\nnot an exclusive list.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What else is there\nbesides the manifest whatever? The --\nMR. PHILLIPS: The manifest disregard of the\nlaw and the -- and public policy. W.R. Grace says you\ncan't enforce any contract that violates public policy.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, on the\nquestion of whether it's just a default rule or a\nself-executing definition of what's permissible,\nsupposing the agreement between the parties provided\nthat the judgment by the court must be entered in 6\nmonths rather than a year, and it would be vitiated if\nit were entered after that. Would that trump the\nstatute?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- I think, yes, I think it\nprobably would, because --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I think under your theory\nyou'd have to --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't think Congress meant\nfor it to be -- I don't think Congress intended for this\nto be not subject to change.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean, you know, there are\n-- the question in all of these provisions is are there\nsome components of the FAA that are meant to be\nmandatory, and there are others that are all subject to\nchange. And I think that one strikes me at least as\nmost likely subject to change, Justice Stevens.\nIf there are no further questions, I'll\nreserve the balance of my time for rebuttal. Thank you,\nYour Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Phillips.\nMs. Brinkmann.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMS. BRINKMANN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nSections 9, 10 and 11 of the Federal\nArbitration Act provide the exclusive grounds on which a\ncourt can vacate, modify, correct an arbitration award\nunder the FAA. Those grounds do not include legal\nerror.\nWhat Petitioner wants is to graft on an\nadditional ground to that statute, and say, oh,\n10(A)(5), on any other ground that the parties agree to.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you do about the\nfact that our opinions have said that there is another\nground under 10, which is manifest miscarriage of\njustice? That's not listed there.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, manifest\ndisregard is Section 10 (A)(4), exceeding the power. It\nis not mere legal error, and it's manifest disregard of\nthe agreement. Section 10 goes to structural errors,\nstructural problems: Corruption, fraud, exceeding the\npower. And manifest disregard is in the statute, and\nit's not mere legal error.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why did we go -- go\nto the trouble of expressing it differently?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why not just say Section 4?\nMS. BRINKMANN: It was required in Wilko,\nbecause there were two different questions there. There\nwas a provision under the Securities Act that said\ncustomers couldn't waive certain right.\nAnd the court said there: Well, we all know\nthat the Securities Act generally would apply to\narbitration. Of course, if an arbitrator didn't apply\nthe Securities Act, that would be manifest disregard,\nexceeding their power. That they could not do.\nBut what the Wilko Court held was: The\ncustomer, if they went to arbitration, was also waiving\njudicial review of the arbitrator's interpretation of\nthe law. And that was the distinction in Wilko, and\nthat's why manifest disregard is in the statute. It's\n10(A)(4), and it's that type of error. It is not beyond\nthe statute, and that's what Congress meant to do.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about public policy?\nThat was the other one Mr. Phillips brought up.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes. Public policy would\noften be covered under Section 2. Section 2 allows any\narbitration contract to be voided under any generally\napplicable State contract law, so that clearly would\napply. A lot of that would capture off as public\npolicy. But \"public policy\" is used in different ways.\nThe Grace case he cites is a labor case.\nAnd there have been different developments of\narbitration under the labor statute. But what public\npolicy has come to mean in that line of cases is where\nthere is another Federal statute that is violated by the\narbitration.\nAnd there you have another source of law.\nIf there is a later enacted Federal statute that was a\ncongressional intent to trim the Arbitration Act, that's\nanother matter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What would happen in\nsituations like this? Suppose we agree with you; and we\nsay, oh, yes, both of the parties agreed as part of this\ncontract: I don't want to let these arbitrators decide\nthe law. If they get the law wrong, we want -- we want\nthe courts to decide the law. That's the deal. And\nthen you're going to say, oh, that portion of the\ncontract is no good.\nMS. BRINKMANN: You can't in that situation\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there no such thing as\n-- as failure of the contract for a misunderstanding of\nthe law?\nMS. BRINKMANN: That would be a common law\naction that the Chief Justice was referring to, to\nsimply enforce an award. But Section 9 created a\nstreamlined approach for enforcement of arbitration\nawards. When Congress in 1925 said --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think -- you think the\nState can enforce an arbitration award that would not be\nenforceable under the FAA?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Under Section 9. I hate to\nuse the words \"broadly FAA,\" because here's the\nsituation: You can have arbitration awards that are\nclearly covered under Section 2, but they are not\ncovered under Section 9. Section 9 is a streamlined\nprocedure for enforcement of arbitration where it's\nunder the FAA.\nWhen Congress enacted the statute, they\nsaid, you know, we are going to give a streamlined\napproach. If you want to go quickly from award to\njudgment, you can go right into court and hear Section\n9. That -- and you could agree to this. You have to\nagree to use Section 9. You have to agree to this\nconfirmation.\nYou come in, and that court must enforce\nthat award, confirm that award, unless Sections 10 and\n11 are met. And that's exactly what Congress did.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What happens\noutside -- that happens all the time. They are called\nconsent decrees. The party agrees, and agrees to\nparticular provisions, and they submit it to the judge\nand say: We want you to write two words, \"so ordered,\"\nat the bottom of this; and then it becomes a judgment.\nYou don't have to worry about the\nArbitration Act. It's a contract.\nMS. BRINKMANN: There are a couple of\ndifferences, I would also say, with the consent decree\nfrom the Section 9 enforcement of the award, Your Honor.\nHere, of course, Congress spoke to it. And it clearly\nset up a framework for Section 9, 10, and 11: How could\nyou have this streamlined, efficient, final way to get a\njudgment. That was the purpose of the FAA.\nSo you don't have that in a consent decree\nsituation, and you would not have that in a common law\ncontract action.\nAlso, of course, in that consent decree\nsituation, courts maintain their equitable authority.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I have the same\nquestion for you that I had for your friend: Why do you\ncare? I mean, if you are saying, look, you can enforce\nthis as a state law contract -- you know, it's not\nstreamlined. The judge doesn't have to do it; but, you\nknow, this judge wants to do it. And he is going to\nenforce it as a State law contract.\nWhat do you gain?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, we gain a little of\nwhat we try to get through arbitration: Finality, the\ncessation of the time and cost that this litigation has\narisen.\nWe prevail under the ruling of the court\nthat recognized the exclusivity of Sections 9, 10 and\n11; and that would end the litigation. That's certainly\nof very great interest to our client.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you say to\nMr. Phillips' argument that, within the meaning of the\nfirst sentence of Section 9, you don't have any\nagreement at all; and, therefore, you have no right to\nenforce anything?\nI take it that's not the position you took\nbelow, and that's not the position you're taking here,\nbut how do you answer him?\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's really a repackaging\nof Petitioner's severability argument from below. There\nwas an agreement to confirm. It's just whether or not\nif the -- it becomes legally impossible for the other\ncondition to occur, the legal review can't occur because\nit's contrary to the statute.\nWhat happened -- and the court of appeals\nhere addressed that issue, applied Oregon law, and\nrejected it. Petitioner filed a rehearing en banc\npetition on that and did not bring it to this Court on\ncert.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Assume we agree with you\nthat this is a quick and dirty way to get arbitration\nagreements enforced if you want to bring it within 9 and\n10, and if you don't, you're free not to; you can go to\nthe State courts. Why can't he still go to the State\ncourts?\nYou say this is going to terminate the\nlitigation. Is this going to be res judicata on\nanything? All it's going to say is the Federal courts\nhave no jurisdiction over this. It's not under 9 and\n10. You're going to run off to State court. You're\ngoing to protract the litigation rather than bring it to\na quick end.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, this is under\nSection 9. The only way it would not be under Section 9\nis if they had won on the severability argument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that.\nMS. BRINKMANN: We thought --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Miss Brinkmann, can we\nback up a bit, because this agreement had an usual\ngenesis. This was a big case, and the judge kept right\nin the court a piece of it. And then he and the parties\nagreed that another piece of it would best be resolved\nin arbitration. So the judge was in equal participation\nin that effort. All three parties wanted to get a\nparticular issue resolved through an arbitrator rather\nthan the court, itself.\nAnd I doubt very much whether the judge\nwould have been at all interested in that scheme if he\nthought he were doing an idle thing. That the parties,\nhaving agreed to just what the judge thought was a nice\nway to resolve this issue, would then find themselves\nout of Federal court and have to bring some kind of suit\nin State court. It doesn't seem to fit this scenario.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Two responses, at least to\nthat, Your Honor: Then the parties should have asked\nthe court to appoint a special master. That maintains\nunder the authority of the district court judge. That's\nnot what happened here. And that's important.\nWhat is before the Court here is the Section\n9 action to confirm the judgment. And that's what comes\nto the Court on --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have to go\nback to State court. You have diversity. You are in\nFederal court, no matter what; right?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor, that's\nright.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's why just what you\nsaid is actually what's worrying me about the case.\nBecause what Justice Ginsburg said makes me think that\nthere could be situations, a lot of situations, where\nFederal judges do want to peel the case off. And you\nsay send it to a master. Maybe some would lend\nthemselves to a master; maybe some wouldn't. I have no\nidea.\nAnd are we going to have to hold in this\ncase whether a judge or when a judge, a Federal judge,\ndoes or does not have authority to do such a thing?\nThat's why I say -- I was actually thinking\nthe case of the century, because it's going to take a\nhundred years to finish.\nBut the fact is there are those issues there\nonce we say Section 9 doesn't apply. Then you're going\nto have to say -- suppose we were to say it's just State\nlaw. Well, suppose the State doesn't allow enforcement\nof this kind of contract? Then we have the question of\nthe authority -- of the inherent authority, not\nstatutory, of a Federal district judge to peel off bits\nof cases and decide them in different ways.\nI don't know the answer to those questions,\nbut I think they are quite important. So what do I do?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, first of all, Your\nHonor, if it comes to a question about the particular\nfacts in this case involving the scenario that Justice\nGinsburg put forth of the very unusual situation of a\nFederal district court being there, we would, of course,\ndismiss the writ as improperly granted. That has no\nbroader implication, I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, because there is a\nholding in the whole Ninth Circuit, which accounts for a\nlarge percent of the country, that the district judge\ncan't do this. And that's quite a significant holding\nin that circuit, and we ought to review that.\nMS. BRINKMANN: That would be the question,\nYour Honor, if when faced with something that a judge\nwants to peel off, you have to look at what tools a\nFederal judge has been given. Magistrate judges widely\nused for all types of picking juries, discovery, special\nmasters, those are the tools that have been given to\nFederal judges. When arbitration --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not use -- why not\nuse Rule 16, pretrial procedure, and the parties and the\njudge can work out what they think is the most efficient\nway to resolve this controversy? So they decide at the\npretrial conference that they are going to build into\nthis arrangement one issue that they are going to peel\noff to go to an arbitrator, but the judge is going to\nretain control through the legal error.\nMS. BRINKMANN: The arbitrator is what\nintroduces these different elements, because that's a\nprivate judge chosen by the parties, paid by the\nparties. He doesn't have life tenure. It's a very\ndifferent animal. And what Congress did in the Federal\nArbitration Act --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a strange argument\nin this respect. You are arguing that this non-Article\nIII person has more control rather than less control;\nthat if the judge controlled this arbitrator, somehow\nthat would violate Article III.\nBut if the judge has no control and is\nessentially little more than a rubber stamp on what the\nnon-Article III person does, then that's all right. And\nthe sense of that doesn't come across to me.\nMS. BRINKMANN: It's because it's a matter\nof contract law, Justice Ginsburg. The parties agreed\nto an arbitration here on a contract and the\narbitrator's award speaks for the parties. It is their\nagreement. That's what an arbitration award is, and\nthat's why this streamlined process under Section 9 to\ntransfer that award, that contractual agreement --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but the question is\nwhether or not that streamlined process is the only\nprocess. It seems to me that if the purpose of the\nArbitration Act is to promote confidence in the\narbitration process, that if parties agree to have the\ndouble assurance that the arbitrator hasn't made some\nstrange ruling of law, that that's quite consistent with\nthe whole purposes of arbitration.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, we are not\nsuggesting that it's the only means to get an award\nenforced, but if you are doing the Section 9 route, the\ngrounds in the statute are the only grounds on which\nthat can be done, and the policy about whether or not\nthose transaction costs, when parties want further\nreview on an arbitration, is shifted to the courts.\nIt's one Congress made --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're -- you're\nasking us to interpret the statute; and let us assume\nthat it's a plausible interpretation and interpret the\nstatute as the Petitioner would. You know, under\nSection 8, the parties can use the authority of the\ncourt to libel a ship. The court is extending its\nauthority to -- to use very intrusive means, and to say\nthat the parties can't ensure, if they choose, to have\nreview for correct errors of law -- to correct errors of\nlaw when the ship has been seized, it seems to me to\npromote the whole purposes of the act.\nMS. BRINKMANN: But, Your Honor, I think\nthat's where we get to -- between when we are talking\nabout Section 2 and the purpose is that the parties\ncontrol how the arbitration progresses. Then we come to\nthe entry of the judgment by a court, and that's what\nCongress controls; and the grounds in 10 and 11 cannot\nbe perceived as default rules. There are many places in\nthe Federal Arbitration Act where --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we're arguing about\nthat textually. I'm saying that there's nothing\ninconsistent with the Petitioner's position and the\nbasic policies of the act. You talk about finality,\nstreamline, and so forth; but if the parties have more\nconfidence in the arbitration process by ensuring this\nadded level of review, it seems to me quite consistent\nwith the purposes of the act.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, two things, Your\nHonor. If they want to do that, then they don't choose\nSection 9, and they don't include an agreement for\nSection 9, and then they have what Chief Justice Roberts\nwas talking about, a -- a state contract action --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I interrupt on that\nfor just a minute? You're assuming and the Chief\nJustice's line of questioning was assuming there's an\nadequate state remedy available for enforcing this\ncontract, but the whole premise of the statute at the\ntime it was enacted was that there was not a state\nremedy, because there was a bias against arbitration.\nAnd this was thought to be the sole remedy for\narbitration at the time the statute was enacted.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, that actually\nbrings me to a red herring. I'd like to address the\nhistory, because I think that what happens in\nPetitioner's reply brief, there's some confusion between\ncommon-law causes of action to enforce an arbitration\naward as a contract, and actions under statutes. Some\nof the commentators confuse that also.\nThere was an opportunity to have judicial\nreview of the law through a contract enforcement case,\nalthough there was a clear statement requirement. So\nthere are going to be cases that talk about, that are\nnot under the statue. Then when you look at cases under\nthe statute, you have to differentiate between the cases\nunder the New York model statutes, where you will not\nfind that, and cases under the Illinois statute, where\nyou will, because they allow judicial review.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there any --\nMS. BRINKMANN: Now, when Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there any -- are\nthere any such States left today that are using the\nIllinois model?\nMS. BRINKMANN: I believe not, Your Honor.\nWe explain in one of our footnotes that that came into\ndisfavor.\nBut I want to address Justice Scalia's point\nabout the legislative history. There is no case that we\nhave found that says, notwithstanding those statutory\ngrounds, you can contract beyond them, but we do have\nnot only the New York cases, but also in footnote 8, I\nbelieve, on page 30, several other statutes have\nstatutory grounds, and repeatedly they say these are the\nstatutory grounds. That is separate from the common-law\naction where you could have a full jury trial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but the old Illinois\nand the old New York rules, you don't have any cases\nwhich say -- which establish that those rules were not\njust default rules, but you -- but you were not allowed\nto depart from them.\nMS. BRINKMANN: We think the language in\nthose cases will speak -- -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't -- you don't have\nany case that holds that?\nMS. BRINKMANN: The cases say things like on\nthe statutory grounds, where they do say it. Do they go\nthe next step and say by the way, we are not going to do\nanything else that's -- -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have any case\nthat holds that.\nMS. BRINKMANN: No. No. There's none on\nthe other side, either.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there a possibility\nthat the reason the language in the statute is as it\nis -- when was the Federal Arbitration Act; what year\nwas it?\nMS. BRINKMANN: 1925.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And there was still\nabroad in the land considerable distrust of arbitrators.\nJudges said arbitrators are stepping on our turf, and so\nthey would be naturally resistant to let the arbitrator\ngo ahead and have the most minimal review in court.\nMaybe the act was written the way it was to say, if the\nparties want to go to arbitration, courts, you stay out\nof it.\nMS. BRINKMANN: If you choose that -- yes,\nYour Honor. And even one more step. But we will tell\nthe court to stay out of it only if you agree that\nyou're going to come under for confirmation. It's still\nlet the parties have the review through common law if\nthey want it.\nThat's absolutely correct, Your Honor. And\nI think it's that additional step, though, that puts the\nwhole picture together. And I do want to emphasize,\nthere is appellate arbitration that takes care all of\nthe policy concerns about whether or not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you -- would you\nagree that what we hold in this case applies to suits in\nadmiralty, where you don't go to State court under\nSection 8?\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's a difficult question,\nYour Honor. I have looked at many of the old -- some of\nthe arbitration cases did come up from admiralty, and I\nthink the answer is, if it is an action under Section 9\nto confirm, it must be confirmed unless there is\nvacatur, modification, or correction under 10 or 11.\nThose are exclusive grounds.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, at this point you\ndon't have a State court fallback for your argument.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -- I can't say why\nit isn't -- I just repeat my earlier point -- quite\nconsistent with encouraging confidence in admiralty\narbitration to allow district courts to review rulings\non a matter of law if the parties so choose.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I think that question,\nthough, perhaps goes to more or not whether the Section\n9 is the exclusive means for enforcing an award, and it\nisn't. So perhaps there is some other means that is\nbeyond my expertise.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, if there is, then let's\nthink -- suppose that in the middle of a trial, the\nparties say, judge, this is so complicated factually, we\nhave a way that we can get an agreed statement of facts.\nThey walk out the door; they have a friend who has a\nsign called arbitrator; and they come away from that\nfriend with an agreed statement of facts, which they\nagree to submit to the judge to apply the law. Now,\nthere is nothing wrong with that, I imagine.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, that sign would have\nto be changed. It would have to say --\nJUSTICE BREYER: We know -- I'm sorry. I'm\nnot even going to tell the judge how I find this. I go\nto a crystal ball; I go to any way I want. I will come\nin with an agreed statement of facts, and is there\nanything, if we have that agreed statement of facts,\nthat would will stop the judge from saying I take this\nagreed statement of facts; there's a difference about\nhow the law applies to it; I will resolve this case?\nMS. BRINKMANN: There are a couple of\nthings. That's not an arbitration award.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, no -- I just say --\nwell, I'll ask you the next question. I take the answer\nto the first question is there's nothing wrong with\nthat.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I have to say --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't there --\nMS. BRINKMANN: -- the court would not be\nbound by that. It's not a mandatory standard.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry. I thought that,\nif in fact parties come in with an agreed statement of\nfact in a case, I've never seen a situation where the\njudge couldn't say, fine, I agree; that's the -- the\njudge would say I'm sorry, even though you agree, I\ninsist that you go to trial and?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He can?\nMS. BRINKMANN: I think, I think there would\nbe a State bar --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure, if the parties\nagree, and here's our stipulation: We agree that he is\na citizen of Pennsylvania and you're a citizen of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, so there are\npublic policy limitations.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, and it's collusion.\nIt goes to our argument.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, is there anything\nwrong here? My question basically, obviously, is, is\nthere anything wrong in this case if they had come in\nwith an agreed statement of fact?\nMS. BRINKMANN: I think it would have\ndepended on what the court did with it. So long as it\nwas not binding on the Federal court, because you can't\nbuy an injunction. You cannot stipulate to the\nerroneous law. The Article III judge maintained that\nauthority.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. I'm trying to\nget to my question; I'm not asking it very well.\nWhat they agreed to is an agreed statement\nof facts, subject to Section 9 standards, Section 9 and\n10.\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's difficult, because\nit's an award --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I'm driving at,\nwhether I've asked it well or not --\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes, right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is is how is it any\ndifferent from coming in with an agreed statement of\nfacts?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Because this is an\narbitration award. It is a contractual agreement where\nthe award gives -- imposes a legal obligation on someone\nelse, and that award is going to be entered as a\njudgment of the court, against the parties.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this sort of\nbasic question? Forgetting the text for a minute, what\npolicy reason -- can you think of why would Congress\nwant to prohibit this particular form of agreement?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Congress wanted to give\nparties an option for a quick, simple, cost-effective\nand final way --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why would they want to\nprohibit an option that takes a little bit longer?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Because that would be a\ndifferent action where you have to look to State\ncontract law, contract law defenses, whether there are\nState arbitration laws -- it's a different animal. They\nwere looking at the animal of an arbitration agreement\nand a streamlined method to have that enforced and\nthat's what Sections 9, 10, and 11 do.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your\nanswer would be part the point Justice Stevens brought\nup earlier. There was this State hostility to enforcing\narbitration agreements at all --\nMS. BRINKMANN: Uh-huh.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so what the\nFederal Arbitration Act says is, all right, in the\nnarrow circumstances where the parties agreed, subject\nto this narrow standard, you have to enforce it. But\nthat doesn't mean we are going to override the State law\nacross the board.\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's right. It gives the\nparties the option for choosing that, and if you choose\nthat, you have to do what Congress says.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why do they want to\nprevent the parties from choosing the option they chose\nin this case? I don't think that answer says why they'd\nwant to do that.\nMS. BRINKMANN: They can choose another\noption, but they may have a full-blown trial about\ncontract law in the award, and that's what Section 9\nwould --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But then there'd be no\narbitration at all. That's right.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I also have --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But I just don't\nunderstand why it makes any sense at all to say this\ntype of arbitration agreement is invalid.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I would add --\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, we're not\nsaying it's invalid.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I would add that in\nadmiralty you don't have the back-up of State law.\nMS. BRINKMANN: We're not saying it's\ninvalid, Your Honor. We're saying that there's\nentitlement to confirmation of the award unless the\ngrounds of 10 and 11 are there. And Petitioner wants to\ngraft on the thing that says \"or on any ground the\nparties agree on.\" There's no limit to that, Your\nHonor. There's nothing for harmless error --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the question is\nstill here: Why should there be a limit if the parties\nthemselves agree? Because if they didn't come in under\narbitration and they simply came in under contract or\nwhatever the causes of action might be in a diversity\ncase, the court would have to be dealing with these\nissues anyway.\nMS. BRINKMANN: It would be under a\ndifferent cause of action, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Pardon me?\nMS. BRINKMANN: You'd be under State\ncontract law. Here you'd have to develop a Federal\ncommon law of when you took a Section 9 and you started\nreviewing it for error. Are we really going to allow de\nnovo review and vacatur when it's harmless? There's a\nwhole body of Federal law that has developed about\nharmless error to address those kinds of issues. This\nwould be a Federal --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's true in any\ndiversity case.\nMS. BRINKMANN: But, Your Honor, this would\nbe under the Federal Arbitration Act. Without any\nguidance from Congress, contrary to the grounds they put\nforward. And they have no limit.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, why didn't Congress\ngive any guidance? One suggestion that the Chief\nJustice made, and it played through my mind, is maybe\nthe -- what seemed to be the plain language limits in\nSection 9 represent not necessarily a kind of policy\nchoice in a perfect world, but a political policy\nchoice. Maybe that was the term as you -- as you read\nSection 9, maybe that was the term upon which the act\ncould be passed.\nMS. BRINKMANN: It was --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We will, in effect -- we\nwill say: Look, you got to enforce these contracts,\narbitration contracts, but you don't have to go one step\nfurther. Maybe that was the political deal. Is there\nany indication that that was the case and that's the\nexplanation for this limit?\nMS. BRINKMANN: With all respect, I think\nnot. I think that the Section 2 and 3, the enforcement\nof the arbitration agreement, is about the private\nparties determining the process. But when you get to\nthe entry of a judgment by a court on the award, what\nCongress did said: We're going to give you an option to\nhave an efficient, streamlined way for that also, and\nhere it is: 9, 10 and 11. Now, you still have\nsomething else and you have to agree to this in your\nagreement, but if you agree to it, this is what you\nhave.\nAnd I have to say Petitioner's argument is\nso broad, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, there were\nquestions of fact in this. We were -- we were\nlitigating under this agreement also in the district\ncourt, and we brought a question of fact to the district\ncourt. When the district court first sent this back to\nthe arbitrator, it went through and basically told the\narbitrator: You know, you haven't looked at these\nfacts; you haven't looked at these fact; you haven't\nlooked at these facts. I believe it's Pet. App. 57a.\nAnd it sent it back to show the arbitrator's work. I\nmean that is what --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that what --\nMS. BRINKMANN: -- courts would get mired in\nunder a common law development standard of review,\naccording to what --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Has that been a nightmare\n-- has it been the nightmare you suggest in labor\narbitration? Because I think labor arbitration falls\noutside the act, doesn't it?\nMS. BRINKMANN: It does.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And has that turned into\nsome kind of terrible nightmare where there are dozens\nof rules and they have a long complicated labor set of\nregulations on it? I don't think so, but has it?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Well, Your Honor, I'm not as\nfamiliar with that perhaps as I should be, but I know --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if we run that pretty\nwell, why wouldn't you run this pretty well --\nMS. BRINKMANN: I think the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- given a back-up, looking\nat it as a default?\nMS. BRINKMANN: I think they're very\ndifferent policies and different statutory frameworks\nthat apply.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's take this\nstatute and let's take the circuits that have the rule,\nthe opposite rule. In fact, the Ninth Circuit had the\nopposite rule until rather recently. What has been the\nexperience -- I think the Fifth Circuit is on the other\nside?\nMS. BRINKMANN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What has been the\nexperience there?\nMS. BRINKMANN: There has not been\nwidespread use of this provision. I think that our\namici briefs really speak to this, Your Honor, because\nthe difference would be a statement by the U.S. Supreme\nCourt that says parties can now create whatever other\ngrounds they want and go in through Section 9 in a\nstreamlined process and are going to impose on Federal\ncourts, not appellate arbitrators, on Federal courts,\nwhatever grounds they want -- de novo review of fact, no\nharmless error, perhaps create different appellate\nstandards when it goes up.\nAnd I think that the amici really point out\nthat that is so contrary to the finality and\nefficiencies that the animal of arbitration --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think a lot of those\nhorribles, Mr. Phillips would agree with you because he\nhesitated even on de novo, and I think he thought that\ntrying to control an appeal from the district court,\nthat would be out of the ballpark.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I think it would create a\nhybrid animal that is not what the Arbitration Act is\nabout.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why couldn't you limit it\nreasonably by saying the parties can agree to anything?\nWe would only have to say at least, the parties can at\nleast agree to anything that the court would be able to\ndo if this had been brought as an action in the court,\nrather than initially as an arbitration.\nMS. BRINKMANN: With all due respect --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which means the court would\ndecide the questions of law.\nMS. BRINKMANN: With all due respect, Your\nHonor, that would be for Congress to do, not this Court.\nThis is a statutory framework, a statutory cause of\naction that Congress wrote.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand, but that\nwould be a limit. You say it's limitless. It doesn't\nhave to be limitless.\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, but you're putting --\nyou are, I think, as this Court itself has said, you're\nbreeding litigation from a statute whose whole point was\nto minimize and limit litigation. You're creating a new\nbody of Federal common law that's really antithetical to\nthe core purpose of the Arbitration Act. And I think\nthat the -- that overriding principle of Federal\nArbitration Act should really motivate the Court to\nrealize what Congress did and the exclusive grounds that\nthey set forth.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But one problem that I\nhave with your position is you say that the -- you\nshould continue to prevail, although that would be in\nviolation of the parties' agreement. Under the Ninth\nCircuit decision, you win, what the arbitrator says\ngoes, and there isn't the review that the parties\nbargained for.\nMS. BRINKMANN: That's the severability\npoint that they lost on, Your Honor. They had\npetitioned for cert on severability and tried to say\nbecause the judicial review became legally impossible\nthe rest should have followed. We'd be arguing a\ndifferent case. They petitioned for rehearing en banc\nreview on that and did not petition for cert on that.\nBut that is answered by the severability ruling below.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the parties have an\narbitration agreement in which they said, if there are\ncontested issues of law, either party may seek\ndeclaratory judgment?\nMS. BRINKMANN: In court?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In a Federal court, under\nthe Declaratory Judgment Act.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I don't know if that would\nbe an arbitration agreement. I'm not sure what the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My hypothetical is it's in\nthe arbitration agreement. If the arbitrator gets stuck\non a difficult question of law, either party can seek\ndeclaratory relief, and the arbitration proceedings are\nheld in abeyance pending that declaration.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I hesitate because it sounds\nlike that may just be an advisory opinion, and there\nmight be an Article III problem with that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. There's the advisory\n-- we've been through this. This is a real controversy,\nnot an advisory opinion.\nMS. BRINKMANN: Then they can go and have --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think the reason you\nhesitated to answer yes might be inconsistent with your\nposition.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BRINKMANN: No, I don't think so, Your\nHonor. I think that if they have a declaratory\njudgment, then they'll have a judgment. I don't know\nwhy they would ever go back to the arbitrator. That's\nwhat I'm not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There are lots of other\nthings for the arbitrator to do. He's got some specific\nissues of law that are contested.\nMS. BRINKMANN: I don't see how that is\ninconsistent with a party independently going for a\ndeclaratory judgment action. I don't think that's\ncontrary to our position, Your Honor.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nBrinkmann.\nMr. Phillips, you have you 5 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI'll try to give you back some of that time before I'm\ndone.\nIn my experience in evaluating cases like\nthis, it seems to me that in some ways where you end up\ndepends in large measure on where you start. And the\nparties fundamentally disagree about whether or not this\nis an agreement that should be -- you know, who's got\nthe burden? Do we have to show that this agreement is\nauthorized by something or are we entitled to have this\nagreement and it's their burden to demonstrate clearly\nthat Congress meant not to allow this to be enforced?\nAnd it seems to me clear that the answer to that is that\nit's their burden to find something specific in the\nFederal Arbitration Act or otherwise that precludes\nthis.\nSection 9 doesn't get them there because\nSection 9 is predicated always on an agreement of the\nparties in the first instance, and so that's not a basis\nfor doing that, but even if you thought Section --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you say about her\nargument that we are limited in considering your\nargument by the severability ruling that you didn't\nappeal?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't see how the\nseverability ruling has any relevance to this particular\nproblem, because what we're saying is we are entitled to\nenforce the -- the agreement of the parties with respect\nto exactly what the district court has the authority to\ndo. The fact that it -- whether it's severable or not\nseverable doesn't mean that we're not entitled to the\nenforcement of the agreement as written by the parties.\nSeverability doesn't eliminate our right to have that\npart of the agreement --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it does -- it does\npreclude -- I mean, her answer is an answer to the\nargument that you were making in response to a question\nof mine earlier, that in fact you don't have an\nagreement within the meaning of the preamble portion of\nSection 9. She says you do because you have one after\nseverance and you didn't appeal severability.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but all I'm saying is\nthat I think that puts the cart before the horse.\nRemember, severability only comes up after the court of\nappeals had decided that this provision in the contract\nwas unenforceable. And then the question is, is there\nany part -- you know, is the entire arbitration set\naside.\nAnd what I'm saying is that initial decision\nis wrong. And, therefore, you don't have to worry about\nseverability. And the reason why it's wrong is because\nit's their burden to show something in the Federal\nArbitration Act that's, that precludes enforcement of\nthis provision. Section 9 doesn't get you there.\nSection 10 wouldn't get you there because it's not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Remind me why Section 9\ndoesn't get you there -- because of the \"if\" clause.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Because of the \"if\"\nclause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If the parties in their\nagreement have agreed that a judgment of a court shall\nbe entered upon the award made pursuant to -- but they\nhave agreed to that, haven't they?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well no --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The question is simply --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Subject to the condition that\nthe district court would make a determination that there\nwas no error in law. And that -- I mean, that's -- you\nknow, they had -- I mean --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is, why is that\ncondition excluded from the \"if\" clause, but all of the\nother conditions that are set forth in 10 are not\nexcluded from the \"if\" clause? I mean, it seems to me\nthe \"if\" clause must embrace any conditions.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. But the point is if,\nif all you do is agree to an arbitration, then Section 9\nand Section 10 apply directly. But if you agree to an\narbitration that is subject to legal error or review,\nokay, then the \"if\" clause doesn't prevent you from\nbeing allowed to have that portion enforced, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if you agree on\ncondition and the conditions are satisfied, are you\nsaying that the district court must enforce under\nSection 9, or are you saying that enforcement would be\nunder some other authority?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think the enforcement would\nbe under the existing authority that the district court\nhad in this particular case, because this was a case\nthat was pending before the district court under\ndiversity jurisdiction seeking to enforce the lease\nagreement. And we have a final decision from the\narbitrator. The judge has now made a decision that that\nis wrong as a matter of law and has enforced the lease\nin a particular way.\nAnd so the question is, is that judgment of\nthe district court subject to challenge? And our answer\nto that is no. There is nothing in the Federal\nArbitration Act that prevents the district judge from\ndoing precisely what it did.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure why you have\nto give the answer you just gave to Justice Alito, if\nwhat you told Justice Scalia is correct, that the \"if\"\nclause includes the condition that the court reviewed\nfor issues -- for errors of law.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm not sure there is any\ninconsistency between those two things, between those\ntwo things -- statements.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- but you're arguing\nto Justice Scalia that Section 9 works because you could\ninterpret the \"if\" clause that way.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now you're telling Justice\nScalia, oh, well, it's a different action. We have got\nthe action here anyway.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, all I'm saying\nis that we can win on either theory.\nMy whole point here has been Section 9\ndoesn't prevent us from being able to do this. Section\n10 is not an exhaustive list and, therefore, we are\nallowed to add to Section 10. And at the end of the\nday, regardless, you ought to interpret this under\nSection 2, consistent with the intent of the parties to\nensure that we get what we want.\nThe one point I did want to make about how\nall of this operates is, you know, in the relationship\nbetween the courts and arbitrators, it seems to there is\nprobably no more important issue than who decides\nwhether something is arbitratable. And yet, this Court\nheld quite clearly in First Options that even though the\nstatute says it's the arbitrator -- I mean, that it's\nthe court, it can be made the arbitrator by the parties.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
