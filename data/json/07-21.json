        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in Case 07-21 and 07-25, Crawford v. Marion\nCounty Election Board and Indiana Democratic Party v.\nSecretary Rokita.\nMr. Smith.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case involves a law that directly\nburdens our most fundamental right, the right to vote.\nThose Indiana voters who lack the identification now\nrequired by the new photo ID law must overcome\nsubstantial practical and financial burdens before they\ncan continue to exercise their constitutional right.\nNow, the State says that those burdens are justified by\nthe need to stamp out the scourge of voter impersonation\nfraud at the polls, but this Court has made clear many\ntimes that such a justification should not just be\naccepted at face value, but instead it should be\nscrutinized to assure that the claimed State interest is\nboth real and sufficiently weighty to justify the burden\nbeing imposed on constitutional rights.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Before -- before we get to\nthat, can we talk about standing a little? Who are\nthe -- who are the complainants here?\nMR. SMITH: There are many plaintiffs, Your\nHonor, including the ones that the courts below found\nhave standing, the Democratic Party.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Courts below are sometimes\nwrong.\nMR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor, absolutely, and\nespecially when I'm a petitioner I agree with you on\nthat. But in this case, Your Honor, the Democratic\nParty was found to have standing correctly, I believe,\non at least two grounds, associational standing as well\nas what you might call haven standing, the\norganizational interest being impaired by virtue of this\nlaw.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they still have to\nidentify individuals who are members. Now, what does it\ntake to be a member of the Democratic Party here?\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, in Indiana you\nbecome a member of the Democratic Party by participating\nin party affairs. They did identify members who are\nactivists, who are poll workers, and that's why the\ndistrict court said that as, as to the equal protection\nclaim those people were sufficient to satisfy\nassociational standing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought -- I thought they\ntook the position that anybody who voted or intended to\nvote Democratic is a member of the Democratic Party.\nMR. SMITH: Well, there are different\ndegrees of membership, different ways to become a\nmember, as this Court has recognized --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any way in which\nyou can say -- and I thought this was the theory of\nassociational standing -- that this individual has\nvoluntarily given this organization the right to\nrepresent that person for particular purposes?\nMR. SMITH: There is no formal method of\ninduction as you would have in the Elk's Club or\nsomething, Your Honor. But there clearly are methods by\nwhich you become a participant in the affairs of the\nparty. For example, to vote in the primary you have to\naver that you have either supported Democratic\ncandidates in the last election or intend to in a future\nelection.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that doesn't mean that\nI'm willing to have the Democratic Party represent me\nfor all sorts of purposes. And these people can bring\ntheir own individual challenges. I mean, I'm not\nquestioning their ability to do it. But, but why is the\nDemocratic Party their representative?\nMR. SMITH: Because they have -- the\nDemocratic Party is an association of people joined\ntogether to elect candidates of a particular kind and\nthose people include many people who are burdened by\nthis law. This seems to be the absolutely\nquintessential case for associational standing, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: As I understand it, though,\nMr. Smith, the trial court didn't rely on, simply on the\nassociational standing of the Democratic Party, did it?\nMR. SMITH: No, that's correct, Your Honor.\nWell, the court of appeals relied as well on Havens\nRealty and said that the organizational interests of the\nparty are being impaired by virtue of the fact that this\nis putting a burden on them achieving their goal, the\nDemocratic Party's goal, of electing its candidates.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And is doing so by forcing\nthem to get people properly identified.\nMR. SMITH: Extend resources getting people,\nget their identification. It's very much like the\nMetropolitan Washington Airports Authority case which we\ncited in our brief, which involved a nonprofit\norganization aimed at trying to keep the noise level\ndown at National Airport that was impaired by an\nunconstitutional statute in that case as well.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That organization had\nmembers. I mean, you did join that organization.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And they identified members\nwho would be, who would be annoyed by the noise.\nMR. SMITH: I'd note, Your Honor, that in\nthe Hunt case itself there were no members. The Court\nsaid it doesn't really matter because the State agency\nthat had associational standing in Hunt functioned for\nall purposes as the representatives of those, of those\napple farmers, but there was no formal membership\norganization, no members per se at all. But the Court\nsaid that shouldn't make a difference because there's\nreally no actual functional difference between the two\nsituations. I would certainly submit --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I just think it's hard to\nconfine your rationale if you say that any association\ncould sue. If it says, you know, there are people that\nif they knew what we were doing, if they knew this\nproblem they would really want us to sue on their\nbehalf, I don't know if I'm going to confine your\nrationale.\nMR. SMITH: Well Your Honor, the thing that\nconfines the rationale is it has to be something that\nrelates as well to the purpose of the organization, of\nthe association, the reason why these people are bound\ntogether as a group, and that is of course to get people\nto vote and vote to support -- support the goals of the\norganization, support the candidates, the nominees of\nthe organization.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We can limit your\nstanding argument to -- I guess it's based on the\naffidavits of Ms. Holland and Ms. Smith, the one who is\na clerk for the Democratic Party and the other who is a\njudge for the Democratic Party. We don't have to agree\nwith you that anybody who votes, might vote Democratic,\nis enough to give you standing.\nMR. SMITH: But we also have other people in\nthe record, Your Honor -- for example, Theresa Clemente,\nothers who are active poll workers, activists in the\nparty, who -- had been polled and found that they didn't\nhave IDs and that they would be burdened by the\ndifficulty of getting IDs. So that that -- there is\nspecific standing evidence in there of specific people\nwho, much more than just your average voter, are active\nin party affairs. They may not have a -- be\ncard-carrying members of the Democratic Party, but they\nare as much a part of the Democratic Party as anybody\npossibly could be, who were identified in response to\ninterrogatories, about 9 or 10 of them, and were found\nto be satisfactory for purposes of standing by the\ndistrict court on the equal protection claim.\nNow, in addition I would note as I suggested\nto Justice Souter, you don't have to go to the\nassociational standing because the Democratic Party\nclearly is injured in its own right as an organization.\nNow, if I could turn to the merits then, the\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Even in its own\nright, it has to identify somebody that's a member or\nnot.\nMR. SMITH: No. When it's in its own right\nthe association, the organization, is injured, Your\nHonor. Now, the question -- if what you're suggesting,\nis there enough evidence here that people are actually\nbeing prevented from voting?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly, Democrats in\nparticular, I suppose.\nMR. SMITH: A great deal of evidence in the\nrecord of the burdens that are imposed on people who try\nto comply with this law and continue exercising their\nconstitutional right to vote.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I understood\nJudge Barker to say that you had not come up with a\nsingle instance of somebody who was denied the right to\nvote because they didn't have a photo ID.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, the record in\nthis case was made when an election had not yet\nhappened. So that comment, while it was certainly made,\nI don't quite understand its significance. This case\nwas brought to try to prevent an irreparable loss of\nconstitutional rights in advance of the implementation\nof this law. I think it had been used in two little\ntowns in '05, Montezuma, Indiana, but other than that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So elections were\nconducted under this law?\nMR. SMITH: I'm not even -- there were a\ncouple of hundred people that had voted under the law,\nbut nobody else had yet, at that point. Now, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, did you have anybody\nwho said, I don't have a voter ID?\nMR. SMITH: Yes, we did, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I plan to come in this next\nelection, I plan to vote, and I don't have a voter ID\ncard?\nMR. SMITH: Yes, we did, Your Honor. That's\nthe 9 or 10 people who came from the poll worker survey.\nThere was also a considerable amount of testimony about\nother people who said they wanted to vote, who spoke to\nmany of the other plaintiffs, Mr. Crawford, the NAACP\nchapter. There's a lot of other plaintiffs who also\nsubmitted evidence of people saying: I don't have an\nID, I'm not going to be able to get one, I'm not going\nto be able to vote.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But why -- and\nthey're not going to be able to get one even though the\nState will provide them with one if they don't have one,\nsubject to some identification?\nMR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. But what the\nState did in 2002 was it ratcheted up the difficulty of\ngetting one by requiring for the first time that you\nhave an original certified birth certificate that you\npaid for and that -- and then you have to go through the\nhoops of what kind of identification you need for that.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, is it your position\nthat a State can't require any form of identification\nand can only require a signature, or would some lesser\nform of identification than Indiana has required be\nconstitutional?\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, it may well be\npossible that there's certain situations that it could\nrequire it. Each case is a balancing test. As the\nCourt said in Timmons, you have to make hard judgments\non the specific facts of each case and identify both the\nState interest being served, the incremental State\ninterest being served, and the degree of the burdens.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What was the answer to my\nquestion? Is any form of voter identification beyond a\nsignature permissible or not?\nMR. SMITH: If it's readily available and\nnot especially burdensome and there is some reason to\nthink that it is preventing a fraud of some sort,\nserving some --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But clearly you answer all\nof those questions that you've just posed, that you've\njust responded with, \"no\". So then your answer to\nJustice Alito should be no.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, it is true --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Although that leads to the\nnext question, is whether or not there are ways in which\nthe -- the central purpose of this law can be preserved\nbut it could be less stringent. But I'd like you to\nrespond to both of those things.\nMR. SMITH: Well, it is certainly true that,\nin fact, there is no evidence in this record of any\nsignificant amount of fraud that is still occurring with\nthe existing system of voter identification.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That wasn't -- that wasn't\nthe problem I had with your answer to that question.\nYou posed a number of questions to Justice Alito, or a\nnumber of responses, but to each one of those your own\nanswer in the brief was no, and therefore your question\n-- the answer to Justice Alito's question should be no,\nthere is no system that you know of that can impose a\nphoto ID.\nMR. SMITH: I think -- I think that the\ncurrent system works just fine. So if there's any\ndegree of burden being imposed on the voter by some\nadditional identification requirement, then I would say\nit's unconstitutional.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Smith --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your answer is no.\nMR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- suppose at the time of\nregistration there was a photograph taken right in the\nregistration place and on the spot they gave you an ID\nwith that photo, and everybody who registers would get\none and there isn't any question of paying money to get\na birth certificate. Would that be satisfactory? Ir\nthat -- if you could make a photographic ID universally\navailable, you would still have the problem of the\nreligious objectors, but wouldn't everybody else be\ncovered?\nMR. SMITH: If you had a world in which that\nwere true, Your Honor, I think that would be potentially\nconstitutional. That's a very different world than the\none we live in, and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would be\npotentially constitutional?\nMR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So we should\nignore your religious objection argument in this case?\nMR. SMITH: Well, I was assuming that we\nwould make some additional exemptions for particular\npeople with those kinds of problems, if people can't\nhave one. If the question is, if everybody has a photo\nID in their pocket is it constitutional to require them\nto show them at the voting booth, the answer to that I\nthink is yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, do we know that that\nreligious exemption won't be made?\nMR. SMITH: Excuse me, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do we know that that\nreligious exemption won't be made? Nobody's asserted\nit.\nMR. SMITH: No, I'm not -- I'm not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no. I mean in this\ncase. In this case you're claiming there's a problem\nfor people who, for religious reasons, don't want to\nhave their photograph taken. Do we know that if that's\nthe reason that they assert, I can't get the photograph,\nthe State will say you can't vote?\nMR. SMITH: I must be misunderstanding. We\nhave every reason to think that they will let them vote.\nThe only problem with that exemption, like the indigency\nexception, is that it's kind of gratuitively burdensome\nin that you have to go down to the county seat to vote\nevery time; you can't vote in your polling place because\nyou have to fill out this affidavit every time you vote.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you could, you could\ndo it twice. You could make the two trips, one to your\nlocal place and one to the distant place.\nMR. SMITH: Either way, your real voting\nplace is going to be the county clerk's office in the\ncounty seat, forever. That's -- it's not that they\nwon't do it; it's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how far away\nis the furthest county seat for somebody in the county,\nMR. SMITH: I don't know the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: County seats aren't\nvery far for people in Indiana.\nMR. SMITH: No. If you're an indigent\nperson, Your Honor, in Lake County, in Gary, Indiana,\nyou'd have to take the bus 17 miles down to Crown Point\nto vote every time you want to vote. And if you're\nindigent that's a significant burden, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a burden if you're\nnot indigent?\nMR. SMITH: Well, it's -- it's less of a\nburden, Your Honor, considerably less of a burden. You\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 17 miles is 17 miles for\nthe rich and the poor.\nMR. SMITH: -- public transportation,\nbecause the person presumably has no access to an\nautomobile because they don't have a driver's license\nand they're indigent and they're living in Gary,\nIndiana.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have -- the\nrecord shows that fewer than 1 percent of people in\nIndiana don't have a photo ID.\nMR. SMITH: That is not what the record\nshows, Your Honor, and it's not what the district court\nsaid. I think it's -- it would be really a travesty if\nthis Court decided the case on that assumption. What\nthe district court said is if you compare the voting age\npopulation in the census to the total number of driver's\nlicenses and IDs that have been issued, you get that\ndisparity of 43,000 or 1 percent, but what the district\ncourt went on to say is this is probably not accurate\nbecause the total of licenses and IDs includes all the\npeople who have died and left the State and their\nlicenses are still unexpired.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, so do the\nvoting rolls. I thought the district court found 41 --\nMR. SMITH: No, no. The population --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Smith.\nMR. SMITH: So sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- 41.4 percent of\nthe people on the voting rolls in Indiana were either\ndead or they were duplicate entries.\nMR. SMITH: But she wasn't looking at the\nvoting rolls. She was comparing population in the\ncensus as of 2005 with the driver's license records.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you take issue\nwith the 41.4 percent figure for bad entries on the\nvoting registration rolls?\nMR. SMITH: No, I have no reason to -- it\nmay have gotten better now. They apparently have\ninstituted a lot of efforts in the last 3 years to make\nit better, but --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And this is one of\nthem, I suppose, requiring photo ID?\nMR. SMITH: No, I was referring to actually\ncleaning up the voter rolls in compliance with the\nconsent decree they signed with the United States.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, don't you\nthink if you have the voter rolls with a significant\nnumber of bad registrants, either dead or duplicates,\nthat that presents a significant potential for fraud?\nMR. SMITH: I suppose. I don't know if I\ncan say significant. The situation has existed for now\na number of years, and the salient fact here is that\nthere's not a single recorded example of voter\nimpersonation fraud.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because\nit's less of an issue. If somebody wins an election by\n500,000 votes, you may not be terribly worried if some\npercentage were cast by fraud, but you might look to the\nfuture and realize there could be a closer election and\nthere -- it's a type of fraud that, because it's fraud,\nit's hard to detect.\nMR. SMITH: No, it's actually not, Your\nHonor. It's the type of fraud that the Elections\nCommission said -- found is unlikely, the most unlikely,\nbecause it's not that hard to detect. When you're going\ninto the polls and saying, I'm Joe Smith, you're dealing\nwith a neighborhood person who knows a lot of people who\nare there, you have to match that person's signature.\nAnd if that person shows up later on to vote --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the problem with\nthe duplicate entries is there may be two entries for\nJohn Smith because John Smith has moved and the voter\nregistration hasn't been updated. So all you need is\nsomebody else to go in and say: I'm John Smith, this is\nmy address. And later in the day somebody else comes in\nand says: I'm John Smith and this is my address. And\nbecause they're duplicates it's really difficult to\ncheck.\nMR. SMITH: Well, the duplicates,\npresumably, are in two different places, right. So they\nwould vote in two different places.\nBut if -- what the -- the fraudfeasor\ndoesn't know is where the real John Smith is going to\nvote. So if he goes in and votes in one place and says,\nwell, I'm going to -- I expect he's going to go in the\nother place, sooner or later, if you had any significant\namount of this kind of fraud occurring, people would be\ncoming in and saying I can't vote. Somebody says I\nalready voted.\nIt's not happening and, indeed, every single\nindication in this record is that the evidence of this\nkind of fraud occurring, to call it scant is to\noverstate it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The people who are dead or\nhave moved away would certainly not be objecting.\nMR. SMITH: No, Your Honor. I was talking\nabout the disparity between the number of people in the\nvoting-age population and the number of licenses and\nsaying you can't assume it's only a one percent\ndifferential. It's actually more like an eight or nine\npercent differential.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wasn't talking about\nthat. I was talking about whether there is a genuine\nthreat of fraud which the State is moving to eliminate\n--\nMR. SMITH: The question is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and your assertion that,\nyou know, it's not much of a problem because the person\nwhom you're impersonating would find out about it. I\nmean -- but that's certainly not the case for people who\nhave moved away or people, you know, the people in the\ngraveyards that are still on the rolls.\nMR. SMITH: It's certainly possible that\nsomeone could commit this kind of a crime.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'd say likely.\nMR. SMITH: Well, one of the things that\nmakes it less likely is if you try to actually affect an\nelection you need to sway a lot of votes. And in order\nto do that this way you'd have to have 100 or 200 or 500\nco-conspirators, each of them assigned an identity,\nlearning the signature of that person, and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You don't really -- I mean,\nthat's what I wonder if there is no such evidence. How\ncould you get evidence? It used to be common maybe\nurban legends, but of political bosses voting whole\ngraveyards of dead people. All right. Now, that would\nbe almost impossible to catch, I think. Someone walks\nin, saying: I'm Joe Smith. He doesn't say: I'm Joe\nSmith dead. He says, I'm Joe Smith, and he signs\nsomething. And the poll worker looks at it and the\nsignature looks very weird.\nWell, what's the poll worker supposed to do?\nHe's not going to go disrupt the election. And is there\ngoing to be a policeman there to follow this person\nhome? Of course not.\nSo that's their claim. Their claim is that\nwe have a lot of anecdotes and there is a certain kind\nof fraud that you really just can't catch at the poll.\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, what's your response\nto that? Because that's their argument on the other\nside.\nMR. SMITH: First of all, on the point of\nthe anecdotes, I would encourage you to look at the\nBrennan Center brief.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know there are arguments\non both sides. But at the heart of this is what was\nJudge Posner's claim and others that this isn't the kind\nof fraud that you can just dismiss and say it never\nhappens because the person would walk into the poll\nlater and try to vote. What they are talking about is\nwhat Justice Scalia was talking about, and I'm simply\ntrying to focus your answer on that part of the\nquestion.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, many kinds of\nfraud do get caught, and they are no more easily\ndetected than this kind of fraud to be detected. But\nthis kind of fraud is not being caught. No one has been\npunished for this kind of fraud in living memory in this\ncountry. This is not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, they say that's\nbecause you can't catch it.\nMR. SMITH: Well, but Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How would you catch it,\nwhich is my question.\nMR. SMITH: First of all -- first of all,\nyou talk about deterring it. You deter it by the\nsignature match, by having to have the same age, by\nhaving to get past people who know a lot of the people\nin the precinct, and by having very severe criminal\npenalties. And then you have --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If this is not a problem at\nall, how do you account for the fact that the Commission\non Federal Election Reform that was co-chaired by former\nPresident Carter and former Secretary of State Baker\nrecommended a voter ID requirement, and many other\ncountries around the world have voter ID requirements?\nMR. SMITH: What they recommended, Your\nHonor, is exactly what Justice Ginsburg anticipated,\nwhich is get everybody the cards, and then we'll be like\nEurope, and everything will work really fine, and it'll\nactually help the poor to have these IDs for a lot of\nother purposes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As I understand, they\nwere going to have some years in between when their\nproposal was enacted, and they were going to have a\nmobile unit going around to all the neighborhoods, lots\nof advertising, because a premise of that Carter-Baker\nreport was that everybody would easily and costlessly\nget this photo ID.\nMR. SMITH: I would encourage the Court to\nrefer to the Democratic Party Exhibit 18, which is an\narticle by Carter, President Carter, and Secretary\nBaker, following on their report, saying, look, there's\na problem here; that 12 percent of the voting age\npopulation of this country doesn't have a license; we\ndid not recommend this being a mandatory thing until we\nget those licenses in those people's hands.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why would they even\nrequire that if it's not any problem at all? Doesn't it\nat least show that it is a problem of some dimension,\nmaybe not as severe as Indiana claims, but there would\nbe no need for any sort of photo ID problem,\nrequirement, if there were no problem whatsoever. Isn't\nthat true?\nMR. SMITH: Some States don't have signature\nmatches. There may have been a minimal amount of\nadditional benefit in some States from having that\nadded. That was a decision they ultimately made, with\nsome dissents.\nThe reality, though, is if you do it not\ntheir way, but the Indiana way, which is to say you need\nan ID, we're not going to help you get it, in fact we're\ngoing to ratchet up the requirements for making you get\nit, and we're going to charge you money for it, then\nwhat you have is a very different system. Then you have\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They help you get\nit. They say if you don't have an ID we'll give you\none. If you don't have a photo ID, come in and we'll\ngive you one.\nMR. SMITH: But what the record shows is\nthat 60 percent of the time, when people go in and ask\nfor one, they get sent home, because they don't have the\nright documentation because the rules --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What documentation\ndid President Carter and Secretary Baker propose to\nrequire for their photo IDs?\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, I think they were\nvery strong on having this birth certificate\nrequirement, as well. So they -- they were talking\nabout the real ID law and that sort of thing. So I'm\nnot specific about what the report says on that, but\nthey certainly thought there should be -- obviously, in\nthe wake of 9/11 there is some concern about giving out\nthese things too readily. So I'm reasonably sure they\nsupported a birth certificate requirement as well.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if you concede that\nsome kind of voter ID requirement is appropriate, the\nproblem that I have is where you draw the line on a\nrecord like this where there's nothing to quantify in\nany way the extent of the problem or the extent of the\nburden, how many people will actually be prevented from\nvoting or significantly burdened from voting as a result\nof the requirement? How do we tell whether this is on\none side of the line or the other side of the line?\nMR. SMITH: Well, it is a difficult area of\nthe law for you for that reason, Justice Alito. But if\nyou like at Timmons what it says is there's no litmus\ntest, there's no escaping the hard judgments. This is\nthe area where the courts have to be not too deferential\neven though there are hard judgment calls about matters\nof degree, because this is an area where the concern is\nthat the Legislative Branch and the Executive Branch are\ngoing to abuse their power to regulate the electoral\nprocess to find subtle ways to skew the outcome on\nelection day.\nAs John Hard Ely says, this is an area where\njudicial review is the most important, the most\nlegitimate. And so you can't shy away from that even\nthough there are difficult matters of balancing involved\nand --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you're telling us\nthat, you know, we've got to be careful and it's\ndifficult. But Justice Alito's question is: What are\nwe supposed to look at, how are we supposed to do it?\nMR. SMITH: You are supposed to look at how\ndifficult it is to get the ID, what assistance is\nprovided or not being provided, how much it costs.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let's get down -- let's get\ndown to the question of quantification, which is one of\nthe issues that he raised. What's your response to the\nissue that there is no quantification of the actual\nburden measured by the number of voters who are going to\nbe adversely affected? What's the answer to that?\nMR. SMITH: The answer is that there's\nplenty of evidence in the record about the number of\npeople in this country who don't have IDs.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's talk about\nIndiana. What have you got -- what is -- what is your\nbest argument for Indiana?\nMR. SMITH: The best argument for Indiana is\nif you take the district court's 43,000 figure and you\nadjust it for the two factors, death and departure, that\nI mentioned before, the number becomes more like 400,000\npeople in the State of Indiana who lack IDs and are of\nvoting age, eligible -- voting age population people.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And how many of them are\ngoing to suffer from an unreasonable denial of an\nopportunity to get the ID which the State will provide\nthrough the Bureau of Motor Vehicles? How do we\nquantify that?\nMR. SMITH: It is obviously for each person\na different matter of degree. The burdens here are\nalong a whole spectrum because some people don't have a\nbirth certificate, some people have -- don't have a\nbirth certificate, but they have money. Some people\ndon't have a birth certificate and they don't have\nmoney.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I know that. That's\nwhy it's a tough issue. But how do -- how are we going\nto -- how is a court going to arrive at some kind of a\nbottom line judgment on this issue?\nMR. SMITH: Well, because you -- you\nbasically have to take into account all of those\nfactors: How many people are potentially affected; how\ndifficult it is; how similar it is to, say, a poll tax,\nfor example, and say -- and then look at what purpose is\nbeing served here. Is there any real incremental\nbenefit to anything by --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, that's on -- that's\non the other side of the issue.\nMR. SMITH: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But walk -- walk us through\n-- if you were writing the opinion and what you wanted\nto put in the opinion was a reasonable estimate of the\nnumber of people who are going to be substantially\nburdened in having -- who do not now have the\nidentification, substantially burdened in getting it.\nWhat approximate number would you arrive at and how\nwould you -- how would you get to it?\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, I would say of\nthat 400,000 voting age people, probably about half of\nthem are registered voters. It stands to reason that\nmost of them are lower income people, and that\ntherefore, the burden even of having to pay for the\nbirth certificate is a significant one. That -- so that\na very substantial portion of that 200,000 people in\norder --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Smith, is there\nanything in the record about the extent to which the\npolitical parties help people get their IDs, as they\nsometimes drive them to the polls for voting and so\nforth, the part they play in this process?\nMR. SMITH: I'm not aware of anything, Your\nHonor. This is a fairly new law at the time this record\nwas being put together in 2005. But certainly, the\nparties --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it fair to presume\nthat the parties would play a role in helping people get\nregistered and getting to the polls?\nMR. SMITH: But, you know, what there is in\nthe record, Your Honor, is the testimony from the\nLafayette Urban Ministry, which helps the needy in\nLafayette, Indiana. They had 150 people come to them\nand say: We want your help to get IDs. A year later,\nless than 75 had succeeded because they found themselves\ncaught in this Catch-22, where they went to get a birth\ncertificate, they didn't have a driver's license, they\ndidn't have the other kinds of very narrowly specified\nIDs they needed, and so they were basically in this\nbureaucratic maze, and they couldn't get out of it even\nwith the kind of assistance you're imagining, Your\nHonor.\nIf I might reserve the balance of my time\nfor rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Smith.\nMr. Fisher.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. FISHER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThere is no evidence in the record of any\nkind suggesting that 400,000 people in Indiana lack this\nform of identification. The only evidence in the\nrecord --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I take it you accept the\nfigure of, what, about 50,000, to be further discounted\nby those who might vote absentee and so on?\nMR. FISHER: We've never had a problem. In\nfact, that data was submitted by the plaintiffs. It\ncame from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and was matched\nagainst census data.\nI don't think there's ever been any dispute\nabout the accuracy of the record. Now, the judge did\nacknowledge that there might be some outliers one\ndirection or another, but those cannot possibly account\nfor 10 times the number.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I just want to -- I\njust want to know what your figure. Mr. Smith was\nstarting with 400 and then getting it down 2 and so on.\nAnd my recollection in the red brief is that you said,\nall right, let's take the 43,000 figure. I forget what\nyou discounted it for, but it got it down to 25,000.\nSome of those would be able to vote absentee, but\nthis -- I take it you're conceding that, at least\nsubject to some discount, there are probably about\n25,000 people who may be affected by this adversely. Is\nthat clear?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think we would say that\nthat's the number -- that's the number that could\nconceivably be inconvenienced by this law. Now, to put\nthat in perspective, I think you have to compare it, for\nexample, to the number of people who are not registered\nto vote, because there again that's an incidental\nburden. That is something that inconveniences some\npeople.\nAnd we're talking about 35 times more -- in\nterms of a percentage, we're talking about 66.8 percent\nor so of the population that reports being registered to\nvote, far short of the percentage based on the\ncalculations of the district court or anything in the\nballpark of that that don't have photo identification.\nSo we're talking about an infinitesimal portion of the\nelectorate that could even be, conceivably be burdened\nby this.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't that a little\nbit of a stretch, too, when you say \"infinitesimal\"? I\nmean, if you take your two-thirds figure and so on,\nisn't it fair to say that you're probably going to get\ndown to something like 10,000 people or 10,000 plus who\nare going to be affected in the sense that they're going\nto have to scurry around if, if they're going to get the\nappropriate ID?\nMR. FISHER: And at that level, you're\ntalking about less than a half a percent of the total\nelectorate. This is -- this is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But 10 -- isn't the\nconcern over 10,000 voters a sufficiently substantial\nconcern to -- to be considered as something more than\nmerely de minimis and is something that should count in\na facial challenge?\nMR. FISHER: Well, if that's going to be the\ncase, then you're going to have a big problem with voter\nregistration, which is a far bigger problem for more\nvoters. That is a procedure that the Court has long\naccepted, has endorsed multiple times, and yet continues\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we haven't\nendorsed -- I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but we\nhaven't endorsed a registration procedure that would\nrequire as much documentation and as much travel as --\nas the -- as this voter ID procedure would have.\nMR. FISHER: The point I'm making is that if\nwe're going to look at the percent conceivably burdened\nby the law, then voter registration is called into\nquestion. And I don't think that the Democratic Party\nargues against that. I think in their reply brief they\naccepted that that's a possible response.\nNow, it's also terribly significant that we\ndon't have anybody in front of this Court in this case\nwho's injured by this law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And why, why can't the\npeople injured by this law appear themselves and say the\nlaw can't be applied to us? You seem to accept that a\nfacial challenge is appropriate here. Why is -- some\ndifferent kind of a facial challenge. I thought in the\nusual facial challenge you have to show that there is no\nsituation in which the law cannot be constitutionally\napplied.\nMR. FISHER: I agree with that. I don't\nthink that that -- that we take any issue with that\nnotion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Then why are we arguing\nabout whether there is one half of one percent of the\nelectorate who may be adversely affected and as to whom\nit might be unconstitutional? That one half of one\npercent, if and when it is sought to be applied to them,\nhave a cause of action to say you can't apply it to me.\nBut why -- what precedent is there for knocking down\nthis entire law on a facial challenge when I think\neverybody agrees that in the vast majority of cases it\ndoesn't impose a significant hardship?\nMR. FISHER: None. I think that that's\nexactly the point. That's why we argue there's no\nstanding.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You agree that if you're\ngoing to take the -- if this Court takes the Salerno\nstandard, there can never be a facial challenge to a\nregistration requirement, a voter ID requirement. In\nother words, it's not merely that this facial challenge\nwould be knocked out; there never could be one.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I'm not sure that's the\ncase. And if you look back at Marston, the voter\nregistration --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Salerno says unless there\nare no cases, the facial challenge is inappropriate.\nAnd that -- in the real world that will never be true\nwith respect to a -- a voter ID law, will it?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I hope not. But I think\nthat the Court has shown --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It never will be true, will\nit?\nMR. FISHER: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It never be -- if that's\ngoing to be the standard, there will never be a facial\nchallenge.\nMR. FISHER: I'm not sure that that's\nterribly significant, because if you have an as-applied\nchallenge --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There never will be there\none, will there?\nMR. FISHER: As to an as-applied challenge?\nI don't know why not.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, as to a pre-enforcement\nfacial challenge to a law like this.\nMR. FISHER: I think it could be\npre-enforcement and as-applied in a way that could have\nultimately --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but I want you to\nanswer my question.\nMR. FISHER: I'm sorry. Yes, I think that's\ntrue.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We're not going to have\nfacial challenges here, are we?\nMR. FISHER: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does that scare you,\nMr. Fisher, that there can't be a facial challenge?\nMR. FISHER: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, every facial\nchallenge is an immense dictum on the part of this\nCourt, isn't it?\nMR. FISHER: I think that's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This Court is sitting back\nand looking at the ceiling and saying, oh, we can\nenvision not the case before us, but other cases. Maybe\nit's one half of one percent or maybe it's 45 percent,\nwho knows. But we can imagine cases in which this law\ncould be unconstitutional, and therefore, the whole law\nis unconstitutional. That's not ordinarily the way\ncourts behave, is it?\nMR. FISHER: I should hope not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, we've done that in the\nFirst Amendment area.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That is not the case that\nyou are confronting.\nMR. FISHER: That's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean, the reason they\nare bringing a facial challenge is because the horse is\ngoing to be out of the barn. They will have the\nelection, and just what they are afraid of could happen,\nthat the result will be skewed in favor of the opposite\nparty, because there are people who have not been able\nto vote. So, if you're going to talk about what is the\nimpact of this, they are in this bind after the\nelection -- well -- they've always -- already lost that\none.\nNow, there is something in the briefs that\nhappened after this case was instituted, but we know\nfrom Marion County that there were 34 people who were\nnot able to have a vote counted. And of those 34, only\ntwo ended up qualifying after the fact. So, we know\nthat in that one particular county, most of the people\nwho were unable to satisfy the requirement initially\nended up not satisfying it.\nIs that -- I mean that's not hypothetical.\nThat's real. But it does give you some confirmation\nthat it isn't mere speculation that there are going to\nbe many people who will not -- whose vote will not\ncount.\nMR. FISHER: With respect, Your Honor, for\nall we know, those may have been fraudulent ballots. It\nmay well be the case that all 32 did not show up to\nvalidate their votes are fraudulent.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's the same board that\nsaid in all our experience, in all of our memory, there\nhas never been an impersonator.\nMR. FISHER: And that goes back to how we\nwould know, because without an ID check, it's impossible\nto detect this kind of fraud.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if you're worried\nabout fraud --\nMR. FISHER: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you're worried about\nfraud, what I don't understand, and I'd like to track it\nthrough with you, is the registration system. As I read\nthe Indiana voter registration application, all a person\nhas to do to register is to write in, enclose a utility\nbill that has his name and address, and if he doesn't\nhave a photo ID, he can write the four numbers of his\nSocial Security; and if he doesn't have that either he\ndoesn't have to do anything, and they will give him a\nnumber -- and you mail it in. And you're registered.\nSo all a person who have to do if he wants\nto be fraudulent is make out a fraud one of those, and\nhe has a photo ID; he can go to the polls. So my\nquestion to you is this: given that system of\nregistration, focusing on the issue before us, why don't\nyou just say and we'll give to you -- you put on -- if\nyou don't have a photo ID, we'll give you one. Now\nthere it would not stand as an obstacle; that apparently\nis what Georgia has done. And it doesn't require people\nto go out and spend $10 or $5 or something digging up\ntheir birth certificate, which if you tried to do, is\nquite a job for many people.\nAnd therefore, you'd have all the things you\nwant. All you would do is with the 43,000 people who\ndon't have the IDs, you'd say we'll get you one. No big\ndeal. You have a photo machine there when they come in\nto register; they have to go down; you take a picture of\nthem and you hand it to them. And I would think that\nthat less restrictive way would satisfy your anti-fraud\ninterests far better than the way you've chosen, but I\nleave my judgment out of it. I just would like you to\ntalk through why that isn't a less restrictive way,\nwhich is far better in achieving your anti-fraud\ninterests, or at least as good.\nMR. FISHER: Well, because I think we want\nto have an idea that has some integrity to it. I mean,\nthis is a balancing test that the legislature itself\nwent through, which is to say they wanted to adopt a\nform of identification that might be effective and has\nbeen proven effective and has been accepted the world\nover as the standard form of identification. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: We are going to give -- all\nwe are doing is, we will give you the photo. It has\nnothing to do with validity. That photo proves that\nMr. Smith who comes in and asks for it is the same\nMr. Smith who registered to vote. And that's all your\nsystem does in the first place. So what is the answer\nto that?\nMR. FISHER: I think again that we, on the\nfront end part of it is we are hamstrung on how we can\nregulate voter registration, in part by the National\nVoter Registration Act. Let me just make that part of\nit clear.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not arguing about that.\nI'm saying your whole -- I'll repeat it once more. I'm\nsaying your whole system is a system designed to assure\nthat the person at the voting booth is the same as the\nperson who registers. I accept that, absolutely right.\nAnd I'm simply saying given that, why didn't you say\nMr. Proto -- Mr. Likely, like to register: \"Come in.\nIf you don't have a photo ID, we will give you one.\"\nNow, what's the objection to that?\nMR. FISHER: I think in part it's the\nadministrative apparatus. I mean, we are buying into --\nright now into a system that already exists, and in fact\nwith voter registration at the DMV as it's required, in\nmany ways that is what you have. You go to the DMV\nanyway for other things.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose you -- you have\nyour photograph taken when you register. You're really\nan out of state person, you go in and register, you make\nup an address, you come in, you have your photograph\ntaken; it proves that you were the person that\nregisters. It doesn't prove that you were the person\nthat lives at that address, or that you are of such and\nsuch an age and whatnot, which the -- the means of\nidentification that you require would show, wouldn't it?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you don't -- you don't\nhave the photo identification required at registration,\ndo you?\nMR. FISHER: No, we don't. That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can't, can you?\nMR. FISHER: I think there are problems with\nthat. That -- that was a different battle --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And even so is, there\nanything that prohibits the State from confirming the\nvalidity of the registration at the polling place?\nMR. FISHER: No. I think that's the main\npoint here, which is it's at that point where the ballot\nis being cast, which is where we want identification,\nand where we want to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why wouldn't you have the\nsame from in being sure the registration is correct? I\ndon't understand that.\nMR. FISHER: Well, we -- well, I think we\nmay very well, but I think the policy --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why wouldn't you require\nphoto ID then?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think the policy struck\nnationally, under the motor voter, is to have an easy\nregistration system, so that it may be problematic to\nintroduce additional limits.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is it the policy to have\nit tougher to vote than to register? That doesn't make\nsense to me.\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think the theory is\neasy --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The national policy it to\nmake it both easy to register and easy to vote.\nMR. FISHER: Well, and tough to cheat,\nhopefully, is the backside of that, which is what the\nidea is trying to do.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Fisher, you make\n-- rely on the argument that 40 percent of the\nregistrants -- or not registrants, the people on the --\nyes, registrants -- on the voter list are -- are not\naccurate. That argument is a little difficult to -- to\ntake because what you're saying is we do such a lousy\njob on registration that we should be able to do a --\nhave a more stringent voting requirement. Why do you do\nsuch a lousy job on registration?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think that -- that part\nof the responsibility there does lie again with the\nNational Voter Registration Act which limits how we may\nmaintain those lists. The problem has grown since --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you were\nsued by the Federal Government because you did such a\nbad job.\nMR. FISHER: There may be -- there's part of\nit is the responsibility on our end, but part of it is\nalso the -- the hoops we have to jump through pursuant\nto the National Voter Registration Act, and we've got a\nsituation unfortunately where with inflated voter lists,\nwith reports of fraud around the country, the General\nAssembly is generally concerned about voter confidence\nand the legitimacy of elections, and that's precisely\nwhat this law is trying to target. Trying to reassure\nvoters --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does Indiana stack up\nagainst other States in the inflation of the voter\nrolls?\nMR. FISHER: We are among the most inflated.\nI can't give you precise ranking but the expert that we\nbrought forward said we are among the most inflated.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you are under a\nconsent decree to do something about that?\nMR. FISHER: That's right, and we are taking\nthose steps. Now I think it's important to bear in mind\nthat -- that the parties to the consent decree at the\nState level, while they can't identify individuals who\nhave -- have dormant registrations, and they can send\nthose names, names that can be canceled to the local\nauthorities, the local authorities are under no -- no\nresponsibility under the consent decree or otherwise to\n-- to cancel those. And in fact the expert report that\nwe had indicated that there were a number -- in 1998, I\nthink -- a number of duplicates and decedent\nregistrations that were sent to the local authorities,\nonly 30 percent of which were canceled.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, are you making the\nargument that you can place a heavier burden on voters\nto identify themselves because your State officials\nrefuse to follow the law?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think it's part of it,\nis --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I think that's the argument\nyou were just making.\nMR. FISHER: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Even when we identify the\nduplicates, the local officials are still leaving them\nin the polls. I mean, surely you're not going to rest\nyour case on that, are you?\nMR. FISHER: Well, I think the larger point\nis that when we've got a situation where there is an\nobvious gap in security at the polls, where the public\nexpects to show ID -- and -- as they would in any\nordinary, everyday situation -- that is going to create\na lack of confidence, particularly when combined with\nwhat we have ended up with.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you're still making the\nargument that there's a lack of confidence because our\nlocal officials won't cull the rolls of dead voters.\nMR. FISHER: Not explicitly. That is true;\nthat's part of the argument, but the other part is that\nthere is a reasonable and obvious step to take to ensure\nthat there is no fraud at the polls.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe there is a\nreasonable, obvious step you can take to make your\nofficials obey the law when you tell them how to do it.\nMR. FISHER: Well, we are limited even at\nthat by the NVRA.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Now wait a minute. Are you\ntelling me that you are limited by some Federal statute\nfrom preventing local officials -- I'm sorry, from\nforcing local officials to take the action to cull the\nrolls of dead voters, when you have identified those\ndead voters for them?\nMR. FISHER: No, I'm not saying that, but I\nam saying --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- then it's Indiana's\nresponsibility to cull those rolls. Right?\nMR. FISHER: Consistent with the NVRA, yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's not a legitimate\nargument to say we can put a heavier burden on\nidentifying -- on voters to identify themselves because\nour officials are being contumacious. You don't rest on\nthat argument?\nMR. FISHER: No, not at all.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, good. I thought you\nwere.\nMR. FISHER: No, that's not my theory. But\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One aspect of your system\n-- I know your time is about to expire -- but it seems\nto me that every indigent person in -- who doesn't have\na photo ID is put to a burden that the mass of voters\nare not put to -- that is either the two-step process\nand not going to my local precinct, but having to go to\nthe county courthouse. That burden is on every indigent\nperson who doesn't have a photo ID, so we are not\nspeculating about numbers. That would be true for every\nindigent person who doesn't have photo ID, right?\nMR. FISHER: Who -- right, and who would\nhave to pay a fee to get -- to get the ID.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And for nonindigent people.\nI mean, there may be --\nMR. FISHER: Well, that's right. Anybody\nwho --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Some very well-to-do\nelderly, you don't drive, and they are in the same\nposition.\nMR. FISHER: Well, and who can also vote\nabsentee without ID. But anybody who forgets their\nidentification on election day, for example, would have\nto go through the same process, where they would cast a\nprovisional ballot and then have to return to the clerk\nwith in 10 days.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they can go home\nand get the identification and go back to their\nprecinct; that's what the indigent can't do.\nMR. FISHER: Or a nonindigent person who\ndoesn't have ID but then needs to go to the DMV.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we thought that the\nbirth certificate requirement for indigent people was --\nwas burdensome, are there any States that have\nalternates to birth certificates? Do neighbors come in\nand testify that this is the person? And I was going to\nask the Petitioners' counsel if there's some areas where\nthis statute -- where the central purpose and the\ncentral function of this statute can be preserved but\nthere can be some reasonable alternatives for people who\nhave difficulty?\nMR. FISHER: Well, let me do point out one\ncategory where there are some reasonable alternatives.\nWith respect -- in Indiana -- with respect to the\nelderly who can swear that they were never issued a\nbirth certificate, there is an alternate means of\nidentification, but that's the only category.\nThe other thing we run into is the REAL ID\nAct. If Indiana wants to have an identification card\nthat can be acceptable in Federal facilities, it's going\nto have to have minimal criteria for issuing those photo\nidentifications. And so I think with respect to that,\nit would not be permissible to get around a birth\ncertificate, which is kind of a foundational document.\nI mean there are alternatives, such as a passport, but I\ndon't -- you know, I don't mean to suggest that that's\nnecessarily going to be easier than it is to get a birth\ncertificate. It's just that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you need a birth\ncertificate to get a passport?\nMR. FISHER: Well, that's what I mean.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. So maybe that's\nunconstitutional too.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FISHER: Yes. And it -- it's worth\nbearing in mind that this form of identification is\nnecessary to do so many everyday activities, and it's\nnot as if the State of Indiana went out and created an\nentirely new system to impose on the entire electorate,\nthat everybody would have to start from square one. The\nvast majority of voters are already in compliance with\nthis law, and the decision of the General Assembly, that\nit is a reasonable step to take for a measure of\nelection security to bring the State's voting system\ninto the 21st century and to require the same photo\nidentification that you have to show typically to get on\nan airplane, to get into many Federal courthouses, is a\nreasonable step in the right direction to preserve voter\nconfidence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Fisher.\nMR. FISHER: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nAny system of voting that involves\nregistrations or precincts will necessarily require some\nmechanism for ascertaining a voter's identity.\nAccordingly Petitioners cannot take issue that the\nconstitutionality of some mechanism for ascertaining\nvoter ID. And I take it from today's argument that they\nwould concede the constitutionality of a signature match\nrequirement. Likewise, nobody can really dispute the\nproposition that a government-issued photo ID is an\nawfully good way of verifying someone's identity.\nSo the dispute really boils down to, in a\nsystem where the States can legitimately ask for some\nkind of basis to ascertain ID, can they insist on a\nparticularly good one, the photo ID? And we would\nsuggest that there's nothing in the First or Fourteenth\nAmendments that precludes that from happening.\nNow, with respect to the nature of this\nchallenge, I think one thing that's very evident from\nthe questions is this was a challenge that was brought\nto the statute on its face and was brought before there\nwas any enforcement of the statute or any significant\nenforcement of the statute. Now, I would respectfully\nsuggest that there's a better way to test the\nconstitutionality of these statutes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you do that,\nGeneral Clement, I'd like to you to concentrate on the\none group of people where I think you can make a facial\nchallenge and may not all speculating, and that's the\nindigent people who can't get -- don't have the photo\nID. They don't drive, and they can't get up the money\nto get the birth certificate or whatever else. They do\nhave a burden that, it seems to me, the State could\neasily eliminate if they want those people to vote, and\nthat is to say okay, do the affidavit, the whole thing\nin your local precinct; we'll make it easy for you and\nnot send you away, send you off to the county courthouse\nto get it validated. Why -- why, if you really wanted\npeople to vote, wouldn't you do it that way?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I\nmean I can understand that you're concerned with that\naspect of the statute and the fact that you can't\nexecute an indigency affidavit in the polling place. I\ndon't know why that's a basis for a facial challenge\nthough. In particular, I think if you look at the\nPlaintiffs, the individual members, if they are members\nof the Indiana party that have been identified, they've\ncertainly identified people who do not have the ID\ncurrently. I'm not sure that they were specific as to\nwhether they were indigent or not. I'm not sure the\nindividuals, the nine individuals, were really parsed\nout that way. And I would think the far better way to\ngo about dealing with that issue is to take as a\nstarting point -- I mean you pointed out that there were\n32 provisional ballots cast in the Marion County\nelection. Now, I gather from the State that's something\nlike 0.02 percent of the ballots cast. So it suggests\nthat this is not a monumental problem, but those 32\nprovisional ballots seem to me to be 32 possible\nplaintiffs with a much more concrete case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I'm --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- than anything we have\nbefore us.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Just on -- just on that\none class of people.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Sure.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's not going to\nchange after the election. I mean here is a group of\npeople who are being put to a burden of going someplace\nelse. And my only question is, why couldn't the system\nmake it easy for them if we really want to help America\nto vote, all Americans, and say we'll do it in the local\nprecinct, somebody will be there to help you fill out\nthe affidavit, instead of doing it in a way that's\nreally going to discourage people from voting?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And, Justice Ginsburg, I\nmean I see your concern, and I think if we had an\nas-applied challenge that wasn't this kind of grab bag\nchallenge that looks at all the various different\nclasses of people that might be adversely affected, if\nwe had a challenge that focused on that particular\nissue, I would imagine -- I don't know for sure -- I\nwould imagine that the State would probably put on some\nevidence that says, look, there's a reason we did it\nthat way; we piggybacked on the general provisional\nballot provisions and what we decided is that, if we had\npeople executing indigency affidavits at the polling\nplace, it would add to the lines as the the polls.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They didn't make that\nargument now. I mean we don't have to wait until after\nan election to hear that, any more than we have to wait\nuntil after an election to identify the voters that\nJustice Ginsburg has.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But with respect, Justice\nSouter, I mean that's not the way this challenge\nproceeded. I mean there was a challenge to everything\nunder the sun, to the whole sort of -- this statute ab\ninitio, and it wasn't something that really put the\nState on notice that that was the nub of the dispute and\nwould put evidence in the record that might join the\nissue.\nAnd again I would say, of course, if there\nwere that kind of as-applied challenge, one of the\nvirtues of it would be that the remedy at the end of the\nday would not be to strike the statute down on its face,\nbut it would be an injunction consistent with the\nteaching of this Court in Nayot that said, look, you\nneed to have -- you need to be enjoined to offer the\naffidavits at the polling place --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That would be a --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- because --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That would be a virtue, but\none of the vices would be that it would be after the\nelection and the entire matter would be academic for\nanother 2 years, until another 2 years had passed.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't think so. I\nmean, at this point, like I said -- I mean we have these\n32 potential plaintiffs.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The provisional ballots\nwould be counted, I assume.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: What's that?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The provisional ballots\nwould be counted. The ones that were unconstitutionally\nprevented from voting -- those claims would be counted.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, if the claim could\nbe brought in sufficient time, I suppose it would.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if we assume that\neveryone who has a decent claim under this Act went\nthrough the hoops to get the provisional ballot at the\n-- wherever the county office is and --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Sure.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- that's an assumption\nwhich need not necessarily be made.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But, conversely, nowhere\nis it -- nowhere is it a rational assumption that all 32\nof these individuals has a great claim. It may be that\nsome of them are people who just forgot their ID --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I'm not\nconcentrating --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- and for those people I\ndon't think they have much of a claim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I was trying to deal with\nthis one category of person, and the State -- it was\naddressed, and the State said, well, we can't do it that\nway because that will lead to congestion at the polling\nplace. But it seems to me that that is powerfully hard\nto reconcile with the claim that there are so few of\nthese people it's not really a problem. If there are so\nfew of them, then I don't understand why they should be\nput to the burden of going someplace other than the\npolling place.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I\nmean I think there's a rationale justification for that\nwhich is that, you know, if -- especially if there are\nonly a handful of these people, is do you really want to\ninstruct every poll worker at every precinct on how to\ndeal with this unusual situation or do you want to say,\nyou know, that's sort of an outlying situation, let's\ninstruct one poll worker at the county elections office\nhow to deal with it?\nNow, at the end of the day, you may not be\npersuaded that that's the way to do it. I think that's\na reasonable argument, but an as-applied challenge could\nfocus like a laser beam on those particular voters and\nthose challenges. You could have particular indigent\nvoters in front of you.\nAnd it seems to me that that's the\npreferable way to adjudicate this kind of claims, and I\nthink what this Court could do is this Court could\nreject the facial challenge that is before it here that\nleave open the possibility of that as-applied challenge,\nor one could certainly imagine a veteran who has a\nFederal photo ID without an expiration date who comes\ninto court and says, look, it's irrational to make me go\nget a different form of ID. That as-applied challenge\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we did that, I assume\nchallenges could be made in advance of the election.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't see any reason why\nthey couldn't be. I mean it might depend a little bit\non the nature of the challenge.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And presumably the\nchallenges could be adjudicated. You have 10 days to go\ndown to the courthouse when you file a provisional\nballot, and if it turns out the election was decided by\nthree votes and there are 30 provisional ballots,\npresumably the challenge can be brought at that point as\nwell.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That is true, and there is\na provision for judicial review under Indiana law, of\nthe provisional ballots, if there's an ongoing dispute.\nBut I also take the point that some of this could be\ntaken care of well in advance of the election, which is\nactually, I think, a very healthy way to deal with\nelection disputes. And so my hypothetical veteran with\nthe card, he has got the card in his wallet right now,\nor her wallet right now. They can go get --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is it not unrealistic to\nassume it would be easier to file a lawsuit and go off\nwith the burden of litigation rather than go back to get\nthe second affidavit? If you're challenging two\naffidavits, you know, to have a Federal case over it\nseems a little bit improbable.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: You know, it may be,\nJustice Stevens, that it's easier to get somebody to\nhelp you out with the Federal case than it is with the\nsecond -- with the second affidavit. I don't know. I\nmean, you know, I think if you look around where there\nhave been these laws --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Things called class\nactions, right?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Yes. I think, if you look\nwhere there have been these laws, there have been -- the\none observed phenomenon definitely is litigation.\nSo I do think that these claims will be\nbrought. I just really think that in choosing the mode\nof litigation, you know, Justice Kennedy for the Court\nin the partial-birth case said that as-applied\nchallenges are the basic building block of adjudication.\nAnd this seems like a particularly\nappropriate case to apply that lesson, because I can\nimagine there --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think there\nis standing in this case to bring the facial challenge?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think it's a close\nquestion, Mr. Chief Justice. I would say that I think\nthere is standing. I think the standing that exists\nhere is the standing to represent the nine or so\nindividuals that are addressed specifically on pages 49a\nand 51a of the district court opinion. Those are\nindividuals who do not have photo IDs.\nI think that as to the membership issue,\nboy, if the Indiana Democratic Party has any members,\nits probably these individuals, because they are poll\nworkers and active in the parties.\nAnd what I would say about those\nindividuals, though, is that it is telling that the only\nindividuals they have been able to identify who don't\nhave photo IDs also happen to be elderly individuals who\ncan, by right, vote by absentee ballot.\nNow, that's not to say -- and I would -- I\nwould concede there is a legally protected interest in\nvoting in person sufficient to cross the Article III\nthreshold. But I think, when you are looking for the\nreal world impact, it is telling that the people they\nhave been able to identify do have a ready mechanism\navailable to them.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If you look at the real\nworld impact and you ask whether the Democratic Party\nhas standing to challenge the law, is it relevant that\nthe State legislature is split entirely on party lines?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: May I answer the question?\nYou know, I don't think that's relevant in this -- I\nwould hate to think that a party line vote would\nnecessarily give the other party standing as a general\nrule.\nI don't think that you would adopt that, and\nthis goes out of the record, of course, to a recent\nstudy. But the one study that's been done actually\nshows that the Democratic Party did well in the 2006\nelections, and turnout went up a little bit.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But don't you think it's\nfair to infer that this law does have an adverse impact\non the Democrats that is different from its impact on\nthe Republicans?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, again, if I could\nanswer, I mean I would just say that, you know, if this\nwas a cleverly designed mechanism by the Republican\nParty to disadvantage the Democratic Party, at least in\n2006 it looks like it went pretty far awry from their\nperspective.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General\nClement. Mr. Smith, three minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SMITH: Thank you, Your Honor.\nLet me start by addressing the question of\nwhat reasonable alternatives there are to the strict law\nthat we are dealing with here. This is the most strict\nlaw in the country. And what you have when you look at\nthe range of laws that are out there in other States is\na very different set of responses that occur when a\nvoter shows up without an ID in hand.\nIn Michigan and several other States, for\nexample, the response is to say: All right, we are\ngoing to make you fill out an affidavit attesting to who\nyou are, and that you are a registered voter; that you\nlive in this precinct; and we'll let you go ahead and\nvote a regular ballot.\nThat in those States they -- they consider\nthat a sufficient safeguard while looking at the IDs of\nall the people who have the IDs.\nIn Florida they have a different approach,\nwhich is to let you vote a provisional ballot, and then\nwhat they do is they judge your signature match later on\nin exactly the same process that's used for absentee\nballots.\nWe have a lot of information in this record\nabout why it's okay to have absentee ballots allowed\nwithout an ID in Indiana, and they say, well, we have\nthese specialized committees that know how to do\nsignature matches; and they are trained; and so we get\nthousands of these absentee ballots in. But we can very\ncarefully scrutinize them.\nYou could do very easily do exactly the same\nthing with respect to the provisional ballots cast by\npeople who show up without their ID without --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who do you do with\nilliterates who don't have a signature? Do you match\n\"Xs,\" or what?\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Aren't there going to be\nproblems under any system you imagine?\nMR. SMITH: Yes, there are; and it's this\nCourt's job under the Burdick line of cases to weigh the\nbenefits and the burdens and come out with the\nappropriate decision about whether the legislature went\ntoo hard -- far.\nLet me talk a little bit about this facial\nversus as-applied approach. To paraphrase King Lear:\nThat way lies madness, Your Honor. This Court has never\nlooked at these issues on an as-applied basis.\nThe Burdick test, in its very nature, is\nabout facial weighing of systemic benefits and burdens\nfrom the particular rule. And there is a reason for\nthat, because the concern is systemic; that the burdens\nthat are being imposed, a whole range of them depending\non the kind of people involved and their particular\ncircumstances, will have an effect on the outcome of the\nelection overall.\nImagine, if you will, what it would be like\nto try to have all these class actions being brought,\nsome by the people who don't have IDs, some by the\npeople who have IDs but don't have enough money. You\nwould have to figure out exactly how much money people\nare allowed to have in order to be in this exempt class.\nThe courts would then be creating exempt\nclasses, trying to decide whether the legislature would\nhave wanted an exemption drawn or not. The whole thing\nwould be a complete and utter morass. And, ultimately,\neven if you did carve out an exception for indigent\npeople or for some other group of people, you ultimately\nwould leave untouched the real problem, which is the\nconcern that even for people who are relatively --\nsuffer relatively minor inconvenience, maybe one percent\nof them are not going to show up and vote.\nAnd that's exactly what the legislature may\nhave been trying to accomplish here. So that is not the\nway the jurisprudence in this area ever looks at it.\nNobody applied the poll -- nobody challenged the poll\ntax as-applied.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to invalidate\na statute on the ground that it's a minor inconvenience\nto a small percentage of voters?\nMR. SMITH: That it imposes a range of\nburdens on people from quite severe to less severe, and\nthose burdens vastly outweigh the -- any incremental\nstate interest that is being served, Your Honor.\nThat's our -- our analysis, and I think it's\ncertainly completely consistent with every decision\nright up through Klingman a couple of years ago. That's\nthe test that this Court applies.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You said it serves\nno purpose. What if we determine that it does serve a\npurpose in preventing fraud. How are we supposed to\nweigh that against your asserted burden on the right to\nvote?\nMR. SMITH: Well, you have to make some\njudgment about the incremental, additional benefit above\nwhat's already been in place for decades, and it worked\nextremely effectively, Your Honor. And, obviously, you\ndo the balancing. I'm just the advocate here. But it\nseems to me you have to say is there any real benefit\nhere compared to these burdens?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if you want to talk\nabout increments, why shouldn't we also ask whether our\njudgment does more harm than good; whether -- whether\nthe remedy for -- for the inconvenience to a small\nnumber of people is to wash away the whole statute,\nwhich in most of its applications is perfectly okay?\nWhy don't we do that weighing of benefits and burdens of\nincrements versus needs?\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, I think the\nnumber of people who are adversely affected is part of\nthe analysis. But if you come in and you come to the\nconclusion that there is essentially no real,\nsignificant benefit from making all of these other\npeople who have IDs show them, then the balance comes\nout that you throw the law out. That's the way the\nanalysis works.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
