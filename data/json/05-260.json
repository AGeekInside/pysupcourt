        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical\nServices.\nMr. Stris.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. STRIS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe question presented today is whether a\nclaim for contractual reimbursement is cognizable under\nsection 502(a)(3) of ERISA.\nIn this case, MAMSI, the fiduciary of an\nERISA plan, seeks monetary reimbursement from the\nSereboffs, two beneficiaries of the plan. MAMSI has\nconsistently taken the position that its money claim is\ngoverned exclusively by the terms of its contract with\nthe Sereboffs. This contract expressly disclaims and\nreplaces most equitable principles. At its core,\nMAMSI's claim is nothing more than a request for money\ndamages. This claim is not cognizable under ERISA\nbecause MAMSI is not entitled to any relief that was\ntypically available at equity.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you this? If the\n-- if the day before the settlement was consummated,\nthe plan had gone into court and had said the -- the\nbeneficiaries plan to settle the case and they've\nindicated that they're not going to give us any of the\nsettlement in accordance with the terms of the contract\nand we want an injunction preventing their distribution\nto anyone but -- but us, if the -- if the judge\nbelieved that and believed that under the contract, the\nplan was entitled to reimbursement, could the judge\nhave enjoined the -- the distribution of the funds to\nthe -- you know, to the extent of the plan's claim?\nMR. STRIS: Well, what I would say, Justice\nSouter, is that an injunction to -- merely to prohibit\ndistribution would be equitable relief.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. STRIS: That doesn't necessarily mean,\nhowever, that once that injunction issued, the plan\ncould enforce the terms of the contract under ERISA.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it could enforce the\ninjunction.\nMR. STRIS: It could enforce the injunction\nprovided that -- that the injunction was not a\nmandatory injunction. This Court in Great-West clearly\nheld that a mandatory injunction under 502(a)(3),\nsaying pay us this money that's due under the contract,\nis not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that -- that was --\nthat was an ex post remedy and there were no\nidentifiable funds. What we're talking about here is\nan ex ante injunction and the funds are identifiable.\nAnd you are telling me that, in fact, all the -- all\nthe equity court could have said was, don't pay\nyourself?\nMR. STRIS: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It could not have said, give\nthe $75,000, or whatever it is, to the plan?\nMR. STRIS: I -- I would say two things,\nJustice Souter. The first is that, respectfully, I\ndon't think Great-West made the distinction that a\nmandatory injunction was impermissible because it was\nex post. I think Great-West squarely held that a\nmandatory injunction is just a clever attempt by\nlawyers to enforce a contract for legal damages.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, when we get down to\nclever attempts, aren't we at the clever attempt point\nwhen -- when you say that they can enjoin the\ndistribution to anybody else, including themselves, but\nthey can't tell them to pay the money to -- to Great-\nWest? I mean, isn't that the point at which we get to\nsilliness?\nMR. STRIS: I don't -- I don't think that's\ntrue, Your Honor, because we do not take the position\nthat MAMSI or an ERISA plan doesn't have alternative\nremedies. Of course, there -- that -- that should --\nthat consideration should be irrelevant because either\nthe claim is legal or equitable, and there are many\nclaims that beneficiaries have for the violation of a\nplan term that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you -- in any case, I\ndon't want to prolong this unduly. You're saying that\nthere would have been some equitable claim and some\nequitable remedy with respect to the $75,000 that --\nthat a -- a court could have taken cognizance of the\nday before the settlement.\nMR. STRIS: Oh, to be clear, Your Honor, I\nwill suggest a few remedies that I think might be\navailable here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. I'm -- I'm just trying\nto characterize your answer to me. You said, yes, that\nwould be an injunction and it would be an injunction\ntypical of what courts of equity issue.\nMR. STRIS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I don't understand.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- an injunction\npending litigation? Is that the idea just until you\nresolve whatever claim it is they have to -- to the\nmoney, determine it. It may be a legal claim, an\nequitable claim, but until you sort it out, you can\nget an injunction to prevent them from dissipating\nthe -- the claimed funds.\nMR. STRIS: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and that's extremely important because we\nwould suggest --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- I still don't\nunderstand. If I'm the -- the trial judge and you ask\n-- and I'm asked to enter an injunction, I enter an\ninjunction knowing that in the end it's going to be to\nno purpose? I have to -- I have to be enforcing some\nultimate injury of -- of which the plaintiff has\nstanding to assert.\nMR. STRIS: That's a fair point, Justice\nKennedy, but that doesn't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So that's why I don't\nunderstand your questions. I would think you'd say no\ninjunction because, at the end of the day, it amounts\nto nothing.\nMR. STRIS: See, I don't think that's true,\nthough, because there's a distinction I'd like to draw\nbetween having a remedy under 502(a)(3) of ERISA and\nhaving a remedy at all. We would suggest that the plan\ncan intervene in the State court suit. We would\nsuggest that the plan could write a letter to the\ntortfeasor notifying the tortfeasor that it has a\nsubrogation right, and if the tortfeasor entered into a\nrelease, it wouldn't be viable. So there may be good\nreason for the Federal court to enter the injunction\nthat you suggested, Mr. Chief Justice, merely to\nprevent the dissipation of the funds because the funds\nmight need to be preserved for a separate purpose.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stris, I'd -- I'd like\nto know what -- what you make of our opinion in Barnes\nv. Alexander. It's an old case but it involved a\nsituation similar to this, namely, a contingent fee\narrangement with a lawyer, and the client received all\nthe money, without giving the lawyer his contingent\nfee. We reasoned in our opinion that, quote, the\ncontract for a contingent fee out of a fund awarded\nconstituted a lien upon the fund and that, quote, it is\none of the familiar rules in equity that a contract to\nconvey a specific object, even before it is acquired,\nwill make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets\ntitle to the thing. Why doesn't that absolutely\nresolve the present case?\nMR. STRIS: That does not resolve the present\ncase, Justice Scalia, because the -- MAMSI's\ninterpretation of the Barnes line of cases, the\nequitable lien by assignment cases, would entirely\nnegate the limitation that Congress put into 502(a)(3).\nAnd -- and if you'd permit me to explain why.\nA remedy of an equitable lien by assignment,\nas we explained in our opening brief, is not a\nrestitutionary remedy. No unjust enrichment need be\nproved. No tracing need be proved. It's purely a\ncontractual remedy.\nNow, as a result, courts of equity\nhistorically developed this remedy to give priority to\none creditor over another if there was a present intent\non the part of the promisor to pledge that specific\nproperty as security.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But we -- but, you know, our\nopinions haven't said only certain kinds of equitable\nrelief, only restitutionary equitable relief. We've\nsimply said whether equitable relief would normally be\navailable. And now you're -- you're trying to rewrite\nour cases to say that only certain types of equitable\nrelief are -- are available.\nMR. STRIS: I don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and if, indeed, it\ndoes -- it does occupy a lot of the field, so be it.\nThat's the way Congress wrote the statute.\nMR. STRIS: Yes, that's fair, Your Honor, but\nthat's not what I'm saying. I would -- I would direct\nthe Court's attention to -- to page 211 of the Great-\nWest opinion, note 1, where the Court wrote that any\nequitable remedy under 502(a)(3) must -- and I quote --\nbe deemed to contain the limitations upon its\navailability that equity typically imposes. And my\nonly point --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what about --\nMR. STRIS: -- my only --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- what about if you're --\nif you're using Great-West, it seemed to me the most\nrelevant point made in Great-West was that the plan\ncould seek restitution in equity where money identified\nas belonging in good conscience to the plan could\nclearly be traced to particular funds in -- in the\ndefendant's possession. The problem in Great-West was\nthe money had already been dissipated. It had been set\naside.\nMR. STRIS: That -- that's true, Justice\nGinsburg, and -- and it -- it proves my point more than\nrefutes it, and here's why. Great-West had no -- this\nCourt in Great-West had no occasion to explain when\nsomething was traceable or when it belonged in good\nconscience to the plan. It merely said that you look\nto history for those requirements.\nAnd this is why, Justice Scalia, I\ndistinguish between equitable restitution and an\nequitable lien by assignment. They were both typically\navailable in equity as narrow exceptions to getting\nmoney for breach of contract. I concede that. But\nthey had very different requirements, neither of which\ncan be met in this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose in the 18th century\n-- I'm not an expert in this. You're more of one. But\nsuppose you had an absolute classical trust. It's the\n-- it's a trust for the benefit of the fifth grandchild\nof the Duke of Hamilton. All right?\nMR. STRIS: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The trustee. And this\ntrustee, going to the fifth grandchild one day, lends\nhim 1,000 pounds, and he takes his security. The\ngrandchild says, 4 years from now my great, great Aunt\nMargaret is likely to die and she's going to leave me\nmy ring -- her ring. And the -- the trustee says,\nfine. When you get the ring, give it to me and that's\nrepayment. Yes, okay, done.\nNow, the great, great grandchild being a bit\nof a --\nMR. STRIS: You don't need to say it. I\nunderstand.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. He keeps the\nring.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. My question is\ncould the trustee go to the equity court and say, there\nit is. It's in his pocket. Equity court, I'd like you\nto order that ring to be given to the trust. Can that\nhappen?\nMR. STRIS: The answer is it depends and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It depends. They couldn't\nget that?\nMR. STRIS: It depends, and that -- and that\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: What does it depend on?\nMR. STRIS: -- and that is my answer to\nJustice Scalia's question. It -- it depends on whether\nthe -- what the court believed the intent of the great\ngrandson was at the time the promise was made.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The great grandson's intent\nwas to get the money as fast as he could, and, in fact,\nhe thinks -- when he'll get the ring, he thinks he'll\ngive it back to the trust but -- at least -- yes.\nThat's what he thinks.\nMR. STRIS: Then to be clear, Your Honor,\nthat would not be enforceable as an equitable lien by\nassignment, and it's important --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In other words, a court of\nequity could not have taken the ring?\nMR. STRIS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Like -- what it is it? You\nhave to go back to the 15th century or the 16th? Is\nthere -- is there a case? There must have been cases\nlike that.\nMR. STRIS: Well, we -- we cite a -- we cite\na series of cases in our reply brief, pages 12 and 13,\nthat all stand for this principle. And it's important\nto understand why. The reason why is equitable lien by\nassignment historically only occurred in cases where\nthere was -- for the most part, 99 percent of the\ntimes, occurred in cases where there was insolvency.\nSo the fight was between different creditors. And the\nquestion was, was there an intent to merely just pay\nthis debt as a promise, in which case we don't give\npriority of -- of the ring to this one creditor, or was\nthere the intent to pledge this particular piece of\nproperty as security, in which case we will give it as\npriority?\nAnd I'd like to take a step back because I'm\nconcerned that this comes across as a hyper-technical\nargument, but it's really not because if we start with\nthe background principle that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then suppose there are\nno other creditors.\nMR. STRIS: If there were no --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There's no other creditor.\nMR. STRIS: If --\nJUSTICE BREYER: See, he goes -- there's\nnobody. All there is is the ring. Nobody else makes\nany claim to it whatsoever. Now can the -- can the\ntrustee get it?\nMR. STRIS: The answer is still no.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No.\nMR. STRIS: But -- but I would add to that\nthere -- there are very few cases in that area because\nin that area the person would usually sue at law for\nmoney damages. If they --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. He has no money. All\nhe has is the ring in his pocket.\nMR. STRIS: Yes. That's fair. And the cases\nthat do arise, arise because the person wants that\nspecific piece of property. And at equity, it would\nnot be recoverable. It would only be a claim for money\ndamages at law.\nNow, to take this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I get back to the\n-- the Barnes case that Justice Scalia asked you about?\nIs it a possible distinction of that case that that\ninvolved a contingent fee arrangement, and in other\nwords, the lawyer's labors generated the -- the asset,\nwhile in this case, the claim depends upon the -- the\ncontractual provision?\nMR. STRIS: Certainly, Your Honor, and -- and\nas we note in our -- in our reply brief, many courts\nover the years have described Barnes, Wylie, and the\nother attorney's fees cases cited by MAMSI in this case\nas -- as very narrow exceptions to the strict rule at\nequity because in attorney's fees cases, it was the\nattorney's efforts that created the fund. I don't\nthink we need to rely on that exception.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- I don't understand\nwhat difference that makes. I mean, in both cases\nthere was a commitment to pay the contingent fee. It\nwas a promise. And when the money was collected, the\ncourt said, we're going to enforce an equitable lien\nupon your recovery in order to comply with the promise.\nMR. STRIS: Well, to be clear, Your Honor, we\ndon't rely on the distinction, but we do think the\ndistinction adds some persuasive force, and here's why.\nMy understanding is that these courts viewed the\nBarnes line of cases as a hybrid line of cases.\nThey're willing to relax slightly the very strict rules\nat equity because they think there's an element of\nunjust enrichment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you may not --\nyou may not rely on the distinction, but I would have\nthought your answer might have been that the lawyer had\nan equitable claim apart from the contractual\nprovisions so that when you enforce the contractual\nprovisions, Justice Holmes would have thought of it in\nequitable terms, while here, there's no equitable claim\napart from the particular provisions of the contract.\nMR. STRIS: Well, in candor, Your Honor, I\nwas attempting to suggest that and clearly I didn't say\nit as artfully. But that -- that is -- that is what I\nmeant --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Take it. Take it. It's a\ngood one. Right.\nMR. STRIS: -- about the -- the distinction\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STRIS: I will take it.\nAnd it bleeds very nicely into what I was\nabout to say, which is to take a step back as to why\nthis isn't a hyper-technical argument. It's important\nto start with the background principle that 502(a)(3)\ndoesn't include legal relief, and this is -- this is\nsignificant. If we look at 502(g), there's a very\nnarrow provision for plans to enforce terms that\nrequire certain employers to make contributions to\nplans, and in 502(g) Congress said, well, in this case\nyou can seek liquidated damages to enforce the terms of\nthe plan. You can seek legal relief. In fact, it uses\nthe phrase, legal and equitable relief. So when we sit\nhere today and look at 502(a)(3), it's very easy,\nparticularly on the facts of an individual case, to\nsay, hey, you know, legal relief should be available\nhere. But Congress made the decision only to allow\nequitable relief.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But why is that? I\nmean, we spend a lot of time with these old English\ncases. Why -- why did Congress -- it seems an\narbitrary line.\nMR. STRIS: I don't -- I don't think it is\narbitrary, Your Honor, and I would suggest that there's\ntwo reasons why did that.\nThe first is that as a backdrop rule they\nbelieved that it's not a good policy to have\nfiduciaries suing participants and beneficiaries for\nmoney, and when they thought that there was a good\nreason like 502(g), they expressly enumerated it.\nThe second reason I think that they -- they\ndid this is because the only times when it might make\nsense to recover money for the violation of a plan\nterm, for the most part, fall within -- under the\nrubric of unjust enrichment. And I believe that\nCongress, rightfully so, thought that there were non --\nsufficient non-ERISA remedies whereby a plan could\nassert truly equitable unjust enrichment claims. So\nthere was no need to provide that remedy in the civil\nenforcement provisions of ERISA.\nSo if we look at that as the backdrop rule\nand apply it to Barnes and that line of cases, I would\nsuggest that MAMSI's reading of the Barnes line of\ncases is very dangerous.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you -- do you not think\nthat Congress had in mind no compensatory damages, no\npunitive damages? Do you really think that Congress\nhad in mind the distinction that you are now drawing in\nthe ring case based on 15th and 16th century English\nprecedent?\nMR. STRIS: I -- I wasn't suggesting that\nthey had 15th and 16th century cases in mind.\nCertainly not. I was relying on those cases because\nGreat-West mandates that that's what we do. But I do\nbelieve that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but Great-West also\nsaid money. It said money, identified as belonging in\ngood conscience to the plan. And why doesn't it belong\nin good conscience to the plan when the beneficiary has\npromised that, if it gets a tort recovery, it will\nreimburse the plan?\nMR. STRIS: Okay. Well, that goes to the\nvery heart of why we believe this is a -- a legal claim\nand not an equitable claim. If we look at the\nparticular plan provision here, it allows MAMSI to\ntotally avoid proving any double recovery. And let me\n-- let me give an example, Your Honor.\nThere are 36 States that have limited the\ncollateral source rule. Under the MAMSI plan here, if\na particular plaintiff recovered money in a personal\ninjury suit, it clearly could not recover all, in some\nof the States, part in other States, of its advanced\nmedical expenses because they came from a collateral\nsource. Nonetheless, under the plan, as MAMSI has\nwritten it, they can recover their full amount, and\nthere's nothing equitable in allowing a boiler plate\nprovision to authorize the plan to get contract\ndamages.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't -- isn't the\nsimple answer to that is that the equity court would\nnot enforce any injunction or any mandatory order, or\nwhatever the relief was, if it involved double\nrecovery?\nMR. STRIS: Well, I -- I don't know how\nsimple that answer is, Your Honor, but I would -- I\nwould take it, as Justice Scalia said a moment ago.\nAnd if this Court believes that MAMSI could state that\nsort of equitable claim, we would be very comfortable\nwith a remand in this case to weigh the equitable\nfactors at issue.\nThat didn't occur here, though, because MAMSI\nargued that the contractual terms govern. The court\nagreed. And so as a result, the disclaimer of the\nmade-whole doctrine, the requirement that MAMSI\nestablished double recovery --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what is the double\nrecovery that you're talking about? The plan has paid\nout to the care providers the benefits in full.\nMR. STRIS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And now it wants to get\nback its benefits in full.\nMR. STRIS: Right. And -- and I would\nsuggest that at equity, whether we look at it\nhistorically or even in a modern sense, a subrogation-\nbased claim or an equitable claim would require MAMSI\ndemonstrating that some of the settlement it received\nconstituted a payment for medical expenses. And that\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the plaintiff could so\n-- in the tort litigation, if that's what it is, the\nplaintiff could say, I don't want any medical damages.\nGive me everything for pain and suffering.\nMR. STRIS: That's true, and -- and I would\nsuggest that if that occurred and you applied equitable\nprinciples, the insurer could argue, I think rightfully\nso, that the insurer impaired its subrogation rights.\nThat would be an equitable claim.\nThe point I'm making, Your Honor, is that\nnone of this occurred here because the procedural\nposture of this case was a motion for summary judgment\nat the district court level where MAMSI went in and\nsaid all that matters are the contract terms. We don't\nhave to look at whether the Sereboffs were made whole.\nWe don't have to look at whether there was double\nrecovery. We can't consider our diligence in refusing\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, but they look at the\nmedical expenses were something like $75,000 and the\nsettlement was -- what was it? $750,000.\nMR. STRIS: $750,000, Your Honor. And -- and\nI would suggest that we never had an opportunity to\nintroduce any facts. It --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, did you attempt to?\nMR. STRIS: We did not, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, did -- did you respond\nto the summary judgment by saying, you know, there are\nreasons why they should -- specific reasons why they\nshouldn't get the full 75?\nMR. STRIS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And you were denied a\nhearing on that?\nMR. STRIS: We -- yes. I mean --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That -- that may be a -- a\nreason for you to appeal on the merits, but I don't see\nwhat it has to do with the -- with the jurisdiction of\nthe court as -- as awarding equitable relief. Maybe it\ndid a poor job in deciding what was equitable.\nMR. STRIS: I -- I don't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it -- it has nothing to\ndo with its power to award an equitable remedy.\nMR. STRIS: I don't think that's true, Your\nHonor, because MAMSI didn't move for summary judgment\non an equitable theory. They moved for summary\njudgment on a contractual theory. And page 8 of their\nsummary judgment motion is -- is particularly clear on\nthis. It makes clear that the contract creates,\ngoverns, and is the end all and be all of their rights.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they would have\nnothing to say if they hadn't invoked the contract.\nThey've got to invoke the contract. The question is,\nare they asking for equitable relief?\nMR. STRIS: I don't think they have to invoke\nthe contract, Your Honor, in the sense that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You mean without a contract,\nthey could have gone in and said, we'd like $75,000?\nMR. STRIS: Not under 502(a)(3), but\ncertainly under other principles. Equitable principles\nof subrogation, as MAMSI repeatedly describes in their\nbrief, is a doctrine that is governed by equity. It's\ncreated wholly apart of a contract. And we cite\nnumerous cases for the proposition that you can limit\nby contract --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And are you suggesting that\nthe jurisdiction of the court would have been different\nif they had gone -- if the -- if the plan had gone in\nand said, we don't care anything about our contract,\nwe're just relying on equitable principles of\nsubrogation? In that case, are you suggesting the\ncourt would have had equitable jurisdiction, whereas\nwhen they went in and said, we happen to have a\ncontractual right to this, the court doesn't have\nequitable jurisdiction?\nMR. STRIS: That is a very difficult\nquestion, Your Honor, and I would --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I think that's implicit\nin your argument.\nMR. STRIS: It is an important question, and\nI would answer it this way. I would say that that\nhypothetical presents a much closer question. If the\ncontract merely had a subrogation provision that said\nwe are subrogated and the plan went in and tried to\nenforce that provision by employing equitable\nprinciples, seeking equitable remedies, that would be a\ncloser question. That might be permissible under\n502(a)(3). That's not what occurred here.\nI think it probably wouldn't be permissible\nbecause, although it would seek an equitable remedy, it\nwouldn't be an equitable remedy to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why isn't that what\noccurred here? What -- what's the essential\ndifference?\nMR. STRIS: Oh, the essential difference is\nthat there are various equitable principles that were\ncategorically applied to subrogation claims, including\nreimbursement versions of subrogation claims. And they\ncould not be disclaimed or overridden by contract. The\nburden of the insurer was to establish that there was a\ndouble recovery. That's part of the claim. The burden\nof the insurer was to show that the defendant, the\ninsured, was made whole.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does the -- how does\nthe insurer show that if the parties could just say --\nthe plaintiff can say, I am the master of my complaint.\nI am not seeking damages for medical expenses. I just\nwant damages for lost earnings, pain and suffering.\nMR. STRIS: Right, but my answer to that,\nYour Honor, would be that if it's a lie, meaning if\nthey did get damages for medical expenses, you couldn't\novercome it merely by saying you didn't seek them. And\nif it's true, meaning in the -- in the tort action the\nplaintiff didn't actually seek those damages, then\nthere would be an equitable theory called impairment of\na subrogation right that could be asserted.\nBut this is significant. This isn't -- this\nisn't historical minutia. This is significant because\nit goes to the heart of whether the claim is equitable\nor really just a dressed-up claim to say, hey, you\nbreached this contract provision because when you\ndefine in the contract -- and this goes to your\njurisdictional question, Justice Souter. When you\ndefine in the contract the very contours of\nreimbursement, all you're doing is mandating contract\ndamages. And here, it's worse than that. MAMSI\nexpressly disclaimed the make-whole doctrine. They did\nit in the plan. They -- in their motion for\npreliminary injunction, they cited In re Paris, which\nis a Fourth Circuit case that governs, and you can do\nthat. And even before this Court, they have -- their\nfootnotes 19 and 20 of their -- of their brief --\nthey're not -- they're continuing to rely on their\nability to do that in their contract.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but why -- why isn't\nthe answer to your argument the -- the historical\nanswer that courts of equity frequently provided\nremedies and supplementary remedies when remedies at\nlaw were not fully adequate? And they were still\nequitable remedies. They were still typically\nequitable, and that's what is being requested here?\nMR. STRIS: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't that the answer to\nyour -- your argument?\nMR. STRIS: I would say two things, and then\nI would -- if -- if I'm permitted, I would like to\nreserve the rest of my time.\nFirst, I would say that that's not what's\nbeing requested here, and if MAMSI could state that\nclaim, then a remand is required so they can proceed on\nthat theory.\nThe second thing I would say, though, is that\nthat notion runs square up against Great-West because\nGreat-West said it had to be a claim that was\ntraditionally available in equity, not something that\nan equity court would have jurisdiction over because of\nthe clean-up doctrine, not something that could come\ninto an equity court for another reason, but a remedy\nthat was traditionally equitable. And when you're\nlooking at something like a constructive trust, MAMSI\nis correct to point out that it doesn't matter if\nthere's an adequate remedy at law. A constructive\ntrust historically was an equitable remedy that was\navailable in an equity court even if there was an\nadequate remedy at law. But that doesn't win the day\nfor MAMSI. They still have to prove that they meet the\nrequirements, the tracing requirements, which don't\nexist here in this breach of contract case, and that's\nwhy that remedy is not available.\nSo, if I may, I'd like to reserve my --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Stris.\nMr. Coleman, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. COLEMAN: Good morning, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nSubrogation-based claims have always been\nfundamentally equitable in nature and fit comfortably\nwithin the prescriptive limits of section 502(a)(3).\nThe Court should reject Petitioners' attempt to make\nthese kind of subrogation-based reimbursement\nprovisions universally unenforceable in ERISA plans.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but I mean, once you\nget out of the contract terms and are trying to make\nyour case on the basis of subrogation, you do have to\nshow that -- that part of the recovery was -- was for\nthe -- for the medical expenses. And has that been\nshown?\nMR. COLEMAN: It has been, Your Honor.\nAnd -- and let me make clear what the plan\nsays. The plan, I think, does three things. The plan\nmemorializes our right to subrogation, a -- a right\nthat has existed in equity in modern times and ancient\ntimes throughout the history of equity. Second --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if I can just\nstop you there. Your -- your friend on the other side\ncites the many common law cases not allowing\nsubrogation in this sort of situation, or if it does\nallow it, subject to the make-whole doctrine.\nMR. COLEMAN: I don't believe that he does\ncite cases disallowing it under circumstances anywhere\nclose to this. He did cite in his brief Trist and\nother cases from his reply brief that this Court in\nBarnes expressly disapproved. And so in suggesting\nthat -- that there is not somehow an equitable right\nthat attaches to this type of a plan language, we think\nthat on that additional ground that fails.\nThis type of a claim is a fundamentally\nequitable claim. When we pay over the medical\nexpenses, we obtain a right in equity to receive an\namount up to that which we have provided to the\nPetitioner. Our plan reflects that language. Our plan\nalso goes on to say that it contains a commitment that\nwe will look only to the recovery, to the fund that is\nreceived from a third party by settlement or judgment.\nWe think that that fits clearly within the language of\nBarnes, that we are committing ourselves to a recovery\nthat will look only to the fund that is recovered.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He just said -- your\nbrother said, well -- because I simplified that to the\nring, and he says, well, if in fact you had a\nsubrogation right or some other absolutely clear\ncontractual right to get repaid from the ring, you\nknow, which is a physical thing, you couldn't --\nstronger than your case -- you couldn't get it in\nequity. If I really knew about the 18th century cases,\nI would realize that, and it's only my ignorance that\nand my dissent that prevents me from understanding\nthis.\nMR. COLEMAN: I disagree with his response.\nI think the ring clearly would have been recoverable in\nequity and I -- I don't think there can be any\nreasonable question about that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, fine. Then where\ndo I look?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you cite us to\nsomething for the -- can you cite something to that\neffect?\nMR. COLEMAN: For the -- for the ring\nproposition?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: For your answer.\nMR. COLEMAN: I do think the Barnes line of\ncases that include with it Walker v. Brown and -- and\nother cases fully stand for that type of a proposition,\nthat -- that if you have committed to something that --\nthat requires the return and recovery of a specific\nitem or fund, that is it. I think that type of thing\nwould also fall clearly within the realm of specific\nperformance, which is a known exception to contract-\nbased claims that falls clearly within -- within the\nrealm of equity.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, instead of\nlooking for an equitable counterpart, this is an action\nfor money you think is owing to you under a contract.\nWhy isn't that a classic form of legal relief?\nMR. COLEMAN: Because the right to\nsubrogation exists independent of the contract. This\nCourt has said that numerous times. We've cited cases\nin our brief going back into the 1800's.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why did you cite\nthe contract in your complaint?\nMR. COLEMAN: Because of the specific\nrequirements of ERISA litigation. 502(a)(3) doesn't\nsay that you can bring any claim in equity. It says\nthat we can bring a claim seeking appropriate equitable\nrelief to remedy a violation of the plan or to enforce\nthe terms of the plan. So there is a necessary joining\nof equity and the terms of the plan when you bring --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If equity -- if the\nequitable subrogation claim were subject to the make-\nwhole doctrine or -- or these other equitable\ndoctrines, and your contractual claim is not, which\nrelief are you entitled to? The -- the one subject to\nthe equitable doctrines or the relief that's specified\nin your contract?\nMR. COLEMAN: We believe that the courts of\nappeals have already resolved that question, and that\nis that -- first of all, there are -- there are\nvariations on make-whole. Theirs is only one. Their\nview of it is only one, which is the -- the most --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is your claim subject\nto the equitable doctrines or subject to the legal\ncontractual claim?\nMR. COLEMAN: I don't distinguish between the\ntwo, Your Honor. And ultimately the reason for it is,\nis that a third part of the plan language is that it\ncontains essentially a pre-agreed allocation. That's\nall that it does. It says because of the risk of\nmanipulation in these settlements where the insured\nwill settle a third party claim and say, okay, it's a\nmillion dollars, but let's write $10,000 in for\nmedicals and the rest will be pain and suffering\nbecause we don't want to have to pay back on\nsubrogation. So it is well established, both within and\noutside the ERISA context, in these types of\nsituations, that the subrogation language will contain\nan allocation so that when you get the money coming\nback, it is applied first to the medical damages. That\nis -- that is all that it is. It is -- it is not\nsomething that exists outside.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, are you -- do you\ncontend it's always applied first to the medical\ndamages? In other words, supposing there was --\ninstead of the $750,000 settlement, it had been\n$100,000 here. $75,000 was medical, and they had a lot\nof substantial other claims, pain, suffering, loss of\nearnings, and so forth. Would you always get your full\namount if -- if the amount of the settlement is over\nthe amount of the medical expense?\nMR. COLEMAN: I think we would be entitled to\nit under the -- the terms of the plan.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You think that's the\nequitable rule.\nMR. COLEMAN: Obviously, in -- in doing these\nthings, there's a practical side on -- on the business\nside when they work these things out. But the reason\nthat claim would settled for $100,000 again speaks to\nthe strength of their claim for other kinds of damages.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it might be because\n-- it might be because there's contributory negligence,\nall sorts of things. They might have compromised at 20\ncents on the dollar across the board. Why should you\nget 100 cents when the -- when the rest of the recovery\nonly gets 20 -- 20 cents?\nMR. COLEMAN: Again, it's -- it's because of\nthe nature of the allocation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's equitable in your\nview? What?\nMR. COLEMAN: It is because --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You think that's the\nequitable rule.\nMR. COLEMAN: Yes. Courts in equity in -- in\n-- modern courts in equity in -- in analyzing these\ntypes of -- of claims have permitted these types of\nallocation --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And some do, but some do\nnot I think.\nMR. COLEMAN: I think that's an accurate\nstatement outside of the ERISA context, Justice\nStevens, that there are courts that enforce one form of\nmake-whole that might not. But there are many States\nthat do enforce a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you have piqued my\ncuriosity and -- and didn't satisfy it. You say there\nare variations on make-whole. What -- you were about\nto describe the variations. What are the variations?\nMR. COLEMAN: There are variations that --\nthe -- the most stringent is Petitioners' rule, which\nis we have to be made whole for everything that we\nwanted to claim, pain and suffering. We thought our\nclaim was $1 million and we didn't settle for $1\nmillion, and therefore, we're not made whole.\nThere is -- there is another version that is\nless restrictive than that, but as long as there is a\nshowing that medical expenses have been paid, you get a\nreturn of medical expenses.\nThere are another version -- there's another\nversion that is enforced in many States, including\nVirginia and California and I -- some others I believe,\nin which essentially the make-whole runs the other way\ntowards the insurer, that -- that you have basically a\nfirst dollar type to ensure that the medical expenses\nare paid first.\nThere are -- there are a variety of things,\nbut within the ERISA context, every court of appeals\nthat has addressed this has said that when you put\nthese kinds of terms into the plan -- and they are very\ncommon -- we're not going to adopt from various States\nequitable rules that will contradict the terms of the\nplan and that will --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, it seems to\nme you -- you must be biting your -- your tongue here.\nThere's an easy answer to Justice Stevens and to\nJustice Scalia, and it's that we get all the money\nfirst because that's what the contract says. But you\ncan't give that answer because then it starts to look\nlike a legal claim. Instead, you get mired in all these\nobscure equitable doctrines because you're -- when\nthere's a simple answer there in black and white, but\nit's in the contract. And as soon as you say that, it\nstarts to sound legal rather than equitable.\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, the -- the plan contains\nan allocation agreement that is part of -- the\nallocation agreement is enforceable. Every court of\nappeals that has -- has ruled on this issue has said\nthat they are -- that they are not going to adopt State\ncourt rules that contradict plan terms because that\nwould be contrary to the intent of Congress in enacting\nERISA and in making plan sponsors the -- the governors\nof plan design. So we didn't want that type of thing\nto happen. Every court of appeals has ruled that.\nBut that -- that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The fact that your equitable\nclaim, you know, traces itself to a contract certainly\ndoesn't -- doesn't cause it to cease to be an equitable\nclaim. I mean, the classic equitable claim is somebody\ndeclaring a trust in exchange for some money, and he\ndeclares a trust. Equity will enforce that trust, but\nthe trust is based on a contractual commitment. Right?\nMR. COLEMAN: I believe -- I believe that is\ncorrect.\nWe believe that it runs the other way, that\nour plan language simply reflects an age-old,\nhistorical subrogation right that has existed in equity\nand that has been slightly modified.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If -- if you understand as I\n-- that four people on the Court took a broader view\nthat Congress didn't want to get into this matter, and\nrestitution is restitution, whatever it means now; but\nfive took the historical view. Now, if we're in the\nhistorical view, which we are, that was the majority.\nAt that point, I want to know how you think this case\nshould come out. What words should be written there if\nI'm thinking of the next case?\nAnd after you win this case, if you do, the\nnext case will simply be precisely the same as yours,\nbut the lawyers, having acted 5 minutes quickly -- more\nquickly, will mix up all the funds. Now it's\ncommingled and all we have is exactly the same with\nevery future case that you have, and now the pension\nfund can't get a penny back of the money that it loaned\nthat it should get back in good conscience. No doubt\nabout it. A promise, good conscience, and they can't\nget a penny.\nNow, you have the interest in telling me what\nwords this Court should write, other than overrule\nGreat-Western, that will prevent that result from\ncoming about. I would like to know your --\nMR. COLEMAN: I'll try to get most of that in\norder.\nFirst of all, the Court did -- has ruled.\nIt's an issue of statutory interpretation, and the\nCourt has not usually gone back on it. We're very\ncomfortable with Mertens. We're comfortable with\nGreat-West. We think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I should think your response\nis that Congress provided for only equitable relief.\nMR. COLEMAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and that that's the\n-- that's the answer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In other words, you don't\ncare about these other --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Congress said that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I was actually\ninterested in what your response was because I thought\nyou have an interest in not losing your recovery in all\nthose other cases.\nMR. COLEMAN: Your Honor, we are very\ncomfortable within the law that this Court has set out.\nWe believe that the Court has gotten it right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well -- well, why should\nyou be if -- if an -- if this -- if you prevail in this\ncase and then every other personal injury lawyer will\nmake sure that that recovery goes into a trust for the\ncare of the accident victims, never goes into their own\ninvestment account.\nMR. COLEMAN: Your Honor, that presumes that\n-- that we don't have things that we can do along the\nway before it comes into the attorney's hands. This is\na very interactive process.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but Justice Breyer's\nquestion is the eggs have gotten scrambled. That's the\n-- that's the hypothesis. Are you saying or are you\ngoing to say you can't unscramble the eggs consistently\nwith -- with the limitation to equitable remedies, or\nare you going to say you can unscramble the eggs?\nMR. COLEMAN: Justice Breyer's example is one\nspecifically related to commingling. Commingling\nitself does not, in fact, bar --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's what I meant by\nscrambled eggs.\nMR. COLEMAN: But if -- if you go out and,\nyou know, give out dollar bills on the street till it's\nall gone -- we accept that there are limits to our\nrecovery.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how about Justice\nBreyer's hypothetical? Is the -- is the court under\nERISA incapable of dealing with that situation, or is\nisn't it?\nMR. COLEMAN: The -- the commingling\nsituation is one in which the courts would look to see\nif the person is still essentially in possession of the\nfunds as the Court stated in Great-West. We think\nunder that circumstance it would be.\nI can envision circumstances --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Under that -- under Justice\nBreyer's hypothetical, a court, consistently with\nERISA, could give an equitable remedy?\nMR. COLEMAN: Yes, absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but if the recovery\nis set up in such a way that it never goes into the\npersonal account of the accident victims and, instead,\njust what happened in Great-West, isn't that what every\npersonal injury lawyer will do if you prevail in this\ncase?\nMR. COLEMAN: Then, Justice Ginsburg, we\nwould test the language at the end of Great-West and we\nwould have to go after a different defendant. And we\nwould -- we would have to test our luck under that type\nof situation, go after the person in possession or\ncontrol of the funds, and we would be able to do that.\nAnd we believe that courts would -- would allow that\nand would enforce our equitable rights in that type of\na situation. I don't mean --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would California allow you\nto intervene when it has a no-subrogation rule?\nMR. COLEMAN: There, I believe there's a\nstrong argument that California might not have\npermitted us to intervene at all.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then how are you\ngoing to prevent the funds from being commingled or\nbeing assigned immediately to a trust?\nMR. COLEMAN: I think that our --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure how you\ncan avoid also the trustee being one of the named\nplaintiffs.\nMR. COLEMAN: I -- I think that our remedy is\nunder (a)(3), Your Honor, and that we would -- we would\ntry to act under (a)(3) in terms of enforcing our\nequitable rights that exist.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or you might try to get\nERISA amended.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. COLEMAN: I'm sure you'll wish us luck\nwith that, Justice Scalia. But I think that our rights\nare sufficiently secure under ERISA as it is now\nwritten and under the jurisprudence that this Court has\nset forward. We believe that our plan sufficiently\ncaptures the essence of the age-old equitable\nsubrogation right, that in seeking to enforce that\nplan, we both capture those subrogation-based rights,\nbut our plan also commits to seek funds solely from a\nfund, a res, that will come into existence as a result\nof the third party litigation --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your theory is that\nyour argument would be exactly the same if you did not\nhave this provision in your contract. It's an\nequitable claim. It's an age-old subrogation right.\nYou just sue in equity saying, look, I paid the medical\nexpenses, I'm entitled to it. You don't need the\ncontractual provision at all.\nMR. COLEMAN: We have a right that exists in\nequity independent of the plan, but (a)(3) does have\nthat language that you seek appropriate equitable\nrelief to enforce the terms of the plan. That part of\nit might be missing if we were just out relying solely\non what exists in equity, separate from the plan.\nThat is why the plan memorializes these\nrights. It was Congress' intent that we write the\nterms into the plan so that people can be given notice\nof what is there and they can accept it. They can\nunderstand what is in the plan. And as long as our\nplan is consistent with -- and we believe it is -- in\nseeking what is appropriate equitable relief, then we\nthink that the courts have authority to hear these\nclaims.\nAnd really, there's a lot that's been\ndiscussed here, but the question that has been\npresented to the Court is really only does (a)(3)\nauthorize these types of claim. The answer to that is\nclearly yes, and in asserting that a court should have\nenforced or should have looked at various equitable\ndefenses, we think that's merely a concession that our\nclaim is equitable in nature and that in asserting\nthese various defenses, that -- that the courts of\nappeals have unanimously thus far rejected, the Court\ndoes not need to look at it. Those courts have\ncorrectly decided all of those issues in -- in\nevaluating the -- the balancing of Congress' intent in\nenacting ERISA and putting these kinds of terms into\nplay, allowing plan sponsors to have a lot of deference\nand leeway over how plans are designed and then\nenforcing them under (a)(3) in seeking equitable\nrelief.\nAnd we believe that the Fourth Circuit\nproperly evaluated that and that the court's judgment\nshould be affirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nColeman.\nMr. Feldman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis -- this case is an action for\nappropriate equitable relief under this Court's\ndecision in Great-West. First, it seeks a specifically\nidentifiable fund, which is the money that Petitioners\ngot from their tort settlement. Second, that fund can\nbe traced to Petitioners. It's sitting now in an\ninvestment account, and they've committed to holding it\nthere. Third, the fund belongs in good conscience to\nthe plan because the plan provided that the fund --\nthat that fund, quote, must be used to reimburse the\nplan, quote, for benefits paid.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is this -- to go\nto your first point, how is this specifically\nidentifiable? No court has said that there's this --\nyou only want the medical expenses, and no court has\nsaid there's this much for medical expenses. You have\nto figure out how much of the recovery is allocable to\nmedical expenses. In fact, already did that. They cut\nout some percentage for attorney's fees. It's far\nremoved from the traditional sort of res that we deal\nwith in equity.\nMR. FELDMAN: I don't think that's correct,\nwith respect. In Barnes against Alexander and in the\nwhole line of cases that we cite, the Court has made\nquite clear that parties can commit contractually that\na particular fund that will come into existence in the\nfuture should be used for a certain purpose, and that\nwill be equitably enforced.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we -- how\nenforced? I mean, if you're enforcing a contract, you\ndo that legally not equitably.\nMR. FELDMAN: I don't think that's right.\nAnd if you're enforcing a contract and you're seeking\nnormal contractual damages of various sorts, you\ndefinitely do that legally and not equitably. But\nequity always enforced contracts. They would enforce\nits equitable liens that were created by contract.\nFor example, in the case of Walker against\nBrown, which was not an attorney's fees case -- by the\nway, on -- in Barnes against Alexander, which was an\nattorney's fees case, nowhere in the decision does the\nCourt rely at all on the fact that this had anything to\ndo with any special rule that applies to attorney's\nfees.\nBut that, in turn, relied on the prior case\nof Walker against Brown in which -- just involved an\nequitable lien that was created by contract and that a\nparty was trying to enforce. And the Court quoted\nPomeroy's Treatise. Now, Walker was decided in 1897.\nPomeroy's Treatise on Equity, quote, every express\nexecutory agreement in writing, whereby the contracting\nparty sufficiently indicates an intention to make some\nparticular property, real or personal, or fund therein\ndescribed or identified as a security for a debt,\ncreates an equitable lien upon the property so\ndescribed.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what would happen if\nthis case were a weak case on -- on liability and it\nwas settled for $60,000? What would happen to your\ntracing theory then?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think -- in general, I think\nthat the terms of the plan, both under ERISA law and\nunder these traditional equitable principles that we've\ntalked about or I mentioned just now, that the plan\nwould likely be entitled to get -- get up to the amount\nof the medical expenses --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Presumably such a weak --\nsuch a weak claim would not be brought because there --\nMR. FELDMAN: Right. It is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- there's nothing at the\nend of it.\nMR. FELDMAN: It is the case that in extreme\ncases, for example, the beneficiary has collected the\nmedical benefits, does have some leverage over the\nplan, and in fact, the plan -- and -- and can say,\nwell, I'm not going to bring the claim, I'm not going\nto, you know, do what I can to collect the money unless\nwe come to some kind of agreement. And in fact, the\nplan in this case provides -- that says, the company's\nshare of recovery will not be reduced because your --\nyou have not received the full damages claimed, unless\nthe company agrees in writing to a reduction. And they\nleave it open there, in appropriate cases, for\nthe parties to negotiate that.\nBut there was no bar in equity for an\nequitable court to enforce an equitable lien that arose\nout of a contract where that satisfied the -- the\nstandards for an equitable lien.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are these claims\nsubject to the qualifications that go along with the\nequitable lien, the make-whole, whatever the applicable\nrules are?\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, first of all, make-whole\nI think is best -- there are a variety of make-whole\nrules in addition to those that Mr. Coleman\nmentioned. There's rules where you prorate the\nsettlement in certain ways so that you get some\nproportion. But the basic make-whole rule, as has been\ndescribed by the courts of appeals, is a default rule\nand that is where you're just relying on a pure\nsubrogation clause or you don't mention it all in a\nparticular insurance document, then some courts have\nsaid you apply some kind of make-whole rule or some\nother allocation rule to figure out how much of the\ntort recovery goes to the insurer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that wouldn't\napply here because you're relying on the contract.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right, where you -- where the\nparties have specified. Even in other -- in insurance\nlaw generally, where the parties have specified in the\ninsurance contract how that's supposed to work, then\nthe courts will enforce that. And there's nothing\nunusual in courts of equity taking a look at the\nagreement that was reached between a -- the parties,\npresumably supported by consideration, in deciding what\nkind of relief to grant. That was a traditional\nfunction that equity served.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So even if you had an\nearly neutral evaluator who said this entire claim with\npain and suffering and the medical, it's -- all together\nit's $100,000. But there was some contributory\nnegligence. So I think $80,000 would be right. So\nthere would still be no prorating --\nMR. FELDMAN: I think, first of all, the --\nthe question presented in this case is whether there's\na cause of action. Those -- that question really goes\nto the amount of money that gets recovered in the cause\nof action, and actually the -- the question presented\nin the petition doesn't squarely present that.\nBut insofar as where you're going on to that\nfurther -- because this case can be just answered by\nsaying, yes, there's a cause of action under 502(a)(3).\nNow, insofar as the Court goes further into the make-\nwhole doctrine, I think generally courts should --\ncourts have recognized that under ERISA what they're\nsupposed to do is enforce the terms of the plan.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what if the plan\nsaid -- you know, this is an insurance company. They\ndon't like litigation -- we are subrogated to double\nwhatever the medical expenses are that we contributed?\nThat's our recovery. It's an equitable claim, but\nit's going to be enforced according to the terms of the\nplan.\nMR. FELDMAN: The Court has recognized that\n-- that Federal courts, especially in an unusual\ncircumstance like that -- but Federal courts do have\nthe obligation under ERISA to determine a common law of\nrights and obligations under ERISA plans. And there\nare doctrines like unconscionability and other\ndoctrines that may be applied in particular cases where\nsome plan is just taking advantage of another party,\nwhere --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you would still\ncall that an equitable claim?\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes. It would still be an\nequitable claim because the question still is are you\nenforcing the terms of the plan, and -- and the\nequitable lien cases make quite clear that that court\nin equity will enforce that so long as a particular --\nso long as a particular fund, even if it has not yet\ncome into existence, is what's been specified. In\nfact, the cases that are cited by Petitioners' counsel\nto the contrary, starting with the Trist case, was a\ncase that was specifically disapproved in Barnes\nagainst Alexander as resting on other grounds. That\nwas a case where the -- there was a contingent fee for\nlobbying Congress and there was a statute that forbade\nit. There were two other grounds that the Court\ndecided the case, and then Justice Holmes in the Barnes\ncase went on to say -- well, insofar as the question is\nopen, he gave the answer, which is the question as to\nwhether there's an equitable lien is determined by what\nthe contract says.\nAs far as the make-whole doctrine, another\npoint about the make-whole doctrine that's worth\nkeeping in mind is that insofar as some States have\napplied it, as a matter of their insurance law and have\nsaid, well, an insurance company is not allowed under\nour State's law to contract out of the make-whole\ndoctrine which we -- under our State's law is the\ndefault rule. Insofar as a State has said that, that\nwould apply equally to ERISA plans under the insurance\nsavings clause and there wouldn't be any question I\nthink that it would. But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It would apply simply as a\nmatter of -- of contract construction in determining\nwhat the contract was that -- that would be looked to\nfor determining what equitable remedy would be\navailable.\nMR. FELDMAN: That's right. And if the\ninsurance contract departed from what the State's law\nwas, the State's law would govern it under ERISA's\ninsurance savings clause.\nBut where you have an -- and so the -- the\ncase with ERISA plans is not really any different than\nit is outside ERISA. Insofar as a State under its\ninsurance law decides to establish a make-whole\ndoctrine or an allocation rule of some sort or a\ndefault rule, it can do that, and that can be applied\nto insured ERISA plans. But as to uninsured ERISA\nplans, it wouldn't be applied. And that -- this Court\nestablished that in its decision in FMC against\nHolliday.\nThis case really actually arises -- it was\nreally -- it was at the intersection of two distinct\ndoctrines that -- two distinct lines of cases that both\nsupport equitable relief in a case like that. One is\nthe -- those that I've spoken about already, which is\nthe equitable lien cases. The other is the line of\nsubrogation cases that Mr. Coleman spoke about. And\nfrom the very earliest times, it was recognized in\nsubrogation cases that that gave the insurer not only a\nright to advance the insured's claim, but where the\ninsured advanced the claim and got a recovery, he holds\nit as a trustee for the insurer. And that was\nrecognized from the early -- from the mid-18th century\ncases that Mr. Coleman cited in his brief. It was\nrecognized by this Court in Comegys -- the Comegys\ncase, written by Justice Story in the 1820's, and it's\nbeen a consistent rule. And this is an appropriate\nequitable relief to enforce the terms of the plan\nbecause it arises directly at the confluence of those\ntwo lines of equitable cases.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nFeldman.\nMr. Stris, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. STRIS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIn my limited time, I'd like to make three\nvery brief points.\nThe first point I'd like to make is why these\nclaims are never permissible under 502(a)(3). And I\nthink it comes out of a -- a concession that Mr.\nColeman made in his argument. He answered your\nquestion, Mr. Chief Justice -- and he said that they\nwould have had this equitable right without any plan\nprovision. But, hey, they put the plan provision in\nbecause that's what section 502(a)(3) requires. You\ncan only get equitable relief to remedy the violation\nof a plan. That's why these claims are never\nauthorized under 502(a)(3) because they're not really\nto -- to enforce or remedy the violation of a plan\nterm. More importantly, though, that's not what\nhappened here because in this contract they disclaimed\nthe very equitable principles.\nAnd that brings me to my second point, which\nis that even if the answer to the question we presented\nin our cert petition is sometimes, the question is\nstill presented. The answer to the question could be\nthat, as you put it, Justice Souter, jurisdictionally\nsometimes these claims for reimbursement are\nauthorized, and the sometimes is when the contract\ndoesn't disclaim equitable principles because if the\nparty relies on the contract and fails to establish the\nequitable principles that make the remedy equitable,\nthen it's nothing more than a breach of contract\ndamages case.\nAnd Mr. Coleman's answer was very\ninteresting. He tried to -- to sort of squirm out of\nthat by suggesting that, no, it's equitable because\nthis was a pre-allocation of how the money would be\ndistributed. Well, where I'm sitting, that looks an\nawful like a liquidated damages provision for a breach\nof contract. And there's nothing wrong with a\nliquidated damages provision, but this Court has\nsquarely held that that's legal relief when it's for a\nbreach of contract. It's prohibited by section\n502(a)(3).\nAnd that brings me to my final point, which\nis this. Just because the source of the claim is the\ncontract doesn't mean that there can never be an\nequitable remedy. We never take this position, Justice\nScalia. But what it does mean is that the plaintiff\nhas to fit within one of the narrow exceptions at\nequity for an equitable remedy if they're seeking money\nfor a violation of a plan term.\nAnd I'll close by saying that this theory of\nlien by assignment is very dangerous because it is not\nrestitution. It does not require tracing. Plans could\nwrite terms in that say, if you breach this provision\nof the contract, we are entitled to specific funds out\nof any bank account that you may have in the bank at\nthe time that you breach the contract. Under their\ntheory of the Barnes line of cases, that would be\nequitable lien by assignment. That clearly bars legal\nrelief.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Stris.\n"
