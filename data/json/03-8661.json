        "content": "(11:03 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument in the\ncase of Smith against Massachusetts.\nMr. Nathanson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. NATHANSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. NATHANSON: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe trial judge found Melvin Smith not guilty on\nthe merits and unequivocally so. That acquittal entitled\nMelvin Smith to repose. Instead, what he got was a moving\ntarget. The trial judge's later reconsideration of\nSmith's acquittal placed him in jeopardy for that same\noffense twice.\nSmith's position on the matter is completely\nfaithful to this Court's precedent, and it makes sense in\nthe real-world practice of criminal law.\nThe State, on the other hand, asks this Court to\nmake exceptions to the rule, long-held, that acquittals\nterminate jeopardy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No. Just to say that this --\nwhat happened here was not a final determination.\nTake an analog -- an analogy to rule 54(b). The\njudge can say, yes, I've made this ruling and it sticks.\nYou see, I'm going to give you a separate piece of paper\nthat says judgment, but if I don't give you that separate\npiece of paper, even though I said judgment granted, it\ndoesn't count until the very end of the case. I can\nalways change my mind. Why shouldn't it operate the same\nway on the criminal side?\nMR. NATHANSON: Well, first of all, obviously,\nthat's a civil case. The Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't\napply to civil cases. Second of all -- except with some\nrare exceptions.\nWhat I think the best way to -- to really define\nfinality here -- and -- and whatever finality is, I really\ndo think we -- we do have it here because this Court has\nsaid an acquittal under Martin Linen, a resolution,\ncorrect or not, of some or all if the factual elements --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but I looked at Martin\nLinen, and there, there was something labeled judgment of\nacquittal entered. Here we have an endorsement on a\nmotion, and then we have an entry by the clerk saying --\nwhat does the entry say? Motion granted or something like\nthat.\nMR. NATHANSON: Allowed, and it was attested by\nthe clerk.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But is there -- this\nmight be significant. Is there in Massachusetts, when a\nmotion for acquittal is granted and there are other\ncharges still going on, is there a piece of paper that\nsays, judgment, acquitted on count whatever it was?\nMR. NATHANSON: No, Your Honor. The -- the\nformal rule, which is not always observed, but the formal\nrule is that it must be recorded on -- on the docket and\nannounced in an open courtroom. That happened here.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose you have a State\nand the State has a statute, and the statute says any\nmotion for acquittal may be granted by the -- the trial\ncourt at the close of the prosecution's evidence, but that\nmotion shall not be deemed final and may be reviewed by\nthe district court at any time before -- or by the trial\ncourt at any time before the submission of the case to the\njury. Then there's no repose element because the -- the\ndefendant is on notice that this may not be final. What\nwould be the -- your position in that case if a statute\nlike that were on the books? And if you say that that's\ndifferent, then I'll say, well, suppose the supreme court\nof Massachusetts just makes up this rule as a judicial\nmatter.\nMR. NATHANSON: Well, to answer the first\nquestion, I think that if -- if such a statute were\nenacted, I'm willing to grant, for purposes of this case,\nthat it wouldn't be a double jeopardy problem. It may in\na later case -- and you know, I'd be very interested in\nthat -- a problem under a combination of Jackson and\nWinship because the defendant may have a -- a right to\nthat determination.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay, well, let -- let's just\nassume that you've conceded that. Now, you've been\nguarded about it. If we can do that by statute, why can't\nwe do that by a judicial decision by the supreme court of\n-- Judicial Court of Massachusetts?\nMR. NATHANSON: Well, first of all, the Supreme\nJudicial Court of Massachusetts is the one who promulgated\nthe rules in this case. Rule 25(a) is promulgated by the\nSupreme Judicial Court of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but they put a gloss on\nthe rule by their decision.\nMR. NATHANSON: Well, that was the Massachusetts\nAppeals Court, I might add.\nSecond of all, the rule itself requires that the\nmotion shall be ruled upon at that time. It says nothing\nabout reconsideration, and clearly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They've held that in this case.\nWe have a Massachusetts decision. It's their law and\nunder their law in Massachusetts, the judge can revise it.\nMR. NATHANSON: Actually --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if it isn't their law,\nthen I don't know how -- why they affirmed this conviction\nrather than reversing it.\nMR. NATHANSON: I'm not sure I know either, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, but I mean, I -- I\ntake it that it is their law, otherwise I'd see reversal,\nwouldn't I, and not affirmance?\nMR. NATHANSON: Actually I think what they\ndid --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What?\nMR. NATHANSON: -- Your Honor, is they assumed\nthat there was an error in -- in -- when dealing strictly\nwith the rule, at the -- at the end of the section dealing\nwith this, they assume that there was an error and said no\nprejudice, which I've contended in the brief --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so in other words,\nthey're saying that in this case -- how could there not be\nprejudice? He had another trial. I mean -- how could --\nI don't understand this from beginning to end then.\nBut let me go back to my original question.\nWhat rule do you propose?\nMR. NATHANSON: As for finality, the rule I\npropose is, first of all, we have to start with the basic\nfoundation, which is an acquittal, under Martin Linen with\na resolution --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I'm saying is, for double\njeopardy purposes --\nMR. NATHANSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- an acquittal in your view is\nan acquittal for double jeopardy purposes when?\nMR. NATHANSON: There's -- there's three things\nthat I think Court should look at. One, first of all,\nbecause we treat acquittals from the bench for double\njeopardy purposes the same as acquittals from a jury, a\nprosecutor can poll a jury immediately after the verdict.\nA prosecutor clearly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I'm asking you for a --\nI'd have to write -- if I agreed with you, I'd have to say\nwe have here a judge who changed his mind. Under the\nclause of the Constitution, a judge cannot change his mind\nwhen. Now, go ahead. Now, fill in the blanks.\nMR. NATHANSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: According -- I know what their\nrule is. Their rule is a judge can change his mind up to\nthe point that the jury is dismissed, something like that.\nI understand that. Now, I want to know what your rule --\nis your rule a judge cannot change his mind once he writes\nthe word acquittal on a piece of paper, even if he says,\noh my God, I meant to say no acquittal? Too late. Too\nlate. Okay, now, so I want to know what your rule is. Is\nthat the rule?\nMR. NATHANSON: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What is the rule?\nMR. NATHANSON: The -- your first question --\nthe constitutional point of no return, shall we say, is\nfurther proceedings. If there is an acquittal and there\nare further proceedings --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is no further proceeding\nif he writes the word acquittal, I guess until he changes\nhis mind. So 3 minutes later, he says I change my mind.\nNow there are further proceedings.\nMR. NATHANSON: Well, then at that point you\nlook to other indicia of finality that this -- this Court\nreferenced that in -- in Vincent, and that -- that's\ngenerally compliance with State procedure. Compliance\nwith State procedures --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I need to write a simple rule.\nAll I'm trying to get from you is what is your rule. Is\nyour rule that when a judge writes the word acquittal --\nan acquittal, by the way, happens to mean there's nothing\nleft for the jury to do on that charge. That's what it\nmeans. When he writes the word acquittal, he cannot change\nit. Is that your rule?\nMR. NATHANSON: No. The rule is that the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. And what is your rule?\nMR. NATHANSON: The rule is that the judge\ncannot change it, as a matter of Federal constitutional\nlaw, if there are further proceedings. In a multi-count\ncase, count A is acquitted. We initiate further\nproceedings on count B and C.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But your answer just isn't\nresponsive. When has it become final?\nMR. NATHANSON: It ripens at the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: When? When the judge says\nsomething, when he writes something? When does it become\nfinal? At what point in time?\nMR. NATHANSON: What I'm suggesting is --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What is your proposed rule?\nYou haven't said yet.\nMR. NATHANSON: What -- what I'm suggesting is\n-- is two things.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Just one thing. Just when\ndoes it become final? Let's limit it to one thing.\nMR. NATHANSON: It -- it becomes final when\nthere are further proceedings initiated.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Sorry. I don't understand\nthat.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: That doesn't make sense.\nMR. NATHANSON: The -- the -- that is the line\ndrawn by most of the lower courts.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're not understanding my\nquestion then. Imagine a case in which a judge writes the\nword acquittal. Now, half an hour later, he thinks, oh,\nmy God, what have I done. The jury is still sitting\nthere. Of course, they're sitting there because he hasn't\nhad a chance to dismiss them yet. They happened to be\nhaving lunch or something. Is it final?\nMR. NATHANSON: It is not final --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is not final.\nMR. NATHANSON: -- if -- if the defense has not\nbeen forced at that point to choose to rest or put on a\ncase. That is the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Say that again.\nMR. NATHANSON: If the defense is forced to rest\nor put on a case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But he wrote the word\nacquittal. There's nothing more for anybody to do until\nhe changes the word.\nMR. NATHANSON: Well, I think we're talking\nabout two separate things. Is Your Honor's question\npresupposing a single-count case or a multi-count?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let's try single-count. Okay?\nMR. NATHANSON: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There he is. He writes the\nword acquittal and the jury says, oh, what do we do now?\nGo home, says the clerk. Now, before they can get out the\ndoor or anything else happens, before they get out the\ndoor, he says, oh, my God, I made a mistake. Can he do\nthat under your rule?\nMR. NATHANSON: I'm not entirely sure of the\nanswer to the question, Your Honor, but I -- I think,\nfirst of all, we look at compliance with State procedure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. What I thought from\nreading your brief, which you're confirming, is your rule\n-- once the judge says acquittal, that's the end of it.\nIf he decides 3 seconds later, he cannot change his mind.\nNow, that rule to me is inconsistent with most law.\nMR. NATHANSON: If we're talking about a\nclerical error, Your Honor, the Massachusetts rules and\nthe Federal rules provide for correction of clerical\nerrors. What -- what we're talking about here is not a\nclerical error, but the judge clearly intended to do what\nshe did.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, was your client --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But a very plain error --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- was your client prejudiced\nin any way by not putting on some evidence that the -- he\nwould have put on?\nMR. NATHANSON: May I begin, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Just answer the question for\nonce.\nMR. NATHANSON: Yes, Your Honor. There -- there\nwas a defense that he essentially forfeited by not being\naware that the judge was going to, at some point --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was a terribly risky\ndefense because his main defense is I wasn't there, I\ndidn't do it, somebody else did it. How could he then\nturn around and say I missed the opportunity to tell the\njury I really was there, but it was okay for me to have\nthe gun? I mean, what -- what defense counsel would do\nthat after having spent his whole effort to say it was the\nother guy, it wasn't this defendant? And then to make\nthis defense that he had a right to possess this gun\nbecause he belonged in the house, that would be\nextraordinary.\nMR. NATHANSON: Your Honor, counsel for co-\ndefendant, Felicia Brown, presented just such a defense\nand she was acquitted. She presented the defense that\nMelvin Smith did not shoot Christopher Robinson, but if\nMelvin --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Nobody charged her with\npossessing a gun.\nMR. NATHANSON: But what I'm saying is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- look, there were a\nlot of charges in this case, and we're dealing with what\nis a relatively lesser offense of this whole string of\nevents so that Brown being acquitted of other offenses\ndoesn't say anything about this offense, which relates to\nthe possession of a gun. That's -- that's all that it is.\nMR. NATHANSON: What I'm saying is that it\nwasn't risky, Your Honor, because the -- this jury was\nwilling to consider an alternative defense that would have\notherwise appeared as a concession. They did not take it\nas a concession.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he would be -- the\ndefendant -- you know, he hasn't gone to the jury yet, and\nthe jury would say, my goodness, this is like a common law\npleader. I didn't borrow the kettle. It was broken when\nI got it. Or, I returned it unbroken. To -- to do that, to\nsay I wasn't there, that's my main defense, but then,\njury, I'd like you also to consider that if you think that\nI was there, then -- it -- it really doesn't fly as a\ncriminal defense.\nMR. NATHANSON: I'd just respectfully disagree,\nYour Honor. But -- but the -- the larger point is if we\nallow this rule in general, we are going to engender\nserious problems. I'm saying that there -- that there was\nsome reliance here, but we're going to engender much more\nserious problems in other cases where a defendant perhaps\npresents a defense that is helpful to the remaining\ncharges, but damaging on the acquitted charge.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but if -- if -- you\nknow, we shape the expectation by what we say. If -- if\nwe say that a judge is always free to consider his ruling\nand as long as the -- there's a right to reopen, then any\nkind of reliance is -- is misplaced.\nMR. NATHANSON: What Massachusetts law says in\n-- in the Zavala case, they said that there is not a right\nto reopen where the judge has determined that the evidence\nis insufficient.\nSecond of all --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That is when the case is not\nongoing. I mean, here we had a case that was continuing\nand -- and the judge said, oops, I made a mistake, which\nis common at the trial level. I mean, these decisions --\nshe made this decision in a split second. Maybe she was\ntoo hasty, and then a trial judge will say, my law clerk\nwent to the library at lunch, there was a Supreme Judicial\nCourt of Massachusetts case going just the other way, so\nof course, I confess error, but the defendant isn't\nprejudice.\nThe defendant hadn't put on a -- well, the -- it\ncame up at closing. Right? So if the defendant was\nprejudice, anyway he could have said, wait a minute,\njudge, I want to put on that defense that I really was\nthere but I had a right to have the gun.\nMR. NATHANSON: He didn't say that, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he could have. So he --\nso I don't see that you have a realistic claim of\nprejudice.\nMR. NATHANSON: Well, I -- I don't think\nprejudice is a factor in double jeopardy jurisprudence.\nEither the defendant has been placed twice in jeopardy or\nhe has not.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you have to set a --\na point in time, and your point is -- well, it's not\nexactly clear, but there's one point that says when the\njury is discharged. Then there may be other reasons why\nthere's unfairness to the defendant so that you wouldn't\npermit it, other than double jeopardy. But if -- why\nisn't that a sensible place to draw the line?\nMR. NATHANSON: Because if -- if discharge of\nthe jury is the rule, then the judge can reconsider an\nacquittal at any point in a defendant's case. 2 weeks\ninto a defense case, the judge could reconsider an\nacquittal.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The question -- we're talking\nabout a Federal constitutional rule, and suppose -- you\npointed out this went only to an intermediate appellate\ncourt. Suppose the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\ninterpreted its rule at 25(a) and it says, that rule\nallows some leeway for the judge to say I got it wrong as\nlong as there's no prejudice to the defense. That's what\nour rule means.\nMR. NATHANSON: I don't think that's\npermissible, Your Honor. It -- it is -- granted, for\npurposes of this argument, that it's permissible for\nStates to order judges to withhold rulings, that there\nshall be no ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence\nprior to the return of a jury verdict. Louisiana, for\nexample, does that, and I think Oklahoma.\nBut for the Supreme Judicial -- Judicial Court\nof Massachusetts to say that an acquittal has no force is\nsimply straight contravening what this Court has said.\nIt's -- it's essentially a continuing jeopardy argument.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you do agree, I take it,\nthat if the judge says, yes, I agree with you, there isn't\na scintilla of evidence, and -- and at some point I'm --\nI'm going to enter an acquittal, but I'm not going to do\nit now just in case I have a second thought, but at least\nby the -- the end of the trial, I'll take care of it, you,\nI take it, concede that that is permissible.\nMR. NATHANSON: I think that is permissible\nbecause --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if that -- if that's\npermissible, if you win this case, isn't that going to be\nthe way trials are conducted when -- when there are mid-\ntrial motions like yours? Every judge is going to say,\nyes, looks as though you -- you got them there, but I'll\n-- I'll just hold onto this until things are over, and\nthen I'll rule. That's -- that's the way they're all\ngoing to respond, isn't it?\nMR. NATHANSON: No, I don't think so, Your\nHonor. I think judges are -- are intelligent people.\nThey read the pleadings beforehand. Justice Donovan\nclearly read the pleading beforehand in this case, and she\n-- she was prepared to ask for argument on it. I don't\nthink that judges do these things so precipitously that\nthey are not going to be confident in their ruling.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but every judge knows he\ndrops a catch once in a while, and -- and if he wants to\nguard against wrecking the whole trial or -- or creating\nan appellate issue later, he's just going to be cautious\nand hold onto it.\nMR. NATHANSON: And judges should be cautious,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it also important to\nknow, though, whether the defendant has to put on a case\nor not? So he can't just reserve judgment. I'll tell you\nafter the trial is over whether you should put a case on\nor not.\nMR. NATHANSON: That -- that is, in fact, the\npoint, Justice Stevens. The Double Jeopardy Clause is a\nconstitutional policy of finality for the defendant's\nbenefit. He -- that's what this Court said in Jorn. The\ndefendant has to know whether he -- he's defending a case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But does -- does --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the defendant here ask to\nbe -- to have the right to reopen?\nMR. NATHANSON: He did not.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: May I ask --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Did he --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- you another question here?\nThere -- there were three charges against your client, as\nI understand it. Unlawful possession of a firearm.\nThat's the one we're talking about.\nMR. NATHANSON: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Assault with intent to\nmurder.\nMR. NATHANSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Assault and battery by means\nof a dangerous weapon.\nMR. NATHANSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: The jury convicted on all\nthree.\nMR. NATHANSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, he was given concurrent\nsentences.\nMR. NATHANSON: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is that correct?\nMR. NATHANSON: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So would you explain to me if\nthere's any practical effect to your winning in this case?\nMR. NATHANSON: There is a practical effect.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What is it?\nMR. NATHANSON: Firearm possession offenses in\nMassachusetts have restrictions as to parole and good time\ndeductions that the other offenses do not have. So there\nis a practical effect, aside from the fact that it's a --\nit's a conviction on his record, Your Honor.\nMoving on, Justice Breyer, just to address the\nquestion that you were asking me, I think perhaps a good\nway to phrase it is -- is if the first factual resolution\nof the elements of -- of the offense results in acquittal,\nthere can be no further proceedings.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I was thinking is -- I\nmean, here a judge -- I guess she was harried in the\ntrial, she's thinking to herself, well, let's see, is\nthere any evidence here that this was less than the\nshotgun -- this was not a shotgun. You know, it had to be\na barrel less than 16 inches. So is there any evidence\nhere of the shotgun? And she, I guess, forgot that there\nwas a lot of evidence that it was a pistol. Now, there\naren't many pistols that are 16 inches long. So she's\nthinking, something may be missing here. She's a little\nuncertain, but she writes acquittal, and then a few\nminutes later, she thinks, let's say, oh, my God, there\nwas all that evidence about the pistol. So I shouldn't\nhave done that.\nI mean, how -- how is a judge like that, a\nhypothetical -- what's she supposed to do? Is she\nsupposed to say, I better not enter anything, because\nafter all, I don't care if the defendant has to produce a\ncase? Or is she supposed to enter something and think,\nwell, I could change my mind before it's over? Or what is\nshe supposed to do? She just thinks she made a mistake.\nMR. NATHANSON: So your hypothetical is that\nthere's evidence of two guns?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought here there was\nevidence there was a pistol, but maybe I'm wrong.\nMR. NATHANSON: I'm sorry. Yes, in this case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There was evidence it was a\npistol. So I -- I would have thought, reading this, that\nthere was evidence. That's beside the point, but I'm --\nI'm just using it as an example where a judge might think\nshe made a mistake. She thought there was no evidence\nthat it wasn't a shotgun, and I guess she forgot that\nthere was evidence it was a pistol and a pistol is not a\nshotgun.\nMR. NATHANSON: She -- she clearly didn't\nforget. The prosecutor said to her the evidence was\ntestified to that it was a pistol, it was a revolver, it\nwas a .32 --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm quite sure -- not\nquite sure then why she wrote down there was no evidence\nit wasn't a shotgun, but she had some reason. And now a\nfew minutes later, she thinks, boy, whatever my reason is,\nit couldn't have been that good. Or maybe she thinks that\nthat's a reason an hour from now or maybe a day from now.\nWhat's the line? Suppose she thinks of it a second from\nnow. Suppose she thinks the instant she writes acquittal,\nshe thought, oh, my God, a pistol is not a shotgun. Of\ncourse, it isn't. I know that. I better change it. Is\nit a second from now? Is it she can never change it no\nmatter what once the pen leaves the paper? What's your\nrule?\nMR. NATHANSON: In a single-count case, Your\nHonor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Whether it's single-count or\ndouble-count or triple-count. I want to know what -- how\nyou see it, not how I see it.\nMR. NATHANSON: It -- compliance with State\nprocedure informs the inquiry and once -- once we have\nwhat is determined to be a resolution --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Once it's final under State\nprocedure, right? And you also would add once there's no\nclerical error. She didn't mistakenly say, you know,\naffirm when she meant to write deny. Leaving that aside,\nonce it's final under State procedure, it's final.\nMR. NATHANSON: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And sometimes it's wrong.\nMR. NATHANSON: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it'd be sometimes wrong no\nmatter how you define final. I mean, you know, she\nlet's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's excellent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- let's all the evidence on\nand -- and does it after all the evidence is there, and\nthen she -- and then at the close of all the evidence, she\ngives a directed verdict for -- for the defendant, and\nthen discharges the jury, and as soon as the jury walks\nout, oh, my God, what a mistake I made. Too bad. Right?\nI mean, we say double jeopardy.\nMR. NATHANSON: Correct, Your Honor. That's\nwhat --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Excellent. That was an\nexcellent answer.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I would like to know,\ngiven that answer, why is this final under State procedure\nbecause it seems as if the State courts of Massachusetts\nhave said, no, it is not a constitutional error to go and\nlook into this again. She can change her mind. And\nthat's what I'd like you to focus on because I agree that\nthat was a good explanation of the rule.\nMR. NATHANSON: If -- if State procedure, as in\nthis --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm thinking of this case.\nMR. NATHANSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose I took Justice Scalia's\nrule and I said, that's the rule. Now, I would say that's\nthe rule of a Federal law. Very well. That turns on your\ndecision here being final as a matter of State law, but it\nseems to me we have State courts here saying, at least for\ndouble jeopardy purposes, it isn't final as a matter of\nState law. And therefore, I want to know how we reach\nyour conclusion here.\nMR. NATHANSON: Well, there's -- there clearly\nis a line beyond which the State cannot go, and that's\nwhat Justice Brennan was talking about in his concurrence\nin Lydon. He said the -- the State cannot fashion a\nprocedure whereby the judge never discharges the jury, and\nin -- in Kepner, this Court held that the Philippine\nprocedure of withholding finality from an acquittal in a\nbench trial also violated the Constitution. So State\nprocedure does not control. It is sufficient but not\nnecessary.\nIf -- if you comply with State procedure to say\nthis is -- this is an acquittal, okay, it's an acquittal.\nIf you do not comply with State procedure, it can still be\nan acquittal under Federal law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does the State have the power\nto say whether -- whether an acquittal under State law\nconstitutes an acquittal for purposes of Federal\nconstitutional double jeopardy purposes? Is that a State\nlaw question or a Federal question?\nMR. NATHANSON: No. It -- it is a Federal\nquestion, Your Honor. This Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was.\nMR. NATHANSON: -- this Court said that in\nSmalis quite clearly.\nIf I -- if I may, two things and then I'd like\nto reserve. But the -- the State would have this Court\ndraw a distinction between acquittals by a judge and\nacquittals by a jury. That simply has been rejected by\nthis Court numerous times. Sanabria, Rumsey. An\nacquittal is an acquittal.\nAgain, the -- the State would have this Court\ndraw distinctions between acquittals based on law and\nacquittals based on fact. Sanabria unequivocally rejected\nthat. Sanabria says that in fact sufficiency of the\nevidence is not a legal defense. An acquittal is an\nacquittal.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like to\nreserve the balance of my time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMs. Neaves.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CATHRYN A. NEAVES\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. NEAVES: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nI'd like to start with where the Court left off\non the notion of reconsideration and finality. The\nMassachusetts Appeals Court here specifically stated that\na judge's right to reconsider his or her legal rulings is\nfirmly rooted in the common law and permitted Judge\nDonovan in this case to reconsider her legal ruling that\nthe evidence was insufficient. Certainly that common law\nright of reconsideration could not run afoul of this\nCourt's double jeopardy jurisprudence, but the appeals\ncourt specifically stated that the Double Jeopardy Clause\nwas not violated because there was no second proceeding\nand that the judge in this case, therefore, was permitted\nto reconsider her ruling.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if this had\nbeen the sole count, the gun possession count had been the\nsole count, and -- and the same ruling had been made by\nthe judge? Would you say that there was double jeopardy\nattaching or not?\nMS. NEAVES: Not so long as the jury was still\nthere. If the prosecutor had the opportunity to say,\nJudge Donovan, give me 10 minutes, I know there's a\nSupreme Judicial Court case on the point that I'm arguing\nto you, which is that you did not need a witness to\ndirectly testify that the gun barrel length was less than\n16 inches, I know there's a case, give me 10 minutes, take\na recess, and if the judge agreed to do that and the\nprosecutor came back and gave the case to the judge and\nthe judge said, absolutely, you're -- you're correct, I'm\ngoing to send the charge to the jury, there's no double\njeopardy violation there.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And what if it's a bench trial?\nMS. NEAVES: A bench trial is a very difficult\nsituation. And the Smalis case certainly seems to be the\nhardest case here, but bench trials present different -- a\ndifferent situation because the judge is both the fact-\nfinder and the law-giver. And in that context, it's much\nmore difficult --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I know it's difficult. What's\nyour answer?\nMS. NEAVES: My answer to that is I believe that\nif the judge stated the evidence is insufficient, as -- as\nthe judge did in Smalis, as the trier of fact and law, I\nfind the evidence --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's over.\nMS. NEAVES: It's over. It's over.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The minute --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if in the case --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the minute he --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- we have before us the State\nallowed an interlocutory appeal on behalf of the\nprosecution right after the judge's ruling?\nMS. NEAVES: In a jury case, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMS. NEAVES: I think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Conceivably they could allow\nan interlocutory appeal from a judgment of acquittal at\nthe close of the prosecution's case.\nMS. NEAVES: If such a -- if such a process\ncould be put in place where there was an appellate panel\nthat would be willing and available to hear that while the\njury remained empaneled, I don't think it would run afoul\nof the Double Jeopardy Clause.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But is that necessary? I -- I\nmean, that's what I think is the difficult question here.\nCan you say that it's final for purposes of the decision-\nmaker outside that courtroom, namely an appellate court,\nbut it's not final in respect to the judge having a right\nto change his mind within the court? That -- that makes a\nlot of sense to me, but I don't know if it's possible to\nget there.\nWhy not? I -- I think, well, the reason is that\nyou want judges to be able to reconsider things and you\ndon't have that problem when you're talking about an\nappeal.\nMS. NEAVES: That is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or is there any -- is there\nany, in other words, to reconcile our case that you're\ntalking about, Smalis?\nMS. NEAVES: The Smalis case?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes.\nMS. NEAVES: I think there are a number of ways\nto reconcile it. Certainly Massachusetts' position is\nthat it's the difference between a bench trial and a jury\ntrial, but there is also no doubt that the case left the\ntrial court and went up on appeal. I think both of those\nfactors are significant.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't -- isn't the\nsignificance supposedly the existence or nonexistence of\nour continuation of the jury panel, going back to Justice\nStevens' question? And what if the -- what if the State\nhad a procedure whereby the trial judge would simply\ndecline to discharge the jury panel if an appeal were\ntaken from the acquittal motion so that if he was tipped\nover, it could come right back to the same jury panel?\nWould -- would the -- would the answer have to be\ndifferent?\nMS. NEAVES: I don't think it would.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why?\nMS. NEAVES: I think -- I think for a -- I think\nfor my -- to my way of thinking about the cases, the jury\nis what matters and it's the defendant's right to his\nparticular tribunal, and that's the first jury that's\nempaneled --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but on my hypothesis he's\ngoing to get the same jury.\nMS. NEAVES: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They have not been discharged.\nMS. NEAVES: Exactly. So I would say that it\nwould not be a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause,\nand that's why --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wow. It goes all the way up on\nappeal and the jury -- I -- I don't know what the -- I\nguess he lets the jury go home for a couple of months or\nwhile the appeal is pending and then when the decision is\noverturned by the court of appeals, he comes back and\nrecommences the trial? Wow.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. If that's so, then\nwhy shouldn't Smalis have gone the other way? Because\nthey can send it right back to exactly the same judge.\nMS. NEAVES: Because he -- he is the trier of\nfact, and I think at that point --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the jury is the trier of\nfact.\nMS. NEAVES: That's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, on the hypothesis\nbefore, you're saying if they don't discharge the jury and\nit can go back to them, no double jeopardy problem. In\nSmalis, it's going to be the same judge. It was a bench\ntrial. It should have come out the other way.\nMS. NEAVES: Well, I think the difference is the\n-- the judge in Smalis was the trier of fact. He made a\nrule -- he is both the trier of fact and the law-giver.\nHe's decided that the evidence is insufficient. If that\ncase goes up on appeal, that is -- that is factual -- that\nis oversight of his factual determination in essence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it ordinarily true --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is another -- is another\ndifference -- and I don't know if this -- is another\ndifference that in the hypothetical case with the jury,\nthe jury has not yet deliberated --\nMS. NEAVES: Thank you.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- in order to consider the\nfacts.\nMS. NEAVES: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Whereas in your --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- your case, the -- the judge\nis -- is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- apparently deliberating --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is it not true that in this --\nMS. NEAVES: That's where I was headed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- in this case the judge did\nnot reconsider until the end of the defense case?\nMS. NEAVES: That is correct, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, during that period, did\nthe defense lawyer have the right to rely on the acquittal\nin deciding whether or not to put in defensive evidence on\nthe count from which he thought his client had been\nacquitted?\nMS. NEAVES: Well, he certainly had some sense\nof reliance, but it wasn't a double jeopardy reliance.\nAnd I would -- I would point the Court to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, if the Double\nJeopardy Clause did apply, if it were treated as a true\nacquittal, he could just say, well, we can forget about\nthat, send your witnesses home, we won't have to worry\nabout it.\nI understand under your view they could send the\nwitnesses home, and a week -- a week later the judge could\nsay, well, we haven't submitted it to the jury, I've\ndecided to change my mind. You could bring all those\nwitnesses back. That's the way you think it should work.\nMS. NEAVES: Absolutely, Justice Stevens. And I\nthink --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What -- what about a judge who\nthinks -- should the judge -- should a judge in trial be\nable to change his mind as long as the jury is still\nthere? Yes.\nMS. NEAVES: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Should you be able to take an\nappeal in the same circumstance while the jury is still\nthere? No.\nNow, suppose a judge thinks both those things.\nIs that judge, like me, for example, hopelessly confused?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is the judge thinking\ncontradictory things or is there a way of reconciling\nthose two instincts?\nMS. NEAVES: I -- Justice Breyer, I -- I\ncertainly believe that the -- that the double jeopardy\nrule that we're -- we're advocating would permit that, but\nI -- I think that most trial judges would not be very\npleased about doing something like that. And practically\nspeaking, there's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: By the way, if it's\nconstitutional, it's pretty easy to see a State might well\nsay, let's do that, what a good idea. I mean, they might\nthink it's a good idea. I don't know what people think is\na good idea. We'll provide for interlocutory appeals\nright in the middle of cases because the prosecution can\nnever appeal at the end of the case. That's really\nunfair. And we'll do this little thing here, and that way\nwe give the prosecutor a chance.\nMS. NEAVES: I -- I have to stick with the rule\nthat -- that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. You think it's --\nI'm just inconsistent.\nMS. NEAVES: I think it -- I -- well, it's --\nit's -- I think if -- I think if you accept the notion\nthat jury discharge is what matters for purposes of the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause and permitting a trial judge to\nreconsider a legal ruling up to that point, then if a\nState court could fashion an interlocutory review process\nof that legal ruling, that would not violate the Double\nJeopardy Clause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is the conceptual basis\nfor saying that jury discharge makes the difference? Why\nis that the touchstone?\nMS. NEAVES: I think this Court has said over\nand over again that it is the jury -- the defendant's\nright to hold onto his chosen jury that matters in a\nnumber of different contexts in the double jeopardy area.\nThis Court has drawn the line at attachment of jeopardy\nwhen the jury is empaneled and sworn based on the\nhistorical value of a defendant having that particular\njury resolve the government's case against him. And so I\nthink that it matters, particularly where a motion for a\nrequired finding is not constitutionally mandated. It's a\ntool that --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I would think prejudice to\nthe defendant should be a factor, and if the defendant is\nmisled by what the judge says into not putting on part of\nthe case that otherwise would have been put on, that's a\npretty serious matter.\nMS. NEAVES: That is a very serious matter, and\nit is the sort of prejudice that falls within the rubric\nof due process and -- and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but we usually don't use --\nMS. NEAVES: -- would grant you a retrial.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- we don't use the -- I mean,\nyou could use the Due Process Clause for everything, for\ndouble jeopardy, for all of the other protections in the\nConstitution. I think our cases say if -- if there's a\nproblem that has been created by ignoring the double\njeopardy rules, you don't solve that problem by -- by the\ndeus ex machina of the Due Process Clause.\nMS. NEAVES: No. That's -- that's exactly\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So this a problem created by\nthe judge's dismissal, and which this defendant had every\nreason to rely upon as being the end of that part of the\ncase. I'm inclined to say if -- if that is a problem, in\nfairness it's a -- it's a double jeopardy problem, not a\ndue process problem.\nMS. NEAVES: Well, with respect, Justice Scalia,\nI would say it is the sort of reliance that a -- that a\ndefendant may have, as for example the case in Sanabria,\nwhere a -- where a judge excludes certain evidence, and\nthe case goes forward. And as a result of that -- a\nresult of that decision, the judge in that case granted a\nmotion for acquittal. And at the end of the case, the\nprosecution asked for reconsideration of the exclusion of\nthe evidence, and the judge ultimately determined not to\ngo ahead and let that evidence back in, but specifically\nsaid if I had let it back in, I would have vacated my\nmotion for required finding and allowed the case to go to\nthe jury. So that sort of prejudice -- a defendant has an\nexpectation of certain things that may or may not happen\nat trial, but the remedy outside of the double jeopardy\ncontext, if the defendant is acquitted, is a retrial.\nThe drastic remedy of double jeopardy is -- is\nused when a defendant has been subjected twice to a trial\nbefore a second trier of fact. This -- this Court has\nbeen consistent that when the government subjects the\ndefendant over and over again before a second --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand you correctly\nto say that if the defendant is acquitted, the remedy is a\nretrial?\nMS. NEAVES: No, no, no. I'm sorry, Justice\nStevens. No. Only if the defendant is convicted is the\nremedy a retrial because, indeed, if the jury acquits him,\nthere is no harm at all.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the reason you didn't\nwant a fairly simple rule that I was thinking of? I'll\ntell you what it is and you'll tell me honestly why you\ndon't.\nIt's final. The word acquittal is -- is final\nif the jury has been discharged or the decision is sent to\nanother body for review. One or the other.\nMS. NEAVES: I could live with that rule.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, so you haven't found\nsomething in your research that suggests that -- that --\nMS. NEAVES: No, no. Our position has been\nconsistent.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under -- under that view\nof things, suppose in this -- in this case there's a\nmotion for acquittal and the judge says, yes, I -- I think\nthere's no evidence on the gun. Then the prosecutor says\nI want 10 minutes because I think there's a case on it.\nThen he says, you know, there's a case and I think it\ncovers this, and the judge says, well, I think you may be\nwrong. I'll let you reopen to put on evidence of -- of\nthe gun. What would -- what would be the result in that\ncase?\nMS. NEAVES: I think that because if it's a jury\ntrial and the case is still -- and the jury is still\nthere, it could be done without violating the Double\nJeopardy Clause.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think you have to say that\nunder your view.\nMS. NEAVES: I think so. I think honing -- what\nthis Court has talked about in honing is -- is refining a\ncase before a second trier of fact. And as a matter of\nMassachusetts' procedures, certainly the prosecution may\nbe able to reopen if there's good faith or mistake, but\nfor purposes of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why did the\nMassachusetts Supreme Court say -- and I thought it did\nsay this in its rules -- trial judge, you rule on the spot\nwhen a motion to acquit is made? We will not allow you to\nreserve judgment. Because the normal thing would be a\ntrial judge would say, why should I decide this\ndefinitively now? I'll wait till the end of the case.\nBut as I understand the Massachusetts rules, it says,\njudge, you can't reserve on a motion to acquit. You must\nrule immediately.\nMS. NEAVES: That is correct, Justice Ginsburg,\nand if I misunderstood the hypothetical, that -- that was\nmy mistake. As a matter of Massachusetts law, a trial\njudge does not have that option. She must rule on the\nmotion before the defendant decides to put on the case,\nand that is what happened here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- so part of Justice\nBreyer's question needs editing because it would not be\npossible under Massachusetts law for the judge to say --\nMS. NEAVES: That is correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I reserve.\nMS. NEAVES: That is correct. She could not.\nAnd -- and if I could just highlight a couple of\npoints to -- to demonstrate the significance of -- of\npermitting trial judges the ability to reconsider legal\nrulings. In Massachusetts, the fact that there's a\nwritten motion here is quite unusual. These motions are\nmade orally generally. The prosecution is not given an\nopportunity -- does not -- there's no requirement that he\nbe given advance notice ever. There's no requirement of\nthat. The prosecution argues in opposition to the motion\non the spot, and the judge rules on the spot.\nAnd -- and I think that -- that procedure is\ndemonstrated quite clearly here. The -- the defendant\nfiled the motion. The prosecution did, indeed, argue the\ncorrect response, legal response, did not have a case at\nhand and as --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Your position would be the same\nif the -- if the Massachusetts law provided that the\nmotions at the end of the prosecution's case shall not be\nruled on unless -- after they're written briefs filed by\nboth sides and they have 3 days of argument. You'd still\nhave the same position.\nMS. NEAVES: That's true.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And in fact, the -- the quick\nand dirty procedure you describe is probably a boon to\nprosecutors because a judge is -- is not likely to take\nthe serious step of dismissing a charge on the basis of --\nof such a procedure and is more likely to say, well, we'll\nlet the trial go ahead and see what the evidence\ndiscloses. I mean, I can't imagine that this is not a\nboon to the prosecutor rather than, as you -- as you seem\nto paint it here, a disadvantage.\nMS. NEAVES: I -- I wouldn't want to\ncharacterize --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is a very unusual judge I\nwould think to --\nMS. NEAVES: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to whip it out like that and\n-- and enter an acquittal without -- without letting it go\nforward.\nMS. NEAVES: I would say it is unusual, but it\nhappens where -- and I think the trial judge certainly in\nthis case who believes that if she's mistaken, can -- can\ncorrect her ruling and send it to the jury, then feels\nsomewhat free to -- to do what the defendant asks, if it\nseems reasonable, and -- and knows that if -- if it can be\ncorrected --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You may -- you may regret what\nyou've asked for.\nMS. NEAVES: I hope not, Justice Scalia. I hope\nnot.\nI think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What would happen -- I think\none of the briefs suggested that suppose you have a multi-\ndefendant case and the judge says, after the prosecution\ncase is done, defendant A, I'm going to grant a motion to\nacquit. He's out of it, but there was enough evidence to\nrequire the -- the defense to go on for B and C. And then\nafter hearing B and C's defense, the judge said, I think I\nwas wrong about acquitting A, so I'm -- I'm going to\nwithdraw it. Would there be -- could that be done without\nany -- any double jeopardy bar? The jury hasn't been\ndischarged.\nMS. NEAVES: Justice Ginsburg, I don't think it\npresents a double jeopardy bar, but a defendant has a\nright to be present at his trial, and so it certainly\nwould be a reversible error if -- if a trial judge --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the -- the -- he's\nsitting there. Defendant A is sitting there throughout\nthe whole trial.\nMS. NEAVES: Then there's certainly no double\njeopardy bar to that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There could be a problem that\nyou have to have a fair chance to present evidence and so\nforth.\nMS. NEAVES: Absolutely, Justice Breyer, and --\nand --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I guess there are a lot of\nrules in Massachusetts that deal with that. They can't --\nyou have to be fair to the defendant in -- is that right?\nMS. NEAVES: Well, certainly. Rule 25 itself\nspecifically states that the defendant shall have the\nopportunity to present evidence after the motion is denied\nor allowed in part without reserving that right. So\ncertainly that option is available.\nUnless the Court has further questions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Neaves.\nMS. NEAVES: Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. -- Mr. Srinivasan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe trial court in this case was permitted to\ncorrect its erroneous ruling in favor of the defendant on\nthe motion for judgment of acquittal. Because the\nprosecution is entitled to a full and fair opportunity to\nprove its case, that's a value --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you the same\nquestion I asked your -- your colleague? Supposing we're\nnot in Massachusetts, but we're in another State that\nprovided for an interlocutory appeal immediately after the\njudge's ruling in this case. Would -- would you have the\nsame appraisal of the case on those facts?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Would we have the same\nappraisal as the State? We don't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. Would you still say it\nwas not final, even though it was sufficiently final for\nappellate purposes?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No. We -- we think that the\nCourt's holding in Smalis applies equally to jury trials\nand to bench trials such that an appeal, an interlocutory\nappeal, in the midst of a jury trial would not be\npermissible. But we also think that there is a sound\nbasis for drawing a distinction between --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But my question is assuming a\nState procedure in which the interlocutory appeal was\npermissible, you -- you would say Double Jeopardy Clause\nwould bar that appeal.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right, because we read that to\nbe the holding of Smalis.\nBut we think there's a basis for distinguishing\nbetween appeals on one hand and continuing proceedings\nbefore the initial tribunal on the other hand. First of\nall, this Court has drawn that distinction in Swisher v.\nBrady where it initially said that the two-stage system of\nadjudication is -- in Maryland that was at issue in that\ncase was permissible because it entailed continued\nproceedings before the initial tribunal rather than an\nappeal to a second tribunal. And the Court specifically\ndistinguished its prior decisions in Jenkins v. the United\nStates and Kepner, both of which involved appellate\nreview.\nAnd the other basis for drawing a distinction\nbetween appeals on one hand and reconsiderations by the\ntrial court on the other is historical tradition. I think\nthe Court could look to history and history would show\nthat on one hand trial courts have always had inherent\nauthority to reconsider their mid-trial rulings because\nthe practical exigencies of trial are such that trial\ncourts inevitably will err on occasion, and the ends of\njustice require trial courts to have the authority to\nrevisit their mid-trial rulings.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would -- would you allow a\ntrial judge to reopen -- to -- to permit the prosecution\nto reopen the case?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: We would, Justice Kennedy, but\nit raises a distinct problem because one value that's\nserved by the Double Jeopardy Clause is the defendant's\ninterest in preventing the prosecution from honing its\nevidentiary case by repeated efforts. And if the trial\njudge were permitted to reopen the case to give the\nprosecution that opportunity, it at least would implicate\nthat interest.\nNow, we still think that the proper line is jury\ndischarge, but we understand that that hypothetical would\npresent a distinct interest.\nNow, with respect to historical tradition on\nappeals, the historical tradition is clear that the\ngovernment has lacked authority at common law to take an\nappeal in a criminal proceeding. This Court relied on\nthat common law tradition as early as Sanges v. the United\nStates and it's repeated that understanding in Carroll v.\nthe United States and Arizona v. Manypenny, and that's why\nthe Court construes statutory grants of authority to the\ngovernment to take an appeal in criminal cases quite\nnarrowly. And so I think the Court could draw a\ndistinction between reconsiderations by the trial court\nand appeals by looking to historical tradition, and the\nCourt often looks at history to shape the contours of\ndouble jeopardy protections. And that would afford the\ncase -- the Court a basis for saying that in Smalis, while\nappeals were forbidden, in this case trial court\nreconsideration should be permitted.\nAnd I think the lens through which the Court\nwould do that under the Double Jeopardy Clause is the\nvalued interest in giving the prosecution one full and\nfair opportunity to prove its case in the sense that while\nthat full and fair opportunity may exclude an appeal,\nbecause the Court held as much in Smalis, it doesn't\nexclude reconsiderations.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why doesn't the -- the\nprosecution gets its full and fair opportunity if we have\na rule that says to trial judges, when you make a ruling\non acquittal, you better be serious and you better not\nmake a snap judgment, think it over, because once you've\ndone it, it sticks? Why -- why doesn't the prosecution\nhave a perfectly fair opportunity under that rule?\nEverybody knows where he stands and judges, we hope, are\ngoing to be careful.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Souter, we think a\nconstitutional rule that would turn on the definitiveness\nof a trial court ruling would be flawed in three respects.\nFirst, the line between a definitive ruling and\na tentative ruling is not altogether clear, and we've\noutlined in our brief at page 24 in a lengthy footnote a\nvariety of factual scenarios that come from real cases\nwhere trial judges, as they often do, rendered a ruling on\na motion for acquittal orally, and whether you think that\nruling was definitive or tentative might depend on which\npage of the transcript you happen to be looking at.\nBut even if we're dealing with a situation in\nwhich the ruling clearly falls on the definitive side of\nthe line, you'd still have the problem that a trial court\nmight be convinced that it's correct and rule definitively\nbut still be incorrect. Trial courts make mistakes.\nThat's why this issue comes up as often as it does. For\nexample, in this case --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: All these cases -- we've\nhad several, not too many over the -- the whole line of\ncases -- and the trial judge has always committed a rather\nplain error. And we all have the case where if you just\ntry to decide whether it's a just result, you'd always say\nno. A case just like this. The judge made a mistake, but\nwe've always said that's not something we -- we look at.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I don't -- I'm not quite sure\nI'm following what you're saying, Justice Stevens,\nbecause --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I say as a typical matter\nthese double jeopardy claims arise in cases in which the\njudge made a rather plain error, and when you look at it\nlater, you say, gee, he goofed. And so I'm not sure we\nshould consider the plainness of the error or the fact\nthat they -- they do mistakes because they do.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: But -- but I don't -- but the\nreason why the Court accepts errors in some situations is\nbecause there's some other value under the Double Jeopardy\nClause.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The value of finality is what\nis really at stake here.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it's not just the value\nof finality. It's that, for example, if the judge makes\nan error and then the jury is discharged, it's the value\nthat the defendant has in obtaining a result from the\nparticular tribunal. In the circumstances of this case,\nwhere the trial judge can correct her error within the --\nwithin a matter of minutes, at least in some situations,\nthere would be no double jeopardy purpose served --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But here it was not a matter\nof minutes.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: In this --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Here it was --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No. I acknowledge in this case\nit wasn't, but it might well be in some cases. For\nexample, we cite a decision of the Washington Supreme\nCourt, State v. Collins, which involves essentially the\nsame scenario as this case, but the only distinction was\nthat after the trial judge initially announced her ruling,\nthe prosecution had the precedent in hand and within a\nspan of 10 minutes, the trial judge was able to realize\nher error and to correct her ruling and reinstate the\ncharge.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does it matter if the -- if\nthe ruling is conveyed to the jury even though the jury\nisn't discharged?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It would matter, Justice\nO'Connor, but I don't think it would necessarily preclude\nthe prosecution from going forward on the charge under the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause. The question would be one of due\nprocess and prejudice to the defendant.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You had three -- three reasons\nyou were going to give Justice Souter. One is it's not\nclear always that it's definitive. The other is that\ntrial judges do make mistakes, and the third is?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: And the third is -- it's an\nissue that you raised earlier, Justice Kennedy. It's that\nthis case might look different as an atmospheric matter if\nthe trial judge at the time she rendered her ruling had\nsaid, I'm ruling in the defendant's favor, but I may\nreconsider this decision at a later point in the\nproceedings. Now, that might be seen to fall on the\ntentative side of the line, but that's exactly the effect\nof this -- of the trial judge's ruling as a matter of\nMassachusetts law. And we don't think there's a\nconstitutionally significant distinction between a trial\njudge explicitly saying that a ruling can be reconsidered\nand State law saying that the ruling can be reconsidered.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't the distinction the\nright to rely?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It -- there -- there -- that\nwould be the basis of a claim, Justice Souter, but the\nright to rely is, in essence, a notice prejudice sort of\nclaim and that could be handled in the way that trial\ncourts typically handle claims by the defendant that\nthey've detrimentally relied on an initial ruling the\ntrial court has subsequently reconsidered.\nIt would be equally the case, for example, as\nthe State mentioned with respect to an evidentiary ruling\nthat barred the prosecution from introducing a category of\nevidence, but then the trial judge, later in the\nproceedings, wanted to revisit that ruling. The question\nwould be whether revisiting the ruling resulted in\nprejudice to the defendant because the defendant had\ndetrimentally relied on the trial judge's initial\ndetermination. And we don't think that prejudice inquiry\nis meaningfully different when you're dealing with\nevidentiary rulings as when you're -- as when you're\ndealing with the reinstatement of a previously acquitted\ncharge.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why shouldn't you have\n-- what's magic about the jury? Why shouldn't you have\nthe same rule on a bench trial? A judge in a bench trial\nmakes a ruling, thinks about it, and says, you know, I\nshouldn't have ruled that way. Why shouldn't that judge\nbe able to change? Just because there's no jury to\ndischarge.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it would depend. If --\nif the bench trial judge were making a mid-trial ruling,\nas -- as in this case, then the judge could change his or\nher mind. But if the bench trial judge were resolving the\nentire case and entered --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what is the line? I\nmean, is there -- there no point at which he can't change?\nI mean --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No. The -- the -- I think the\nConstitution would step in and impose a line at some\npoint, and probably the best indicator is a rule --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it's not dismissal of the\njury. We'll have to make up some other line. Right?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It can't be discharge of the\njury, but I think where the Court would look, first and\nforemost, in defining a line for bench trials, if the\nissue would ever arise, would be a ruling that would\nessentially have resulted in discharge of the jury if the\ntrial were before a jury. And for example, the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But how do we -- how does\nSmalis fit into this discussion? I thought in Smalis in a\nbench trial, we said it was final.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It was, Justice O'Connor, for\npurposes of an appeal, and that's why I think the critical\ndistinction between Smalis and this case is that where the\nprosecution might not have authority to take an appeal\nfrom a ruling on the insufficiency of the evidence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your line would be something\nlike if it -- if -- from all of the transcript, it appears\nthat the judge is -- is giving consideration to the entire\ncase or something like that in a bench trial.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: In a bench trial, that -- that\nwould be part of the inquiry, Justice Kennedy, and I would\nalso point, by the way, to -- can I just finish the\nthought, Justice Stevens? To Federal Rule of Criminal\nProcedure 32(k)(1), which says that when a bench trial --\nwhen a judge sitting in a bench trial issues a ruling that\nfinds a defendant not guilty, that ruling will discharge\nthe defendant. And I think a discharge of the defendant\nwould be one of critical consideration.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you.\nMr. Nathanson, you have about 3 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. NATHANSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. NATHANSON: Justice Stevens, may it please\nthe Court:\nI'll try to be as brief as I can.\nThe argument about inherent authority to\nreconsider an acquittal really has it backwards. Inherent\nauthority bends to the Constitution. The Constitution\ndoes not bend to a judge's inherent authority.\nSecond, the -- the Government is trying to\nsubstitute a standard here of a second proceeding, which\nis not this Court's standard. This Court's standard is\nfurther proceedings after an acquittal, including\nresumption of the same trial. That's what this Court said\nin Smalis.\nThe Government is also trying to move this case\ninto the particular tribunal analysis. That comes from\ncases that are mistrials. This is an acquittal. This is\nnot a particular tribunal case.\nAs to the judge resolving all the issues in a\nbench trial and -- and that's why that -- that acquittal\nwould be more final than a motion for a directed verdict,\nit was a motion for a directed verdict. It was a demurrer\nin Smalis. It was the exact same standard that the judge\napplied in that case.\nAs to prejudice, prejudice has never been a\nfactor in this Court's double jeopardy analysis. As a\nmatter of fact, in -- in one of the really classical\nstatements, Ex parte Lange, if you look at the facts of\nthat case, that looks like complete gamesmanship. The\ndefendant was sentenced to a jail term and a fine when the\n-- the statute only authorized a jail term or a fine. He\nsaid, oh, I'll pay -- I'll pay the fine. It's a get-out-\nof-jail-free card. There's complete gamesmanship, but\nprejudice was not a factor. And in fact, this Court has\nsaid prejudice is not open to judicial examination in\ndouble jeopardy cases.\nAs to honing, in -- in fact, in Rumsey --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Honing?\nMR. NATHANSON: Honing. Not the name of a case,\nYour Honor. But whether or not the Government has honed\nits cased through -- and -- and they would say evidentiary\nhoning. But it's not evidentiary honing. In Rumsey, it\nwas only argument that was presented at -- at the remand\nafter acquittal.\nJustice Souter, I want to heartily endorse the\n-- the way you phrased what the rule should be, which is,\ntrial judges, you ought to take this seriously.\nPretermitting the prosecution's case is a very serious\nmatter. You cannot take it back. So think about it. Do\nit right the first time.\nAs to -- to rule 25 itself, it's true that the\n-- the judges can't reserve. So what they do as -- as a\nmatter of practice in Massachusetts is they simply deny,\nand -- and they deny the first one and they have two more\nopportunities, one at the close of the defendant's case\nand they have an opportunity at the close of -- after the\njury has returned a verdict. At each of those steps, they\ncan make a motion for acquittal.\nAs to the full and fair opportunity, this Court\nsaid in Martin Linen that the Government has a right to\ntry the case. They do not have a right to have it proceed\nto verdict. I'm just taking that straight from Martin\nLinen.\nAs to, finally, whether or not State law sort of\ninsulates this from Federal -- I see my time is up. Thank\nyou.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Nathanson, thank you.\n"
