        "content": "(10:59 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument in Johnson\nagainst California.\nMr. Deixler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BERT H. DEIXLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DEIXLER: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThis case presents the issue of whether the\nCalifornia Department of Corrections, unlike every other\nState in the Federal Bureau of Prisons, may continue its\nmore than 28-year, unexamined practice of routine, blanket\nracial segregation of its prisoners.\nThe unitary practice in question here was\napplied more than 350,000 times last year, not just to the\n40,000 new prisoners entering the California system, but\nto all 72,000 returning parolees and hundreds of thousands\nof transfer prisoners such as the petitioner in this case,\nGarrison Johnson, a petitioner who had been housed for\nmore than 15 years in the California prison system. This\nunexamined, routine practice effectively erected whites\nonly, blacks only, Hispanics only signs over the portals\nof the California prison system, and it is a practice\nwhich is routed in racial stereotype and the belief that\nall persons of a race think alike and act alike.\nCalifornia's needless and dangerous policy fails\nboth the strict scrutiny test, which the Ninth Circuit\nshould have applied, and the Turner deference standard,\nwhich the Ninth Circuit wrongly applied.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is California the only State,\nto your knowledge, to apply this procedure?\nMR. DEIXLER: Yes, Justice O'Connor, it is.\nThe --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the statistics showed\nthat there were -- I'm sorry. I don't have it right at my\nfingerprints -- fingertips -- only about 200,000\nprocessing incidents a year, 200,000 people a year to be\nprocessed. I take it that includes some people that are\nbeing transferred?\nMR. DEIXLER: Yes, correct, Your Honor. In --\nin the circumstances in this case, Petitioner Johnson, for\nexample, during his 15 years, had been transferred on five\nseparate occasions, and the circumstances which he\nexperienced are not unusual within the California prison\nsystem. Indeed, an outside-the-record fact: within the\nlast three weeks, he's been informed that he's to be\ntransferred yet again within the California prison system\nto another facility called Corcoran.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May -- may I put aside for a\nmoment the question of the strength of your argument in\ntransfer situations and simply go to the circumstances of\nthe original receipt of the prisoner for the first time\ninto the prison system? What do the other States -- you\nsay California is the only one that -- that makes this\nracial assignment like this. What do the other States do\nto guard against an -- an explosive team-up in -- in\ndouble-celled prisoners when -- when they're taking them\nin for the first time?\nMR. DEIXLER: The circumstances in other States,\nwhich we've been able to identify, include a range of --\nof circumstances, which include -- as is available in\nCalifornia under the penal code section, which requires\nthe delivery of a presentence report, together with a\ncommitment order, is analysis on a particularized\ncircumstance basis of the individuals who are coming into\nthe prison and making a -- an estimate as to what may\noccur. Other States use a random assignment circumstance,\nand giving no consideration whatever to race. And a third\ngroup of States apparently consider race as part of an\noverall or holistic bit of analysis with regard to trying\nto equalize the prison populations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know if there are in\nthese other States the same incidents of racial riots or\nracial killings or racial attacks?\nMR. DEIXLER: Well, the best empirical evidence\nwhich exists that we're familiar with was reported in the\nTrulson study, which the dissenters in the Ninth Circuit\npetition for rehearing en banc relied upon and which the\namici have filed with this Court. And in that\ncircumstance, it suggests, over a 10-year study in Texas,\nthat only five percent of all of the interracial -- of -- of\nall of the incidents of violence in -- in the Texas prison\nsystem were what was described by Professor Trulson as\nhaving racial motivations. And of that five percent, only\none-quarter, or about 1.2 percent, were interracial\ncircumstances where there had been interracial cellmates\ninvolved in the racial violence. And that seems to be, as\nfar as anyone has been able to produce in this case in any\npart of the record, the best empirical data which might\nrespond to your question, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Were there any incidents in\nCalifornia's prisons of same cellmates of different races\nhaving episodes of violence? Or -- this is an old policy.\nSo were there incidents like that that led to the\ndevelopment of the policy?\nMR. DEIXLER: Justice Ginsburg, one of the\ninteresting things about the record in this case is that\nthe State of California has been unable to identify a\nsingle incident of a -- of interracial violence between\ncellmates. The record is bereft of that kind of\ninformation. Rather, they've spoken of information about\nviolence which occurs in more --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they say that that proves\nthat their policy is very effective. I mean, that's --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DEIXLER: I think the -- I think the record\nsuggests, as at least in the testimony of Mr. Johnson,\nthat it is a de facto segregation system which exists\nafter the 60-day period and outside the transfer 60-day\nperiod, and so it would be hard for the State of\nCalifornia to provide -- to provide that data.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you were to prevail in\nthis case and a court were to enter a decree forbidding\nthis practice. A month later, there is an incident in\nwhich one prisoner is seriously injured in a -- in a\nprison cell because of the interracial assignment policy.\nWould that be grounds for rethinking the decree?\nMR. DEIXLER: Well, Justice Kennedy, it seems to\nme that under the Court's strict scrutiny analysis, which\nin my judgment should have applied here, and under the\nparticularized circumstance test announced in the Lee case\nin the concurrence, that a circumstance involving a single\nprisoner in a single prison cell on one occasion ought not\nto give rise to a systematic change in -- in a policy\nwhich is rooted in racial stereotype. With regard to\nthose prisoners involved in that particular circumstance,\nof course, some period of -- of segregation would be\nappropriate as a means of controlling and ensuring that\nthere's not going to be some kind of wholesale racial\nviolence. That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is -- what is sacrosanct\nabout the -- about the constitutional right not to be\nsubjected to racial stereotype? There are a lot of other\nconstitutional rights that people in prison give up.\nThat's one of the consequences of committing a crime and\nbeing sent to prison, the most fundamental constitutional\nright, the right to -- to walk around and -- and not be\nseized. Why -- why is it that this -- this one\nconstitutional right cannot yield to what prison\nauthorities believe is -- is a useful, not necessarily\nessential, but a useful means of -- of maintaining order\nin prison?\nMR. DEIXLER: Well, Justice Scalia, the\nfundamental teachings on the Fourteenth Amendment of this\nCourt demonstrate that race is different, that the\ngovernment use of race is presumed to be unlawful --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, it's -- it's different from\nFirst Amendment rights? Prisoners can't hold news\nconferences. I mean, there are all sorts of very\nimportant constitutional rights that I think are no more\nimportant than the Equal Protection Clause which prisoners\nyield when they're in prison.\nNow, do we subject the taking away of all of\nthese rights to strict scrutiny when the prison\nauthorities do it? I don't think so. I think we say if\nit's -- if it's the judgment of the -- of the prison\nauthorities, we -- we generally defer to it.\nMR. DEIXLER: Yes. The Turner standard\ncertainly reflects a consideration by this Court that\ndeference is appropriate with regard to rights which are\ninconsistent with incarceration.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, even First Amendment\nrights.\nMR. DEIXLER: Even First Amendment rights.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Isn't that so?\nMR. DEIXLER: Yes, Justice O'Connor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Which is a terribly important\nset of rights for individuals, is it not?\nMR. DEIXLER: Yes. The First Amendment rights\nare very important.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right.\nMR. DEIXLER: However, in the context of\nincarceration, a sacrifice of the right to assembly, the\nright to correspond in certain circumstances, to contact\nvisits are things which are well within the ambit of what\na prison needs to control.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I don't think so. I -- why\nwould holding a news conference disrupt a prison? It\nwouldn't. You say it's too much trouble. We don't want\nnews conferences in prison.\nMR. DEIXLER: And in -- and in the circumstances\nthat the Court's test has been announced in Turner, that's\ncertainly within the ambit of a right which the prison\nauthorities might properly exercise.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And why is this not one?\nMR. DEIXLER: Well, because this Court\ndecided --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because it -- it is no -- there\nis no doubt that there are racial gangs in prison, the\nAryan Brotherhood and -- and Hispanic gangs and -- and\nblack gangs. There's no doubt that that exists. Is it --\nMR. DEIXLER: There's no doubt -- Justice\nScalia, there's no doubt that there are racial gangs in\nprison, but this policy of California is directed not to\nthe gang aspect of it but to the race aspect. The record\nis clear that there's a near zero percent chance that any\nblack person could be housed with any white person, that\nany white person could be housed with any Hispanic person,\nwithout reference to the gang question. And this is a\ntransfer policy which recurs and recurs, five times in the\ncase of -- of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Deixler, do you think you\nlose if we apply Turner?\nMR. DEIXLER: No, Your Honor. We believe that\neven under Turner --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why isn't that the right\napproach to the case then if that's the -- we don't have\nto meddle with the rules governing the -- the conduct of\nprisons, if you can prevail under that theory?\nMR. DEIXLER: We would -- we would be pleased to\n-- to prevail under -- under Turner, Justice Stevens. It\nseems that consistent with the Court's teachings under the\nFourteenth Amendment and the most recent considerations by\nthe Court of equal protection and strict scrutiny, that\nthe use of race by California in this context should\ntrigger a strict scrutiny analysis, should lead to an\nanalysis of whether there has been narrow tailoring. But\nunder the Turner test, we believe properly applied, the\npetitioner should prevail as well.\nUnder the Turner test, it seems that at least\ntwo of the four elements which are announced in Turner\ncouldn't possibly be met here. The first one is it seems\nto be no -- there is no reasonable relationship between\nthe government regulation which is at issue and the\nannounced policy. The notion that one can determine by\nrace alone a violent propensity seems irrational,\nunreasonable, and contrary to the only empirical evidence\nwhich exists, the Trulson study.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you have a population\nin which 50 percent of all the members of a particular\nrace are a member of a -- of a gang, a gang such as we've\nread about in -- in the record, Bloods, Crips, et cetera.\n50 percent are members of the gang. Would that allow you\nto segregate?\nMR. DEIXLER: No, I don't think such a\nstatistic --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is that because you\ndon't equate race gangs with race animosity?\nMR. DEIXLER: Well, in fact, in part that's\ncorrect, Justice Kennedy. The -- the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- because it does seem to\nme that part of your submission, or at least an inference\nthat I drew, was that race-based gangs do not constitute\nrace-based threats. Am I right in saying that that's your\nsubmission?\nMR. DEIXLER: Without more, Justice Kennedy,\nthat inference cannot be drawn, and I'll give the Court\nthe example of the Crips and the Bloods --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean the inference that\nthe -- which inference? That they are or are not a\nthreat?\nMR. DEIXLER: That they are not to the extent\nthat, Justice Kennedy, you're asking whether it is an\ninterracial threat. It is -- it is undoubtedly true,\ntaking the example of the Crips and the Bloods, that they\nare intra-racial threats, and indeed prison policy directed\ntowards separating Crips and Bloods because of the -- of\nthe intraracial problem is certainly one which would be\nsomething that the -- the prison system should address.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- assume that a gang poses an\ninterracial threat?\nMR. DEIXLER: The -- there's no evidence which\nhas been produced in this record which would suggest that\nthe policy can be tied from skin color to gang membership\nand from gang membership to interracial violence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I asked -- I asked about\ngang membership. Can gang membership be equated with an\ninterracial threat in any significant number of -- of\ngangs?\nMR. DEIXLER: Not in the record of this case,\nJustice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- you -- you don't\nneed it in the record. You -- you know what the Aryan\nBrotherhood is. It -- it is a white group that is hostile\nto blacks in particular, and you know what the Bloods are.\nIt is a black group that -- that is hostile to whites.\nAnd -- and does it take any more than common sense to know\nthat if you put a tattooed member of one group in with a\ntattooed member of the other group, the likelihood of\nviolence in that cell is going to be greater? And is any\nmore than that needed for -- for the -- for the prison not\nto cell them together?\nWould you acknowledge that at least if the --\nnot just on the basis that one is white and one is black,\nbut if the prison knows that -- that one is a member of\nthe Aryan Brotherhood and the other is a member of the\nBloods, the prison can refuse to -- to assign them to the\nsame cell?\nMR. DEIXLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Now -- now suppose\n-- I didn't mean to intrude on Justice Breyer, but just\nfollowing this question, suppose that 50 percent of all\nthe inmate population in a particular small prison is a\nmember of one of these gangs. Then could you segregate on\naccount of race?\nMR. DEIXLER: I think on race alone, the prison\nsystem would run afoul of the Constitution in making that\ndetermination. If it -- if race were analyzed in the\ncontext of gang membership, as part of an overall analysis\nof proclivity to violence based upon a series of facts\nexisting in that prison, particularized circumstances, as\nsuggested in the Lee case, I think that would be a proper\nanalysis and constitutional. It's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, would it be a proper\nanalysis simply to -- to separate or not based on gang\nmembership?\nMR. DEIXLER: Yes, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. Your answer to Justice\nScalia stands on that. So you would not be making an\nargument that gang membership is merely a surrogate for\nrace in that case if that were the policy.\nMR. DEIXLER: Yes. In that particular case,\ngang membership is not a surrogate for race. In the\nCalifornia policy, race is a surrogate for gang\nmembership.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. DEIXLER: I'd like to reserve the balance of\nmy --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I -- may I ask just one\nquestion? I understand the -- your position that Turner\nis enough to cover this, but you're going-in position was\nthat race is different, even different than the First\nAmendment. And you gave one other example, the Eighth\nAmendment. It may be convenient, make things easier for\nthe administration of a prison if prisoners are tortured\nevery now and then to keep them in line, but obviously,\nthe Eighth Amendment prevails over that. Is there\nanything else that you say is -- is so fundamental that we\ndon't do it, like torture? And -- and you say race\nsegregation belongs in that category. Anything else?\nMR. DEIXLER: Yes. Well, in this Court's\nopinion in the McKune case under a Fifth Amendment\nanalysis, it was found that that didn't -- it was not\nanalyzed under a Turner standard. And even in the Harper\ncase, before the determination of the liberty right being\ntaken under the Turner standard, the Court relied upon\nprocedural due process rights which were exercised in --\nin the State of Washington with regard to -- to the\nprisoner.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThis case presents the Court with an opportunity\nto reaffirm that all government policies based on race are\nsubject to strict scrutiny. The deference generally owed\nto the sound judgment of prison officials does not require\nthis Court to modify its repeated statements that all\ngovernment action based on race should be subject to\nstrict scrutiny.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We say the same about the First\nAmendment, don't we? All government actions restricting\nspeech are subject to strict scrutiny. Right? And yet,\nwe allow that to occur in prison.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think that this Court has\nrecognized in a variety of contexts, including when they\nhave -- when justices have made reference to prison\npolicies, that all government actions based on race are\nsubject to strict scrutiny.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unlike the First Amendment.\nMR. CLEMENT: The First Amendment obviously has\nbeen subjected, at least when you're talking about things\nother than outgoing prisoner mail, to be subjected to the\nTurner analysis, but note -- this Court has never suggested\nthat the Turner analysis applies to race.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Clement, will you tell us\nhow the Government would come out applying the Turner\nanalysis in this case?\nMR. CLEMENT: Absolutely, Justice Stevens. I\nthink if the Turner analysis is correctly applied in this\ncase, this policy does not even survive Turner analysis.\nI would suggest it's very analogous to the marriage policy\nthat the Court struck down in Turner applying the Turner\nanalysis because there the State identified a concern with\ninmate marriages and particularly with inmate-to-inmate\nmarriages, and yet they adopted a policy that prohibited\nall inmate marriages.\nHere there's a concern that's expressed with\nnewly arriving inmates, about whom California says it\nknows very little. Yet, it applies its policies to\ntransferring inmates, as well as to returning parolees.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And why should we decide the\nconstitutional question?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think either one of those\nwould be a constitutional --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- holding of this Court, and I\nthink either under Turner or under strict scrutiny, it's\nstill equally a constitutional holding. And I think it\nwould send an improper message to suggest that there's\nsome element of government decision-making that is somehow\nexempt from strict scrutiny. I think in a variety of\ncontexts, this Court, where it generally reviews a\ngovernment action deferentially -- take, for example, jury\nselection, peremptory challenges. Take, for example,\nmilitary policy. Take, for example, congressional\ndistricting. Those are all government policies this Court\ngenerally refuse -- reviews under a highly deferential\nstandard. Yet, nonetheless, when it comes to government\npolicies based on race, this Court applies strict\nscrutiny.\nAnd in that sense, I think the racial\ndistricting cases provide a very good example because\nthere, generally, as the Vieth case from last term\nillustrates, this Court is very reluctant to do any review\nof the districting lines that are drawn. Yet, when race\nis identified as being the cause for the lines being\ndrawn, as in Miller against Johnson, this Court emphasizes\nthat strict scrutiny applies.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is -- is there an argument to\nbe made that the reason we make that emphasis and -- and\nan argument for you in this case that there is somehow a\ngreater fragility to -- to the effective standards to\nprevent racial classification than there is to the\npossibility of enforcing speech rights and so on? Is\nthere something to worry about here more than in the case\nof -- of enumerated rights that -- that gets the Turner\nanalysis?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think that's part of it,\nJustice Souter. I think one thing is that particularly\nbecause of the history of this country and the use of --\nof race by governments, including in prisons, there is a\nconcern that all government uses of race must be subjected\nto very heightened scrutiny.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but there's a pretty\nfrightening history about speech restriction too.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, again, I think, though, that\nthere is almost a uniquely pernicious history involving\nrace in this country, and I think, again, it is completely\nwrong to suggest that somehow prisons were exempt from\nthat history. To the contrary. Throughout the Nation\nbefore Brown against Board of Education, it was common for\nprisons to be segregated on the basis of race.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is not a permanent\nsegregation in these California prisons. It's just\ntemporary, isn't it? How long does it last?\nMR. CLEMENT: It lasts 60 days, is the best\nevidence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Until -- until they -- they\nhave assurance that -- that the individuals are -- are not\nmembers of a gang and likely to, in -- in their view,\ncommit racial violence if -- if co-celled with another\nprisoner.\nMR. CLEMENT: With respect, Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If it were permanent, your\nargument about this, you know, this is a long tradition of\nour prisons. We -- we keep the blacks and the whites\nseparate. That -- that's not what they're doing in\nCalifornia. It's a temporary -- it's a temporary measure.\nMR. CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Scalia, in\nLee against Washington, this Court upheld the integration\nnot just of the Alabama prisons, but the Alabama jails,\nand the evidence before the Court there -- and this is\nclear from the three-judge opinion -- is that the average\nstay in the Birmingham city jail was seven to 15 days.\nNonetheless, this Court said that seven to 15 days of\nracial segregation was too much.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but we didn't announce a\nstandard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That was for the whole stay.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, that's true, Justice Souter.\nI mean, I think if you look at Brown against Board of\nEducation itself and you look at the various per curiam\nopinions that this Court issued in the wake of Brown v.\nBoard, I don't think any of those decisions have a\nhallmark of being elaborate about the standard of review\nthat the Court has applied. Nonetheless --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does seven -- what does\nseven to 15 days have to do with anything? It was for\nthe whole stay that they were segregated. The stay may\nhave been short, but the fact that during their entire\nperiod they were segregated showed that there was no other\npurpose to this thing except to keep the races separate.\nWhereas, here, they are kept separate for -- for the time\nwhich the California prison believes it needs in order to\nassure that there won't be violence, and once that\nassurance is given, the races are -- are mixed. That's a\ntotally different situation.\nMR. CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Scalia, I\ndisagree. The entire time these prisoners are kept at the\nreception center, which is a separate part of the facility\nwhere the incoming inmates go, that entire time they are\nsegregated on the basis of race.\nNow, the Bureau of Prisons, for example, has a\nsimilar entry section in its various prisons. It's called\nthe admissions and orientations process, and there, using\nthe presentence reports that are provided for by\nCalifornia law, the Federal officials evaluate prisoners\nand their risk levels and have no need to segregate those\nprisoners on the basis of race.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One of -- one of California's\nresponse said, well, the Feds have mostly income tax\nevaders, maybe some drug dealers, but the State prisoners\nare the real tough guys, the real violent criminals.\nSo --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They have a high class of\nfelons in the Federal prison basically.\nMR. CLEMENT: With respect, Your Honors, that\nmisdescribes the -- the population of the Federal prisons.\nPart of where I think they get off on the wrong step is\nthey do their analysis only on the offense of conviction.\nBut a lot of the individuals in the Federal prisons are,\nsay, for example, convicted felons who are convicted for\nfelony in possession. And the underlying felony that led\nthem to be, say, a 924(c) defendant was a violent felony.\nAnd so we -- there are also agreements by which the Bureau\nof Prisoners, on request from States, will house the\nState's most violent criminals. So I think that's an\nunfair description of what the Bureau of Prisons policy --\nor population looks like.\nAnd I think the fact that the Bureau of Prisons\nand virtually every other State that's looked at this\nissue has found a mechanism to deal with the problem of\nincoming inmates without resorting to race is a powerful\nindication that this kind of use of race is unnecessary.\nAnd the problem with applying Turner, rather\nthan strict scrutiny, I think is well illustrated by this\ncase and this policy. This is a policy that is expressly\nacknowledged to take race into account, and it is nowhere\nwritten down. If you pull the Department of Correction\nmanual for the California prison system, there's a 94-\npage chapter on the classification of inmates. Yet, this\npolicy doesn't appear there. It's an unwritten policy.\nJustice Ginsburg, you asked, well, was this\npolicy introduced in response to specific incidents of\nviolence in a cell. The answer to that is unknowable\nbecause nobody even knows how long this policy has been in\nplace. The official responsible for administering it\nacknowledged it's been in place for 25 years.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why -- why does that affect\nthe Turner analysis? I'm sorry. I don't understand.\nMR. CLEMENT: What I'm suggesting, Justice\nO'Connor, is what the -- the application of Turner to this\npolicy allowed. It's to allow an unwritten policy where\n-- of uncertain origins --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I thought you told us earlier\nit wouldn't survive Turner. I -- I don't understand your\nargument.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, it wouldn't survive a proper\nanalysis under Turner. That is correct. But the -- the\ncourt of appeals here, applying its version of Turner,\nupheld this policy. And I think one way of looking at the\nchoice between Turner and strict scrutiny is whether there\nis a greater threat that frequent judicial approvals of\nprisons' use of race will have the effect of diluting the\nstrict scrutiny rigor or whether frequent disapprovals of\nprisons' use of race will have the effect of undermining\nthe Turner deference. And the concern of the Federal\nGovernment is exactly that, that by having race policies\nevaluated under Turner, there will be a necessary\ntemptation to bump up the Turner analysis in a way that\nstrikes down racial policies.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're concerned about\nevaluating prison race policies. Are there any other\nprison policies in the country that adopt a racial test\nlike that?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think -- I think\nCalifornia -- it's -- it's best described as California is\none of at most a couple of States that have a comparable\ncell-based policy of segregation. And so I think it\nreally is kind of the outlier in terms of that analysis.\nNow, there may be situations -- and we think\nstrict scrutiny can account for them -- where States want\nto take race into account in particularized circumstances.\nAnd I think testing those under strict scrutiny is the\nproper mode of analysis.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Clement.\nMR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. -- Ms. Grunder.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCES T. GRUNDER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. GRUNDER: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nTurner's unitary deferential standard of review\nbalances inmates' rights with the exceptionally dangerous\nand difficult job of running a prison. The Turner\nstandard applies here because the need for prison\ndeference doesn't change with the nature of the right\nasserted.\nCalifornia is Ground Zero for raced-based prison\nand street gangs. The Aryan Brotherhood, the Black\nGuerilla Family, the Mexican Mafia, and the Nuestra\nFamilia --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any evidence in the\nrecord that the initial placing of two inmates in the same\ncell has ever had -- has ever produced a racial incident?\nMS. GRUNDER: In the reception center, Your\nHonor?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Pardon me?\nMS. GRUNDER: In the reception centers?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMS. GRUNDER: No, because the -- the inmates are\nnot interracially housed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You've never tried it.\nMS. GRUNDER: There's nothing in the record,\nYour Honor. The policy has been in effect for a\nconsiderable length of time, and -- and during that time,\nthey have not interracially housed inmates in the same\ncell. I think it's important to remember here that the\npolicy only applies in the reception center areas and in\nthe cells.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it applies in the\nreception center area for someone who has been transferred\nas well as the -- an initial incarceration.\nMS. GRUNDER: It's a very shortened period for a\ntransferee. It's only 14 days under the California\nregulations, and it only applies if they are put in a\ncell. If there is someone who is eligible to be housed in\na dormitory, that is, somebody who has been convicted of a\nless violent offense or they have more information about,\nthen the dormitories are fully integrated, as well as\nevery other aspect of the reception center.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- I'm sorry. Even in the\ncase of -- of housing in cells, what's the justification\nfor it? The argument is -- excuse me -- on the initial\nintake, we don't know enough about them. Well, on -- on\nthe transfer, you've had plenty of time to know about\nthem. Why is it justifiable even for 14 days on -- on the\ntransfer?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I don't understand\ntoo. That -- that's really what most troubles me about\nthis case. Why -- why do you do this to the transferees\nat all?\nMS. GRUNDER: There's a -- there's a couple of\nreasons, Your Honors. First of all, as much as you may\nknow about the transferring individual, you may not know\nthe information about their prospective cellmate at the\ntransfer institution because they may be somebody who's a\nnewly received cellmate, somebody who is going through a\nreception center process themselves.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, unless you house them\nwith the cellmate, what are you going to learn from\nsegregating them for 14 days?\nMS. GRUNDER: What happens when they arrive at\nthe receiving institution is there needs to be time for a\nrecord review. The records do not arrive at the exact\nsame time as the inmates. And so they convene a\nclassification committee and at which point they review\nthe records.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if we have a choice\nbetween segregating by race and speeding up the delivery\nof records, isn't it constitutionally preferable to get\nthe records delivered on time?\nMS. GRUNDER: The records need to stay with the\ninmate at the old prison until the inmate leaves on the\nbus for the new prison because --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why? Don't you have xeroxes?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. GRUNDER: Well, in the case of California,\nthere's over 165,000 inmates. In Mr. Johnson's case, his\nrecords probably are many, many banker's boxes full of\nrecords. So that's the type of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: When -- when -- there's a\ntransferee from prison A to prison B and he goes to the\nreception center. Does that transferee get housed with\nother transferees or is he also housed, from time to time\nor often, with new entrants into the system?\nMS. GRUNDER: He may be housed with new entrants\ninto the system and that -- that's the reason --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so as to one-half of the\npeople in that -- in that instance, you don't know what\nthe other inmate's record is.\nMS. GRUNDER: That's correct, Your Honor. And I\nwould like to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You could house transferees\nonly with other transferees, I assume.\nMS. GRUNDER: That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that -- is that too hard to\nfigure out?\nMS. GRUNDER: That's possible, Your Honor. That\ncurrently is not the practice, but that is possible.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Ms. Grunder, is this policy a\n-- an unwritten policy of California?\nMS. GRUNDER: It is -- yes, it is a practice. I\nwouldn't characterize it a policy. It's a practice.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: An admitted practice but not\nwritten.\nMS. GRUNDER: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And is -- does any other\nState have such a policy, written or otherwise?\nMS. GRUNDER: Yes, they do, Your Honor, and I\nwould like to address that. The two largest States of\ninmate population, California and Texas, together comprise\nabout 300,000 inmates, which is about 20 percent of the\ntotal inmate prison population in the United States,\nincluding the Bureau of Prisons. Those two States have a\nsimilar policy.\nIn addition, Oklahoma --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What is Texas' policy? Is\nthat in writing?\nMS. GRUNDER: Yes, I believe it is, Your Honor.\nWhen Texas was subjected to the integration decree, the\none area of the prison that was not part of the decree\nthat they did not require them to integrate was the area\nthat is the equivalent of our reception center. There --\nthere in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is in the briefs? I don't\nremember it from the briefs. Did -- did you discuss this\nin --\nMS. GRUNDER: Yes, Your Honor, it is in the\nbriefs. It's -- it has to do with the Trulson study, and\nthe Trulson study indicated that the intake diagnostic\ncenters of Texas were not required to be integrated.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. If we -- if we\nexclude Texas and California, on your recording, we've\nstill got 80 percent of the -- the prison population in\nthe United States, and apparently neither the Federal\nprisons nor any State does -- apart from Texas, has this\npolicy. Why -- I mean, how do you account for the fact\nthat there doesn't seem to be any evidence that -- that\nthey are having explosive incidents involving new members\nbased upon racial animosity?\nMS. GRUNDER: Your Honor, actually there's\nanother State, Oklahoma, which has a very similar policy\nthat says that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. We've still got 47\nStates left.\nHow -- how do you explain the fact that -- and\n-- and some of them don't have your racial problems.\nThere's no question about it. I come from one that does\nnot. But some do. And -- and how do you explain the fact\nthat there is no sort of confirmatory record of what\nhappens when you don't follow your policy?\nMS. GRUNDER: Well, I think the answer is that\nthey don't have the same problems that California has.\nCalifornia has the most prison gangs, the -- they are\nrace-based. It's an extraordinarily difficult situation.\nAnd even the Bureau of Prisons takes race into account\nwhen it balances its prisons and that's in the United\nStates' brief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I go back to Texas?\nBecause one of the pieces of information that was featured\nby the other side was this study in Texas that showed a\ndecline in interracial violence when there was an increase\nin racial integration. So that empirical study showed\njust the opposite, that when you integrate, you get less\nviolence than when you separate.\nMS. GRUNDER: Yes, Your Honor. The Trulson\nstudy, however, only looked at inmates after they had left\nthe reception center, only looked at inmates in -- in the\nintegrated settings of the prison, equivalent to the areas\nthat California integrates. So we don't dispute that once\nyou have enough individualized information about an\ninmate, then you can house them according to an\nindividualized information.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On the individualized, there\nwas something that I didn't grasp. You say we don't know\nanything about these people, so we have to have that 60-\nday period to find out about them. The presentence report\nwe're told accompanies the conviction, the prisoner's\nconviction. So the presentence report will have a fair\namount of information about the offender, will it not?\nMS. GRUNDER: It would have a fair amount of\ninformation. However, in California, the presentence\nreport does not always accompany the inmate and frequently\ndoes not. It follows some period of time later from the\ncounty.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But again, that's the kind of\nadministrative problem that would seem easily fixable. I\nthought the -- the rule or the regulation was that the\npresentence report is supposed to accompany the\nconviction.\nMS. GRUNDER: But the fact of the matter is,\nYour Honor, the counties aren't preparing the presentences\n-- presentence reports in a timely fashion, and -- and\nthey're not sending them --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, maybe something should\nbe done about that.\nMS. GRUNDER: Yes, with the counties, perhaps.\nBut another issue with the presentence report is\nit doesn't deal with in-prison behavior, and that's what\nthe prison officials need a -- need time to take a look\nat, is how the inmate is going to react once they get in\nthe prison environment, which is a wholly different\nenvironment than a jail environment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask what's probably a\nstupid question? We're concerned, I suppose, about say, a\nblack prisoner who's just coming into prison for the first\ntime and you hope he won't join one of the black gangs.\nSo wouldn't the safest thing to do for the first 20 days\nis to put him with a cellmate who's not black?\nMS. GRUNDER: No, Your Honor, because in prison\nthe animosity between the gangs is purely race-based, and\nthat inmate may be subjected --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Between the gangs. But I'm\nassuming a new prisoner who you have no information about.\nDo you presume he's a member of a gang or presume he's\nsomebody who may not be a member of a gang?\nMS. GRUNDER: There's not a presumption that the\nperson is a member of the gang. But there is a\npresumption --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, if he's not a member of\nthe gang, isn't the danger that he'll become affiliated\nwith the gang increased by insisting on putting him with\nthe same race as -- as he is?\nMS. GRUNDER: That may be, but there is also a\ndanger that if he is housed interracially and subjected to\ngang pressures on the yard, that he will then be in a\nsituation to go back to his cell, when the door is closed\nand the lights are out, and commit violent acts upon his\ncellmate at -- because of pressures that he's receiving\nfrom members of his own race.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, you -- you have\nnever -- no evidence that that's ever happened because\nyou've never tried it.\nMS. GRUNDER: In the reception centers, no. The\n-- it has been a policy of not cross-racially housing the\ninmates in the cells only. That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you said a second ago\nthat there's a significant difference between the\nconditions in the jails and the conditions in -- in the\nprisons. Is that significant difference the -- the\norganization of -- of racially based gangs in the prisons\nas distinct from the jails?\nMS. GRUNDER: Yes, I think that's true. And\nthere's also a difference I think in the attitude of -- of\nthe inmates when they're in -- in a state of flux in a\njail as opposed to when they arrive to serve their many\nyears-long sentence, in the case of Mr. Johnson, 37 years\nto life. And then I think the reality sets in and -- and\nthings do change. Prison is very different.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Apart from the gang situation,\nis there reason to think that their minds change in the\nsense of inclining them to interracial violence simply\nbecause they say, gee, I'm in for a long time?\nMS. GRUNDER: Yes, I -- I believe it is.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And do we have any evidence to\nthat effect?\nMS. GRUNDER: Well, the reality in prison is\nthat people are pressured to join gangs and to -- you\neither hang with your own or you don't and --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that -- I mean, that goes\nback to the gang membership situation. It seems to me\nthat's your strongest argument.\nMS. GRUNDER: Yes, it's true. But even for\nmembers -- people who are not actually members of the gang\nare subjected to the gang pressures. For instance, if --\nif there was going to be a fight, a planned fight, that\nwas going to break out on a yard, members of a prison gang\nwould tell members of -- of their same race that once the\nfight breaks out, you better be with us because if you're\nnot, we'll deal with you later. And that's even for\npeople who aren't gang members. So the racial pressures\nin prison are very, very severe. Something --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it still seems to me that\na new inmate is more likely to be subjected to that\npressure with the -- his cellmates than with somebody out\nin the yard.\nMS. GRUNDER: And he may well be, Your Honor,\nbut what --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And it seems to me insurance\nagainst him joining a racial gang is cell -- cell him with\nsomebody who's not of the same race.\nMS. GRUNDER: But you -- but to do that would be\nto invite danger to the -- to the other inmate. The --\nthe level of interracial violence in prison is high, and\nthat can't be disregarded. And if we weren't here\ntoday --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does it compare to\nintraracial violence?\nMS. GRUNDER: There hasn't, as -- as we've\ntalked about, been a problem with interracial violence in\nthe cells because they're not housed that way. There are\nproblems with --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean --\nMS. GRUNDER: In general.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- overall.\nMS. GRUNDER: There are some problems with\nintraracial violence, but they're generally more founded\nin personal relations as opposed to a race-based -- you\nknow, some other sort of animosity. The same sort of\nreasons that people have fights on the outside --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there -- is there any\nfigures on the prison population as a whole, the incidents\nof interracial violence as opposed to intraracial\nviolence?\nMS. GRUNDER: No, Your Honor. In this case\nthere's -- it's not in the record.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And do we know -- does this\nrecord tell us what happens after the 60 days? To what\nextent where there are double cells, does the same race\npolicy, although not formally adopted, continue? After\nthe 60 days, what is the incidence of different race\ndouble-celling and same race double-celling?\nMS. GRUNDER: What we do have in the record,\nYour Honor, is that the policy and the practice does not\napply after the 60 days. Inmates are allowed to request a\ncell together and can choose their own cellmates so long\nas the other cellmate agrees.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So we just don't have any\ninformation whether this line between the 60 days is\nimaginary.\nMS. GRUNDER: We do, Your Honor. The -- it is\nnot -- it does not happen outside of the reception center\ncell practice. Once they get to their permanent housing\nassignment, they may choose their own cellmates.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: When -- when they do choose\nthat, do you respect a choice to cell with -- with another\nmember of -- of the -- of -- do you respect the choice\nwhen two members of a gang want to cell together?\nMS. GRUNDER: Two members of the same gang?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Same gang.\nMS. GRUNDER: It -- it would depend on if they\nare -- what level of gang membership they are. California\nhas a very complex system for what -- doing what they call\nvalidating gang membership. If they are a validated gang\nmember, generally they are sent to a special prison, and\nyes, they are housed with members of their own gangs in a\nvery high security setting.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you -- do you have a -- do\nyou have any record of -- of requests by different --\nmembers of different gangs to cell together?\nMS. GRUNDER: We don't have any record of that,\nbut I -- I can tell you that if members of opposing gangs\nwere to request a cell together, first of all, they would\nboth have to agree, which would be highly unlikely, and\nthere -- it would probably be viewed with a bit of\nsuspicion as to what was going on. But maybe if -- if\nthey had disavowed their gang membership and -- and these\nparticular people could get along, it would certainly be\nconsidered. The -- the object, once they get to the\npermanent housing, is cellmate compatibility. So there\nare a lot of things that are looked at.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Ms. Grunder, do you agree\nwith opposing counsel that even if evaluated under the\nTurner rule, properly applied, that California's policy\nwould not survive?\nMS. GRUNDER: I do not agree with counsel. I\nbelieve that the Ninth Circuit did properly apply the\nTurner standard in this case and that California would\npass and does pass the Turner test in this case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It wouldn't -- it wouldn't pass\nif -- would it, if we do not accept your argument that\nCalifornia cannot efficiently get records sent along with\ninmates so that, at the time at least of transfers, the\nprisons are in a position to know what they're getting?\nIf we -- if we say, look, we're not going to accept the\nargument from administrative efficiency, then you can't\nsurvive Turner, can you?\nMS. GRUNDER: Well, it may be more than just\nadministrative efficiency because every prison is\ndifferent and there are different gang pressures at each\nprison. And I think it's important for the prison to be\nallowed an opportunity to bring that transferred inmate in\nand look at them and how they're going to fit into that\nprison and have a chance to evaluate their records. It's\ntrue that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's --\nMS. GRUNDER: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. I don't want to cut your\nargument short, but here's what's bothering me. I -- I\ncan see there's a possible plausibility in what you're\nsaying, but in fact is that the reason? Is there any\nevidence in the record to the effect that that is\nnecessary in transfer situations?\nMS. GRUNDER: The officials have deemed that\nthat is an appropriate policy. I think the record is a\nbit scant in this case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Look, if -- if we accept\nthat officials have deemed it, we will not have many\narguments in -- in this Court. I mean, they will be over\nbefore they start. I -- I mean, we've got to have\nsomething more than simply the decision under attack. Is\nthere anything more in this case in -- with respect to the\ntransferee situation?\nMS. GRUNDER: Not with respect to the\ntransferees, Your Honor, and it's true that the transfer\npolicy certainly is more in jeopardy under the Turner\nstandard. But the -- the overall policy of considering\nrace when there is a -- a lack of information certainly\nwould pass the Turner standard and should pass the Turner\nstandard as it was properly applied by the Ninth Circuit.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask just one other\nquestion about the -- the purpose you're trying to\nachieve? Is it to protect the two inmates who are first\ncelled together from fighting with one another, or is it\nto avoid the danger that one of them will somehow start a\nriot later on in -- in the general prison population?\nMS. GRUNDER: It's multi-fold, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's what?\nMS. GRUNDER: It's multi-fold. The purpose is\nmulti-fold. First, yes, it is to protect the inmate from\n-- from having harm done to him in the cell, which is a\nvery difficult area to protect. It's a small area and not\neasily visible into the -- into the cell directly. Also,\nthat's where they sleep, so at some point the lights will\nbe out. So it's a very difficult situation.\nAlso, they're afraid -- and this is in the\nrecord from the testimony of the officials -- that there\nwill be a ripple effect and that the interracial violence,\nif they were to cell them together, would spill out onto\nthe yards and create the exact ripple effect that Turner\n-- is one of the considerations in the Turner test.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was something --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- excuse me. Go\nahead.\nI want to ask one other question. You -- you\nmentioned the Texas system and you discussed it in your\nbrief. Is that correct? I didn't find it in your\ndiscussion as to the Texas case.\nMS. GRUNDER: Yes, Your Honors, at page 41 of\nthe brief. It would be the -- the second paragraph where\nthey examine double-celling only after initial screening.\nAnd also note 13 of the Trulson study indicates that it\ndid not apply in Texas' equivalent of California's\nreception centers.\nThe Turner standard is the appropriate standard\nhere because it does give the prison officials --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let -- let me ask --\nMS. GRUNDER: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- about that standard at\nleast as the Ninth Circuit applied it. They said that you\npresume the practice constitutional and the challenger has\nthe burden to show that if there were no segregation by\nrace, that violence would not increase. Now, how does\nsomeone go about proving that negative?\nMS. GRUNDER: Well, in this case the inmate put\nforth no experts of any kind. There was an opportunity\nfor the inmate to rebut the evidence put forth by the\nprison officials, and -- and there was no evidence\nsubmitted. So in this case he didn't --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But how would an inmate who\nwas objecting to this racial segregation go about proving\nsuch a case? You said one would have to rely on experts.\nMS. GRUNDER: That would be one way, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And so one could put in that\nTexas study, but you said that wouldn't be good enough.\nMS. GRUNDER: Well, the Texas study doesn't --\ndoesn't apply to the initial intake process.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you -- you -- supposing an\ninmate who would have to call a bevy of experts that he\nhas no wherewithal to -- to pay for -- I mean, you are\nessentially saying an inmate cannot challenge this policy.\nMS. GRUNDER: No, Your Honor. Actually this\npolicy was applied in a California case after the Johnson\ncase was decided in California to strike down a race-\nbased prison policy. So there -- there certainly are\ninstances when the inmate could --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I asked how would an\ninmate prove this, and you said you would need experts.\nSo for experts, you need money to pay experts. How does\nan inmate do that?\nMS. GRUNDER: Well, the same way the inmate\nwould do it in any other litigation that is brought by an\ninmate. The burden is on a litigant to prove their case,\nand it doesn't change because that litigant is in prison.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, why -- why should you use\nthe Turner standard? The Turner standard says to the\nprison, you can do this as long as you have a modestly\ngood reason. Strict scrutiny says you have to have a very\ngood reason. With free speech, of course, people\nunderstand prisons are different. Of course, people's\nspeech rights will be controlled and it won't hurt the\nrest of society. With racial discrimination, as you heard\nyour opponents argue, it's a terrible symbol, a symbol\nthat we would tolerate without the best of reasons\ndiscrimination, invidious discrimination, based on race,\nwhich is divisive to the whole society. Now, that they\nsay is a very good reason for not applying the Turner\nstandard but, rather, applying strict scrutiny, which\ngives you freedom to discriminate on this basis if you can\nprove you really have to.\nMS. GRUNDER: Unlike in a non-prison setting,\nthere aren't other rights to be balanced. In the prison\nsetting, not only are you balancing the inmate's right to\nbe free from discrimination, but you're balancing the --\nthe rights of all inmates to be free from harm, and as\nwell as the prison officials' duty to protect them from\nharm. And that is what --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that same argument\ncould have made in -- in arguing about racial segregation\nin the schools and -- and in the military and everything\nelse. That's -- that's not an acceptable answer.\nMS. GRUNDER: Well, there's -- there's no -- the\nprison officials here have an affirmative duty to protect\nthe other inmates under the Eighth Amendment, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you accept that this is\ninvidious discrimination on the basis of race? What --\nwhat -- why -- why do you think it's invidious?\nMS. GRUNDER: We don't think it's invidious,\nYour Honor. As a matter of fact --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not affirmative action.\nMS. GRUNDER: This is not affirmative action,\nno.\nIt is not invidious, Justice Scalia. It is\nsimply one consideration of race to control violence in\nprison, and as the Bureau of Prisons uses in -- in its\nprisons, they in the United States' brief say that they\nconsider race to maintain racial balance in their prisons\nfor the purpose of diversity. California also considers\nrace in maintaining racial balance in its prisons, not\nprimarily for the purpose of diversity, but for prison\nsafety to make sure that no one group takes over a prison,\nthus putting members of another group in a vulnerable\nsituation.\nThere are many circumstances when -- when race\nshould be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that -- is that invidious?\nMS. GRUNDER: No, it is not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it affirmative action?\nMS. GRUNDER: No.\nThere are many instances in which race needs to\nbe considered on a day-to-day basis in prison. For\ninstance, when the prisoners line up to go to the exercise\nyard, if 10 white prisoners line up first and the 11th\nprisoner in line is an African American, it would be\nextraordinarily ill-advised to release those prisoners in\nthe manner in which they have lined up to go to yard. It\nwould require some reshuffling and maybe even some\nshifting of prisoners from yard to yard based on their\nrace because to do that would put the minority member at\nextreme risk.\nTurner is the appropriate test here because\ncourts --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I -- this may -- may be\nimportant to me for understanding your argument. I -- I\ndidn't quite understand the hypothetical. You -- you want\nhim to keep the place in line or it's dangerous for him to\nkeep the place in line?\nMS. GRUNDER: It would be dangerous for the\nofficer to release the inmates onto the yard in the manner\nthat they had self-arrayed because then you would put 10\nmembers or more of one group on the yard and then\nintroduce another member to the yard who was not a member\nof that group, and that would be very dangerous for the --\nthe sole person on the yard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And do -- do other prison\nsystems adopt similar policies to try to keep the races\nmixed generally in --\nMS. GRUNDER: Yes, they do, Your Honor. As I\npointed out, Bureau of Prisons being one. As a matter of\nfact, the U.S. Department of Justice's National\nCorrections Institute statistics -- and this is not a part\nof the record -- indicate that 96 percent of all States\nseparate prisoners based on disruptive group or gang\norientation. So California is not alone in that. It's a\n-- it's done to prevent violence to other prisoners.\nIn sum, Turner is the only test that provides\nthe flexibility that prison officials need to safely\nmanage their prisons and protect inmates from harm. The\nCourt should apply it here and affirm the lower court.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Grunder.\nMr. Deixler, you have about three and a half\nminutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BERT H. DEIXLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DEIXLER: The -- the hypotheticals presented\nby the State of California, when applied in the context of\nthis case, demonstrate the danger of this position of\nsegregation. The petitioner in this case is not a gang\nmember. He's been in the California prison system since\n1987 and before. When he reported to the inmate reception\ncenter at Chino in 1987, he had already three presentence\nreports which are reflected in -- in the record of this --\nof this case at the joint exhibit 259. He's been\ntransferred five times since then -- since then. There's\nno record of his having had interracial violence ever\nduring the time that he was in prison.\nAnd it is his view, as articulated in his\ndeposition at page 109 of the joint appendix, that he is\nput into peril because he is an African American who is\nunable to cross race lines and unable to reach out for\nsupport in a heavily racialized setting for other persons\nwho are not African Americans and who are not gang\nmembers. So he's been marginalized and treated, based\nupon his race, in a de jure way when he's transferred for\nthe 60-day period.\nAnd incidentally, the reference to a 14-day\nperiod is not borne out by the record. The regulation in\nthe State of California specifically provides that this\norganization or evaluation group has to convene within 14\ndays, but not have to reach a decision with regard to\ntransfer characterization and classification in 14 days.\nBut -- but the petitioner in this case, because\nhe's black and has no opportunity to cell initially with a\nwhite person or a Hispanic person, is then confined to\nbeing in this small group of African Americans who are not\ngang members and who are unable to have an affinity group\nin which they will feel safe within the California prison\nsystem.\nThe California --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The same thing would happen to\na white. It's not because he's black. I mean, this --\nright? The same thing would happen to a white.\nMR. DEIXLER: Yes. A white --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He'd be able to make the same\nargument.\nMR. DEIXLER: A white who, for reasons of\nsafety, wished to house with an African American, would be\ndenied that opportunity under California's policy, and the\nsame with an Hispanic who felt it safer for him to house\nwith a black. He could not cross racial lines based upon\nthe evidence in this case, Justice Scalia. That's\ncorrect.\nAnd the danger which is created in my judgment\nby a reliance upon a Turner standard in this circumstance\nis that all that needs to be done is a little bit more of\ntinkering with the idea of the equivalence between race\nand gang which cannot exist in this record. And were that\nto happen, we will create a circumstance where the very\narguments rejected in Lee, indeed the very argument\nadvanced by the State of California in this case, will\nonce again be raised time and again, and we will be faced\nwith a circumstance not too far down the slippery slope\nwhere, for convenience or for other reasons or for purely\ninvidious reasons, States will be able to return to an era\nof segregation. This Court's history has demonstrated a\ncommitment to march the country away from the road of\nsegregation, and there should be no turning back.\nThis is a case in which the Ninth Circuit has\nerred. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit should be\nreversed. The Court should determine that strict scrutiny\nshould apply, and it should determine that Petitioner\nJohnson's equal protection rights were violated.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Deixler.\n"
