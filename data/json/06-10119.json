        "content": "(11:12 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in case 06-10119, Synder v. Louisiana.\nMr. Bright.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BRIGHT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BRIGHT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe decision here of the majority of the\nLouisiana Supreme Court on remand from this Court is an\nextraordinary departure from the lessons that this Court\ntaught in its Miller-El decisions. And I point out sort\nof three overarching errors in that regard.\nFirst, the majority looked at each of the\nMiller-El factors or some of them, and largely\ndiscounted them. That there were five African-Americans\nstruck, they whittled that down to two. That there was\ndisparate questioning, they identified that of the white\njurors and Jeffrey Brooks, but they said that counted\nfor the State. And Miller-El clearly teaches that it\ndidn't.\nThey found there was no racial implication\nin the mention of O.J. Simpson case from the start of\nthe case all the way through, because neither O.J.\nSimpson's race nor Mr. Snyder's race was mentioned.\nSecondly, there were some Miller-El factors\nthat were not considered at all, not even acknowledged.\nFor example, one of the most powerful ones, the failure\nto ask any questions of Jeffrey Brooks or Elaine Scott.\nThere are very ambiguous general reasons for striking\nthem. They asked no questions. In this case, you could\nask anybody any questions you wanted as a lawyer.\nAnd then thirdly, when they got to the point\nof considering them cumulatively, they had now whittled\nthem down to where there was very little to consider.\nAnd our position is that what Justice\nKimball did, the author of the original decision, who\nwrote the dissenting opinion, one of the two dissents\nhere, actually did what this Court remanded this case to\ndo, which was reconsideration in light of Miller-El,\nbecause when you consider all those factors together,\nnothing answers the question of or explains them as well\nas race.\nYou can pick each piece out, each leaf out\nand you can try to find an innocent explanation for it.\nBut when you stand back and look at it all together --\nand that's why the court missed the fact that the back\nstrike was racially motivated in this case.\nIt just simply didn't look at these things\nin the context --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you about one of\nthe factors?\nMR. BRIGHT: Sure.\nJUSTICE ALITO: It's hard to discuss them\nall at the same time. What is the relevance of strikes\nof black lawyers that you don't argue were based on\nrace? It's hard for me to understand why that's\nrelevant in this calculation.\nSuppose there's a case where it's perfectly\nclear that certain strikes were not racially motivated.\nLet's say the prosecution has the strategy of striking\nevery lawyer who's on the panel. It strikes every white\nlawyer and it strikes every black lawyer. Then what is\nthe relevance of the fact that the black lawyers were\nperemptorily challenged?\nMR. BRIGHT: Well, I see. You mean the\njurors happen to be lawyers and they are struck?\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's right.\nMR. BRIGHT: There's a common reason. Well,\nif that's the case and you have considered that in\nMiller-El, that's a factor for race neutrality. The\ndifference here is the reason given for striking Brooks,\nfor example, is he might have a reason to go home --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You are making the argument\nthere were five African-American jurors who were the\nsubject of prosecutorial peremptory challenges.\nMR. BRIGHT: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And -- but you don't claim\nthat three of those strikes were based on race? Do you?\nMR. BRIGHT: Well, no different than\nMiller-El. The Court in Miller-El says you look at the\nprima facie case because it is unlikely to happen by\nchance.\nJUSTICE ALITO: There were a large number of\nstrikes in Miller-El. This is a much smaller number.\nCould you just explain, if you can, what is the\nrelevance of strikes that you do not even claim were\nracially motivated?\nMR. BRIGHT: Well, the difference is that as\nin Miller-El it is unlikely to happen by happenstance.\nThey struck all the blacks they could in this case.\nThere were only five. They struck every one of them.\nAnd the way they went about striking them -- and the\ncontext of all this -- it doesn't say that all five of\nthose, that's -- Justice Alito, but that's the classic\nBatson case where the prima facie case is strong, given\nthe number of people struck, but you zero in on the\nparticular jurors where doing the side by side\ncomparison, the failure to ask any questions, the other\nfactors that were identified --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think that's right\nthat you zero in on the ones as to which you objected.\nBut you also want to rely on the fact that these other\njurors were excluded, and no objection was made to their\nexclusion. If an objection had been made, the State, of\ncourse, would have -- could have explained if they had a\nreason, a non-racial one, why they were struck. But you\ndidn't object.\nAnd yet you want them to be considered as\nconvincing racial bias.\nMR. BRIGHT: Well, part of the reason they\nweren't struck, Mr. Chief Justice, was one of the\nelements of race here. The prosecution accepted the\nfirst black juror. So when the second one, Gregory\nScott is struck, there's only one out of two. There's\nno the pattern. Then Mr. Hawkins is struck. Now it's\ntwo out of three. It is when Miss Elaine Scott was\nstruck. And now it's three out of four. There's still\none African-American.\nAt that point defense counsel said there's a\npattern, and I strike based on the pattern of striking\nAfrican-Americans.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Couldn't counsel at that\npoint have gone back and said, ah, now I see what's\ngoing on, so I'm going to challenge -- I'm going to\ninterpose a Batson challenge with respect to the second\nand third African-American?\nMR. BRIGHT: Or actually the first and\nsecond. You're right. The second and third. There was\n-- that certainly could have been done. I think\nbasically the defense was snookered here.\nBut also, there was nothing to prevent the\nprosecution from giving reasons. In fact, Mr. Oland,\nthe junior prosecutor here, he starts to say, I struck\nMr. Hawkins, and at that point Williams, the senior\nprosecutor, said, don't say anything. Stop --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Presumably because\nno objection was raised as to Mr. Hawkins. I mean, it\nis -- the burden is on you to object if you think jurors\nare being excluded on a racial basis.\nMR. BRIGHT: Well, but the only thing we're\nputting the pattern forward for is step three of Batson,\nwhere both Miller-El decisions make it quite clear that\nif the numbers are such that it is unlikely to happen by\nhappenstance, that's one element. It is not that all\nfive necessarily were struck on the basis of race. But\nit is the fact that that unlikely event, that five out\nof five were struck, informs that decision in Batson\nsaying looking at all relevant facts, it doesn't\nexclude -- I've seen Batson challenges where a lawyer\nwill say, well, with regards to five and six, then we\nthink those are particularly strong, not with regards to\nothers -- Miller-El did that.\nThey only challenged seven on direct appeal,\nonly challenged six on the habeas corpus case that\nultimately made its way to this Court, and this Court\nonly found with regard to two.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Out of -- out of how\nmany who were struck.\nMR. BRIGHT: Ten. So they only challenged\nseven of those on -- on direct appeal, six on habeas\ncorpus, and this Court only found Jurors Fields and\nJuror Ward. That's basically -- we're here saying, you\nstruck five out of five, all that he possibly could\nhave, and Juror Brooks -- if you look at all the\nMiller-El factors with regard to Jeffrey Brooks, just\ntwo general reasons that probably applied to everybody\nthere. He was nervous; I expect every citizen called\nout of their home or out of their work --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The district judge is in a\nmuch better position to decide those matters, such as\nyou know, he -- his -- his response was -- was slow on\n-- one the question of, you know, whether he could\nconsider the death penalty. I can't tell that from a\ncold record, and that's why we -- rely upon the trial\njudge.\nMR. BRIGHT: Well, that was with regard to\nMs. Scott.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. BRIGHT: Justice Scalia, there -- only\none juror here was ambivalent about the death penalty,\nsaid she wasn't sure. She's cross-examined for four or\nfive pages of transcript. 23 -- 21, I'm sorry -- jurors\nare asked if they are opposed to the death penalty and\nanswer the question yes. 21. Every single one is asked\nat least two and some were asked more questions. The\nonly person not asked any questions was Elaine Scott.\nShe first says, could you impose the death penalty? \"I\nthink I could.\" Then she says later, \"I could.\" If you\nlook at the three jurors right before her, Mr. Boyd, \"I\ncould consider it,\" Ms. Sara Coney, \"I could consider\nit,\" Mr. Salita, \"I could consider it,\" Miss Scott, \"I\ncould.\"\nThey all give the same answer. Two of those\npeople, Justice Scalia, end up on the jury in this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm looking at\n-- at the joint appendix on page 360. As I read it,\nMiss Scott gives an answer that can't be heard, right?\nMR. BRIGHT: Right. The first time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Dupont says,\n\"I'm sorry, I can't hear you.\" I mean, we don't know;\nsince we weren't there if it was kind of, you know, \"I\nthink I could\" and then \"I think\" -- I mean, you know,\nit's an atmospheric determination by the -- the district\ncourt judge; and as -- as has been pointed out here, all\nwe have is the cold transcript.\nMR. BRIGHT: Well, then, just a couple of\npages later, Mr. Chief Justice, she says I could. She\ngives the same answer that the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's on joint\nappendix 401?\nMR. BRIGHT: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and the\nproblem with that, of course, is it's --\nMR. BRIGHT: I'm sorry. 367.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 367.\nMR. BRIGHT: She says \"I think I could\" at\n361. And then just a few pages later they go each\njuror, and she says \"I could.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but -- the\nquestion is not could you consider the death penalty.\nIt says could you consider both, when they're going\nthrough several of the juries. Jurors.\nMR. BRIGHT: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I thought that\nwas -- the point was made by your friend on the other\nside, was that it was ambiguous as to what option she\nwas saying she could consider.\nMR. BRIGHT: Well, I'd invite the Court to\nlook at that. Because what that starts out with is a\nquestion about life. Could you consider life\nimprisonment. And then when Ms. Goff is answered, she\nsays the death penalty, could I consider it? Yes, I\ncould consider it. And then everybody says they could\nconsider it.\nNow, the Louisiana Supreme Court treated\nthis as her saying I could consider the death penalty.\nThat's what they said. But here's the other point with\nMiss Scott. It only took one question: Ms. Scott, what\ndid you mean when you said I think you could?\nI mean that was in Miller-El -- in the\nopinion in Miller-El II, the fact that Fields wasn't\nasked any questions about the position on the death\npenalty. He had expressed some; but if the\nprosecutor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, these are peremptory\nchallenges. It seems to me if you have one -- one juror\nwho says I think I could and another one who said I\ncould, I'm going to strike the one who said I think I\ncould.\nMR. BRIGHT: But Justice Scalia, there's no\nreason you wouldn't ask them what they meant. And\nthat's what the prosecutors did with all the white\njurors here -- every single one. It's only Ms. Scott,\nElaine Scott that there's no questions asked about the\nreasons they gave for striking her. So they had the\nopportunity to ask her what she meant and they asked all\n21 of the white jurors. They asked the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did all 21 say I think I\ncould?\nMR. BRIGHT: No. All 21 said no. And then\nthe prosecution asked them follow-up questions about\nwhat their beliefs were. So in those situations, the\nprosecutor is asking questions to be sure to clarify\ntheir position on the death penalty. Miss Calligan is\nthe only one who says well, I'm not sure. So they asked\nMs. Calligan a number of questions. How long have you\nthought about it? What do you think? All those sorts\nof things. Ultimately it is pretty clear Ms. Calligan\nis opposed to the death penalty.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Bright, you make good\narguments about comparisons between white jurors and\nblack jurors.\nMR. BRIGHT: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What do we do with the\ncomparisons that you are making now to white jurors who\nwere never brought to the attention of the Louisiana\nSupreme Court?\nMR. BRIGHT: Well, I think Miller-El, again,\nanswers that, because the entire voir dire was before\nthe Louisiana Supreme Court. On remand from this Court\narguments were made about the -- the disparate\nquestioning of jurors; and also with Jeffrey Brooks,\nwhere that's also very clear because the reason given\nfor striking Jeffrey Brooks is that he would have a\nreason to want to go home early.\nMy experience is most jurors taken out of\ntheir homes and out of their work, would like to finish\ntheir job and go home early.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I think you have a good\nargument in comparing him to some of the white jurors,\nin particular Mr. Laws.\nMR. BRIGHT: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But my understanding is you\nnever relied on Mr. Laws before the Louisiana Supreme\nCourt. Is that correct?\nMR. BRIGHT: Not Mr. Laws specifically, but\nyou can look at the other people that are mentioned in\nJustice Kimball's dissent. Mr. Yeager had something\ncoming out on Sunday; he wanted to get home for that.\nBrandon Burns --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But the arguments as to each\nof them are different. The argument as to Mr. Yeager, I\nthink is much weaker. He had one event on a Sunday and\nhe was told you don't have to worry about that, this\ncase is going to be over by Sunday.\nMR. BRIGHT: Well --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So that's quite different\nfrom somebody -- it could be quite different from\nsomeone like Mr. Brooks or Mr. Laws. Isn't that?\nMR. BRIGHT: Actually the reason they say\nthey're concerned about Mr. Brooks is because he was\ntold, your dean says it won't be a problem. And he says\nokay. No further expression of worry by him.\nThere is, by the other jurors, that were\naccepted -- they all say on the record I need to get\nback to my job, to my family. Mr. Burns -- a single\nparent, teenagers, 89-year-old grandparents that he\nwants to get back to. All of those people accepted by\nthe State. And Justice Kimball deals with some of those\nin her dissenting opinions, and they're briefed up to\nthe Louisiana Supreme Court on remand from this case.\nBut I believe Miller-El III -- or II --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand how the\ndean could resolve his problem.\nMR. BRIGHT: Well, he's the dean.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The man's problem, what\nhe's worried about is that he has to put in a certain\nnumber of hours of teaching. And what was it? A couple\nof months before the end of the term? It was going to\nbe very --\nMR. BRIGHT: No, this was in August. This\nwas right before the Labor Day weekend in August. The\nterm went all the way to December, Justice Scalia. And\nhe, at this point -- Brooks -- was just observing\nsomeone else teach. I mean, he wasn't teaching himself.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whatever. He had to be\nthere to observe. He had to put in a certain number of\nhours. How could the dean say oh, don't worry, it's no\nproblem?\nMR. BRIGHT: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The hours requirement is a\nrequirement for the degree. I don't think deans have\nthe ability to -- to waive degree requirements.\nMR. BRIGHT: Well, with all due respect,\nYour Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe the dean was just\nsaying oh, he'll be able to do it, and --\nMR. BRIGHT: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that wouldn't inspire a\ngreat deal of confidence in me, even if I said okay.\nMR. BRIGHT: Well, again, it would have only\ntaken one question. One question -- Mr. Books, now that\nyou've heard that your dean said it won't be a problem,\ndo you have further concerns about wanting to get home\nquickly? Mr. Brooks --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: My reaction would be --\nwould depend on how he said okay. And if I were sitting\nthere as the trial judge, I -- I could discern whether\nokay meant well, you know, that's what he says but I'm\nstill going to have a hard time digging out those hours\nfor the remaining time that I have in the term. I don't\nknow how he said okay.\nMR. BRIGHT: If --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If --\nMR. BRIGHT: If I could answer that\nquestion, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIf you're the lawyer standing there beside\nhim and he says what you just said, then you ask him one\nquestion. But there's a professor, Sanders; he's not\nwatching class; he's teaching class at the start of a\nsemester at the University of New Orleans; and he\ndoesn't -- it is no speculation. With Brooks it's all\nspeculation. With Sanders --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With Brooks, what he\nsaid when he said I'm missing right now something that\nwill better me towards my teaching career, and they\nsay -- and the judge says, is there anybody who could\nspeak to it? And he says, I've already talked to the\ndean. And so based on the initial conversation with the\ndean he was still worried.\nMR. BRIGHT: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then the judge calls\nthe dean, and of course the dean's going to --\nMR. BRIGHT: No problem.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's what\nhe's going to say to the judge. When Brooks talked to\nhim, apparently there was a problem because his concern\nremained after having talked to the dean.\nMR. BRIGHT: Brooks doesn't say there's a\nproblem. He gives the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He says I'm missing\nright now --\nMR. BRIGHT: Something that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Something that could\nhelp me out towards my teaching career.\nMR. BRIGHT: Sure. Every -- the judge had\ngiven this hardship question; we're going to sequester\nthe jury, you're not going to be allowed to communicate\nwith anybody. You're going to have to stay out at the\nTravelodge while this case is going on. Of course, he\ndoesn't say at that point how long it's going to be.\nAnd 44 people come forward. But all -- with most of\nthose people, like with Brandon Burns, who has got to\nget back to his landscaping business, Mr. Laws who's has\nto get back two homes he's building; his wife is\nrecovering from surgery and taking his children to\nschool every day -- all those people are assured this\ncase is going to be over by Saturday; it's not going to\ngo very long. This argument that they were worried that\nthe jury might be out for a long time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand\nyour answer that Mr. Brooks did not say there was a\nproblem. He says, I've already missed half a day.\nThere's something I'm missing right now that will better\nme towards my teaching career. He says I've already\ntalked to the dean.\nHow can you say he isn't identifying a\nproblem?\nMR. BRIGHT: Well, he -- he's saying, again,\nnot knowing how long this is going to last, or what's\ngoing to be expected of him -- right now I'm missing\nsomething to help my education. Everybody is missing\nsomething that's going to help them in their job, with\ntheir families, or whatever.\nBut once the judge calls him back up to the\nbench and says, we've talked to the dean. He said it is\nnot going to be a problem for you to be here, most\nstudents I know -- and I know a lot of you have had\nexperience with students -- once they're assured by the\ndean that it's not going to be a problem, it's not going\nto be a problem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even if the assurance is\nonly secondhand, right?\nMR. BRIGHT: Well, I think when the judge --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When the dean says it's\nokay, that's all right.\nMR. BRIGHT: The judge of the court, the\npresiding judicial officer there, says we've talked to\nyour dean, and it's not going to be a problem for you to\nbe here this week. And everybody is told this week\nwe're going to try this case. This is a Labor Day\nweekend coming up. We know you will send the jury out\non Friday afternoon. You're not going to wait too long\nfor that verdict probably. And everybody is told --\nyou're going to be out of here by Saturday. Mr. Yeager,\nyou're going to be out of here by Sunday.\nSo we're talking really about Mr. Brooks\nmissing three more days. This is on Tuesday. This case\nis over on Friday.\nAnd everybody knew it was going to be over\non Friday, because they told jurors over and over and\nover again that it was going to be over by Friday, so --\nor Saturday at the latest.\nSo I -- I would say, again, no questions\nasked. The lawyers had an opportunity right there when\nthey told him the dean says it's not a problem. Then\nlater he's called in panel 1. You can ask -- you see\nthis voir dire. It is very interesting. It is very\nshort, but the lawyers could ask individual questions to\nany juror out there on the panel. Mr. Brooks,\ndo you have any concern that you won't be able to\nconcentrate because you need to get back to school?\nThey asked that question over and over, as\nwe pointed out in our brief, of white jurors. In fact,\nthe Louisiana Supreme Court, in what I think is one of\nits great legal errors --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose you are trying\nthis case. You are a defense attorney, and you ask a\njuror, a potential juror: Would you hold it against a\ndefendant who doesn't take the stand? And the initial\nanswer is: I have to think about that. I'm not quite\nsure.\nNow -- and then you go on, and you ask a lot\nof questions, and the juror comes around to saying: I\nunderstand that's a person's constitutional right. They\nget the -- advice from a lawyer. It doesn't necessarily\nmean the person has something to hide, et cetera, et\ncetera.\nDoes that additional questioning allay the\nconcern that you would have had at the beginning about\nthe fairness, the potential fairness, of the juror?\nMR. BRIGHT: Well, I think you have to look\nnot only at those answers but -- but what the court in\nMiller-El II said were the side-by-side comparisons.\nIf you're asking the white jurors follow-up\nquestions to determine that, then that, I think, cuts\nvery much against the prosecution and supports an\ninference of racial discrimination.\nIf you basically asked everybody about the\nsame thing, you can't draw that inference.\nBut the Louisiana Supreme Court said here\nthere was consistent questioning of the jurors about\nwhether whatever their other obligations were, it would\ninterfere with their ability to sit as jurors. There is\nconsistent questioning of everybody except Jeffrey\nBrooks. And that's the one African-American who the\ncourt -- who the prosecutors then say they're striking\nfor that reason.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bright, the Judge was\nquite passive, and was -- was the judge, in fact,\npresent throughout the entire voir dire?\nMR. BRIGHT: I -- I think the judge was\npresent, but he was quite passive. One of the more\nremarkable aspects of this jury selection is when he\ngrants a defense strike for cause, the prosecutor,\nMr. Williams, says -- are you crazy?\nAnd the judge says: No. And they go right\non to the next fact.\nYou know, I -- I practiced law for 30 years.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It sounds like the right\nanswer to me.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BRIGHT: It wasn't the right question.\nI've often wondered about that, but I've never\narticulated it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BRIGHT: And I think most lawyers\nwouldn't.\nThere's another point where Williams tells\nthe judge: Swear all these people to say they've got a\nvalid reason for leaving, and send them all out of here\n-- swearing people to say something that may be true or\nmay not be true.\nAnd the judge says: Well, do I do it\nindividually, or do I do it in a group?\nHe says: Do it in a group. Just have them\nall swear that they've got a legal reason, a hardship\nreason, to be excused.\nAnd the judge goes right along with it.\nI think what we see with the judge in every\nruling here is four or five words: I'm going to allow\nit. I'm going to allow it.\nThe judge is not engaged in questioning.\nUnlike Uttecht v. Brown that Justice Kennedy wrote about\nlast term where you have a judge involved and hearing\nthe lawyers and whatever, that's not present here.\nSo I think that when you look at that\nfactor, you don't have assurance that this judge was\ninvolved in a way to make sure that the credibility\ndeterminations which were being made -- and the other\npoint I would make is here he's ruling on the Batson\nstrikes as the jury is being selected. So he doesn't\nhave all of the information.\nNow, he does rule again on the motion for a\nnew trial. That's the only time that all of the\ninformation, all of the relevant information, is before\nthe judge. But, there again, all he says is I think the\nprosecutor's reasons were race-neutral.\nThere is no indication that he went beyond\nthat to consider what Batson said and what Miller-El\nsays we have to consider, which is all the relevant\nfactors.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Bright, may I ask, in\nyour judgment, was all the reference to O. J. Simpson\nrelevant at all to what is before us?\nMR. BRIGHT: I think it is, Justice Stevens,\nand I think, even if you don't look at the closing\nargument, which tells you two important things -- first\nof all, the prosecutor broke his promise to the judge\nthat he wouldn't mention it. He said as an officer of\nthe court, I will not mention it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does that have to do\nwith anything?\nMR. BRIGHT: It has to do with --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So he broke his promise. I\nmean sue him or something, but I don't see how it has\nanything to do with whether a fair jury was -- was --\nMR. BRIGHT: It has to do with his\ncredibility, which is very much what Batson is about.\nBut -- but to the O. J. Simpson case, I think the\nprosecutor's obsession with O. J. Simpson -- a month\nbefore he mentions it in a pretrial hearing.\nThe defense moves to ask to quit referring\nto the O. J. Simpson case in the media; and, for\ngoodness sakes, Judge, don't let him refer to it before\nthe jury.\nAnd the -- the defense makes quite clear:\nThe polls show that the society is divided. This was\nten months ago that Simpson came down. It is a very\npolarizing case. The fact that he is mentioning it is\ngoing to inject racial prejudice into this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the\nexplanation that was given that this was referring to\nthe defendant's feigning emotional distress rather than\nanything to do with race?\nMR. BRIGHT: Well, I think, Chief Justice\nRoberts, it doesn't have anything to do with that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What doesn't have\nanything to do with it?\nMR. BRIGHT: The fact of whether or not\nMr. Snyder was, in fact, suicidal is not rebutted in any\nway by bringing in the most racially polarizing case in\nthe country and saying that Simpson was trying to get\naway with it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's not just\nracially polarizing. I mean maybe it is that, but it is\nalso a case in which a man killed his wife with a knife.\nMR. BRIGHT: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The same as here.\nMR. BRIGHT: Well, there are a lot of\nsimilarities.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And then feigned a mental\nillness by his -- his great-escape escapade, and that is\n-- that is what the prosecutor said he was trying to\nbring before the jury.\nMR. BRIGHT: Well -- and he said Simpson got\naway with it. Snyder couldn't have possibly known that,\nbecause the verdict in Simpson didn't come down until\nafter Snyder's crime had been committed.\nSo he couldn't have been imitating, if that\nis what he was arguing -- he couldn't have been\nimitating O. J. Simpson. I -- I think what this\nprosecutor learned from O.J. Simpson, Justice Stevens,\nis that you don't let blacks on the jury.\nI mean I think he saw that this racially\nmixed jury in Los Angeles let him -- quote -- \"get away\nwith it,\" and we're going to have an all-white jury here\nin Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. And unlike what\nhappened out there, we're not going to let -- of course,\nthis was at the penalty phase. He could only get life\nwithout parole or the death penalty. He wasn't going to\nget away with anything. But that was the way it was\npictured to the jury: That if they didn't give him the\ndeath penalty, he would get away with it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the relief you\nare requesting goes only to the penalty and not to the\nconviction?\nMR. BRIGHT: No, Chief Justice Roberts.\nThis was in striking the jury, and there's no prejudice\nrequirement with race. Allen Snyder is entitled to a\nnew trial with a fair jury that represents the\ncommunity. So I think that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though -- even\nthough your theory is that it was only with respect to\nthe penalty that the bias -- you have no allegation --\nMR. BRIGHT: Oh, no.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that this jury\ndid not return a valid conviction. I thought your\nobjection was with respect to the death penalty.\nMR. BRIGHT: No. Let me -- let me make this\nquite clear. Our objection is that when the jury was\nselected, in terms of the disparate questioning,\ndisparate acceptance, failure to ask any questions,\nracial prejudice infected the selection of the jury.\nAll the O. J. Simpson case does is put a little icing on\nthe cake. But if you look at the Miller-El factors and\nyou consider them cumulatively, like Justice Kimball did\nin her dissent, you come away once again with what the\nCourt said in Miller-El. The evidence is too powerful.\nIt all points in one direction, and that's intentional\nrace discrimination. And that was in the jury. And if\nthat happened, Allen Snyder is entitled to a new trial.\nIf I could, I'd reserve the rest of my time.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Bright.\nMr. Boudreaux.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TERRY M. BOUDREAUX\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nI had some prepared remarks to begin with,\nbut I think I'd like to go straight into responding to\nsome of the concerns that have just been raised.\nFirst of all, concerning Elaine Scott, the\nlady who said \"I think I could.\" I think the record is\nquite clear that she was being asked about considering\nlife imprisonment. Beginning at 364 of the joint\nappendix, the question is asked by the prosecutor four\ntimes: \"Could you consider a sentence of life\nimprisonment?\" \"Could you consider the possibility of\nlife imprisonment?\" \"Could you consider life\nimprisonment?\" \"It is whether you could consider life\nimprisonment.\" You get to Ms. Scott, the answer is \"I\ncould.\" She's the lady who said originally, \"I think I\ncould.\" So the prosecutor's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As to life imprisonment or\nas to the death penalty?\nMR. BOUDREAUX: As to life imprisonment,\nYour Honor. As to death, she said \"I think I could.\"\nWhen it got to life imprisonment, the full question\nasked four times, among various -- going down the list\n-- is when she said --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is this? I -- 364?\nShow me --\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Beginning at 364 of the\njoint appendix, Your Honor. I just wanted to point out\nthe question posed is regarding life imprisonment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: She was originally asked the\nquestion about the death penalty, and her response was\nthe \"I think I could.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Bright contrasts\nthat with the more probing inquiry with respect to white\njurors who said \"I think I could,\" and here there was no\nfollow-up.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: That's true, Your Honor. In\n-- in reviewing this record, there are instances where\n-- where there were not a lot of follow-up questions.\nWe see the situation with Mr. Brooks. This jury, unlike\nthe jury in Miller-El, which took five weeks, this jury\ntook less than a day and a half to pick. So there were\nnot a lot of probing questions.\nJUSTICE ALITO: The explanation for\nMr. Brooks is not terribly convincing on its face. This\nis -- was an incredibly short trial, was it not?\nMr. Brooks is voir dired on Tuesday. And there's a\ndeath verdict on Friday.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And the concern -- the major\nconcern about him is that he's going to worry about\nmissing Wednesday, Thursday, Friday student teaching?\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, sir. But you see --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you compare him to some\nof the white jurors, particularly, I think, Mr. Laws.\nMr. Laws seemed to have a more compelling reason to be\nworried about not being -- about being in court. He was\na contractor. He had houses he had to finish. His wife\nhad recently had surgery. He was taking kids back and\nforth to the school.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, sir. Mr. Laws, like\nMr. Brooks, I think it's good to point out, approached\nthe bench of his own volition. Other -- other\nindividuals waited until they -- if they were called and\nwere questioned. The way the proceedings began, when\nthe venire were summoned into the courtroom, the judge\nintroduced the staff, read the statutory requirements\nfor jury service, and then they started lining up. And\none of the people lining up to express his concern, not\njust about meeting the requirements to be a juror, was\n\"I've got class, I've got\" -- and I think it's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Laws was an\nidentical -- he came up too. He said --\nMR. BOUDREAUX: He did come up, and I think\nthe distinction there, Your Honor, is that like several\nof others, unlike Mr. Brooks, in the end he said \"I can\nmake arrangements. I can deal with it.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I go back to Ms. Scott?\nMR. BOUDREAUX: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Could I go back to Ms.\nScott?\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Ms. Scott?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. If you look at the\ntop of 367 and then you look over at 366, the format, I\nthink, is that the prosecutor is posing a general\nquestion. And then he poses his question -- or she --\nand goes around and gets an answer. Here is Mr. Lindey.\nSo they start out with the death penalty. They have\nsome ambiguous thing at the bottom of 366. Then the\nprosecutor says, \"Mrs. Alvarez -- Ms. Alvarez, you said\nyou could not impose the death penalty.\" \"Mrs. Goff --\nMs. Goff: I could consider the death penalty.\" \"Ms.\nDuPont: I couldn't hear.\" Prosecutor: You could\nconsider both?\" \"Yes, I would consider it.\" \"Ms.\nDuBois: I could consider it. Yes.\" \"Ms. Archonie: I\ncould consider it.\" \"Mrs. Alvino: I could consider\nit.\" \"Ms. Scott: I could. I could.\"\nNow, that doesn't seem too ambiguous for me\n-- to me. It seems that what they're talking about,\neach of them, is the death penalty because that's what,\nby the time they got to the top of 367, they were\ntalking about. Maybe there's ambiguity there.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: I don't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I haven't noticed in\nanybody's opinion, so far, making that point that you\njust made.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: I would submit that -- that\nwould indicate ambiguity, Your Honor, that the\nprosecutor starts off with the life imprisonment\nquestion, and then it sort of morphed into a death\npenalty. But, by the time you get back to Ms. Scott --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No -- well, there's -- I\njust read you what it was, so I guess people make up\ntheir own mind about that. But by -- what I don't think\nyou can make up your own mind as ambiguous is when this\nprosecutor met with an answer that he considered not --\ncall it strictly kosher, when he found that, like Mrs.\nCalligan, she said, \"I'm not sure.\" That's more\nambiguous than Mrs. Scott. And then he goes on, for\nthree pages of additional questioning, and then 26 pages\nlater, he doesn't excuse her yet and he doesn't excuse\nher until she volunteers, \"I could give a verdict -- I\ndon't think I could give a verdict to take someone's\nlife.\"\nAnd it's at that point that the prosecutor\nexcuses her.\nNow, compare that to Ms. Scott, who started\nout saying \"I think I could\" and then, as I read it,\nsaid \"I could.\" Now, that's the kind of comparison\nhere. No follow-up. At the worst, minor ambiguity.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, Your Honor. What --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And a slight hesitation.\nNow, what do you say to that?\nMR. BOUDREAUX: One of the weaknesses in\nsome these jurors is a lack of follow-up questions. But\nI think we go back to her original comment, which was so\nsoftly spoken that the defense attorney said \"I can't\nhear you.\" There's nothing --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that, of course, is a\nproblem I have generally in this area. We can always\nimagine that things that are not in the transcript,\nperhaps what she said spokenly not in the transcript is\n\"I hate the death penalty. I'll never -- I'll never\napply it under any circumstances.\" And I grant you, if\nthat's the law, we are never going to find that there's\nany prejudice. But I just don't see how that could be\nthe law.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: In the totality of her\nresponses, the ones that were heard which are on the\nrecord and the ones which were not heard which are not\non the record, the prosecutor felt that she was weak on\nthe death penalty. And that on its face is a\nrace-neutral reason.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, of course -- sorry.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Well, I would just say that\nthe -- we're talking here with the prosecutor's\nperception of the juror based on her answers and the the\ntrial court's perception in evaluating the prosecutor's\nproper race-neutral reasons.\nCould someone look at this and say it's to\nthe contrary? Yes. But in the -- in the totality of\nthe circumstances and the reviewing for clear error with\nthe benefit, of course, that the trial court has in\nbeing present, hearing or not hearing what was said, the\ntone of voice, the demeanor, the mannerisms, the\ndeference's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There -- there isn't much\nreason, is there, to think that the trial court was\nbeing very critical of the prosecutor's answers? My\nrecollection is that, after the O. J. Simpson remark had\nbeen made in final argument, that the ultimate\nresolution of that involved the trial judge saying that\none reason that was not a racially significant remark\nwas that the prosecutor had neither -- had mentioned\nneither the race of the defendant nor the race of O. J.\nSimpson.\nNow that is not a critical mind at work, is\nit?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BOUDREAUX: I would -- I would suppose\nnot, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And because --\nMR. BOUDREAUX: The objection was --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And because you suppose not\nand I certainly suppose not, the -- the fact is that we\nhave to -- we have to consider the O. J. Simpson remark\nin trying to evaluate what went on, in trying to\nevaluate, for example, the lack of critical follow-up in\n-- in a disparate way by the prosecutor. And that, in\nfact, is a fair and potent argument that the other side\nhas, isn't it?\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, Your Honor. I would\nlike to respond to that by pointing out, though, that\nthe reference to the O. J. Simpson case was based on the\nfactual similarities involving the O. J. Simpson case\nand this case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you believe that, if\nthere had been a white defendant here, the O. J. Simpson\ncase would have been mentioned?\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, Your Honor, and I\nbelieve if the O.J. Simpson case --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: See, I'd be candid -- I\nwill be candid to say to you, under the -- under the\ncircumstances of the record in front of us, I find that\nhighly unlikely. And because I find that highly\nunlikely, I put significance in the O. J. Simpson remark\nwhich even you concede is significant.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, Your Honor. But I\nthink the -- the reason it doesn't fatally infect the\nproceedings with racism is -- I think the comment would\nhave been made had O. J. Simpson not been white -- I\nthink perhaps the comment would have been made had it\nnot been O. J. Simpson but some other high-profile white\nathlete celebrity; and I think it is appropriate,\nputting aside for the moment the assurance to the court\nthat he wouldn't mention it -- but it was in response to\nthe defense counsel's argument. This defendant was\ntried on a plea of not by season of insanity. The\nmurders are committed; several hours later he's\nbarricaded in his house, calls the police claiming to be\nsuicidal; the police respond.\nHe gets up, unbarricades the door, lets the\npolice in; then goes back into his fetal position. To\nrebut the -- this perhaps he's thinking, and I think it\nis significant in Defense Exhibit 2 at trial, what --\nthe defendant's statement taken several hours later,\nhe's oriented; he's aware of the situation; he knew he\nhad done something wrong, was in -- and was in trouble.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Boudreaux, even\nif -- even if you're correct that a neutral explanation\nwas given focusing on the emotional distress, are you --\ndo you think the prosecutor would have made the analogy\nif there had been a black juror on the jury?\nMR. BOUDREAUX: I think he would have, Your\nHonor. I know the contention is that he didn't, but I\nthink the facts are clear on this record that it was not\nan appeal to race, but it was an appeal to what was a\nhistorical fact, common knowledge among most people in\nthe country, and the facts of this case. The\ndefendant's statement as I said would betray no mental\nlack of wherewithal. When the search warrant was\nexecuted his bloody shirt was found in the attic of his\nhouse. That's at page 1311 of the record. It is not in\nthe -- it's not in the joint appendix. But when the\ndefense attorney brings up the police coming to the\nhouse and -- and he agreed that the police officer's\ntestimony was correct, he's in a fetal position; he's\nsaying they're coming to get me, I'm suicidal, the\ndefense attorney is bringing up the mental aspects of\nthis case. So I think it was appropriate for the\nprosecutor to look at the record and -- and to rebut\nthat.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Before -- before the\nrebuttal, this prosecutor was going around advertising\nthis as his O. J. Simpson case, and the defense attorney\nsaid please, Judge, get him to stop saying that. This\nis long before -- you are painting a picture of someone\nwho was answering an argument made by the defense, but\nthis prosecutor initiated it, and the defense attorney\nwas reacting. She said judge, he's talking in this\ncounty, that county about this is his O. J. Case; stop\nhim from doing that.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then he says I'm an\nofficer of the court, and I'm giving you my word.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: That's correct; and then he\nbelieves -- despite his assurances, when the defense\nattorneys made the argument they made, they were\ninviting that -- that response.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you -- do you\nbelieve that it would have been appropriate at that\npoint for the prosecutor to invoke in his argument any\ncase from any state in which a criminal defendant had\nunsuccessfully feigned insanity as a reason to decide --\nfor the jurors to decide that this defendant is -- is\nfeigning insanity?\nMR. BOUDREAUX: I think any historical fact\nwell known to people would have been fair game. Just as\nan analogy, remember this situation. The jury is\ninstructed, argument of counsel is not evidence; take it\nfor what you think it's worth. This was the historical\nreference this prosecutor used: The facts are similar.\nContrast that with the -- or -- kind of,\nalmost similar to that when we're talking about racism\nbeing part of these proceedings, one of the amicus\nbriefs refers to David Duke. If Your Honor is not\naware, in New Orleans, Louisiana, for a number of years\nDavid Duke is high profile Ku Klux Klan. In some of the\nvoir dire in this case, at page 221, 222 of the joint\nappendix, it is defense counsel who brings up David\nDuke.\nNow you understand if David Duke was on\ntrial here today and we had a photo album of him in his\nrobes, he would still be entitled to a fair trial. So\nshe's using --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Exactly. He's entitled to\na fair trial without prejudice.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I think you have two\ninstances here. One is Mrs. Scott, and the other is Mr.\nBrooks. And with regard to Mr. Brooks, what I've read\nin the transcript is that he was nervous and unhappy,\nbecause he's learning to be a teacher, and he's afraid\nhe's going to miss some student teaching time which will\ncount against him.\nMR. BRIGHT: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What it says is the clerk\ncalled the dean and the dean said it he won't, don't\nworry about it, which Mr. Brook is then told. He's\nchallenged for that reason. He might still worry about\nit. But Mr. Laws is not. And Mr. Laws is a\nself-employed contractor who announced to the court, I\nhave a big problem this weekend; two houses are near\ncompletion, the owners are supposed to be moving in; my\nwife has just had a hysterectomy, she's supposed to be\ntaking care of the children back home, and I -- she has\nnobody to help.\nOkay? He's not challenged.\nSo we're not worried about Mr. Laws worried\nabout his wife and his business which going down -- you\nknow, serious. But we are worried about Mr. Brooks, who\nhas been told by the dean you have no problem. Now,\nthat's a little bit of a problem to me.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you add them up, we have\nMs. Scott we have Mr. Brooks, we have the mention of --\nand three others -- three others, the only other three\nblack people are challenged off, and we have the -- no\nblack juror us on and we have the references to O. J.\nSimpson beside.\nOkay? All right so, there you are. Full\ncase against you.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Your characterizations are\n-- are correct, Your Honor. I won't dispute the factual\nallegations, but the key thing to point out there is\nMr. Laws said he could make arrangements. It is\ndifficult; it's -- the jury duty happens.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What's the difference\nbetween that and \"okay\"?\nMR. BOUDREAUX: I'm sorry?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One says I can make\narrangements, and the other is more economical and he\nsays \"okay.\"\nMR. BOUDREAUX: But that -- he said -- I\nthink that's the landscape man, he said, as long as it\nwasn't a prolonged -- as.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, she means the dean.\nThe dean --\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Oh, the dean --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- said no problem at all.\nWhat better arrangement can you want?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- meaning Brooks.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Brooks says --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Brooks says okay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The difference is between\n\"I can make arrangements\" and \"okay.\"\nMR. BOUDREAUX: The difference -- difference\nthere, Your Honor, is that Mr. Brooks needs to make\nthese classroom -- undergraduate requirements to\ngraduate. There's a day that's going to come when he's\neither made his requirements to graduate, or he has not.\nThe people with the jobs, the contractors, their jobs\nare there when they got -- when they got out of court,\nwhen trial was over. If Mr. Brooks didn't meet his\nrequirements, he was not going to graduate. And I would\nbe a little careful to take it as face value from the\njudge's law clerk calling the dean who then -- she comes\nback and says it is a 300-hour observation. That's\nobviously wrong.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I wouldn't take it at\nface value if there had been a further question asked of\nMr. Brooks saying, are you really satisfied you have\nnothing to worry about? And he says well, gee, boy, I\nsure hope I -- I'm able to make that requirement. But\nnobody asked that question.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Nobody asked that question.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All we have is got is\n\"okay\" on the one hand and \"I can make arrangements\" on\nother.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: We also have, Your Honor, as\nfar as the question of Mr. Brooks is concerned, a fact\nthat is not articulated by the prosecutor but which\nwould be supported by the record. He's an education\nteacher; he's young; prosecutors in a death penalty case\nI think would shy away from asking or leaving on a jury\na young person. A teacher, maybe perhaps more\nsympathetic, maybe more understanding -- nothing wrong\nwith that, but maybe that's not who a prosecutors\nseeking a death penalty --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we -- we have to\ngo -- your -- this is enough of a fact-specific inquiry\nfor any appellate court, even when we go into the\nallegations that the prosecution did make.\nNow you're saying we also have to imagine\nother reasons, which he didn't state were the reasons\nwhy he struck, but which might have been. You really\nthink that that's enough to --\nMR. BOUDREAUX: That's the problem with this\nrecord. The State says --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is not the problem with\nit. It is your problem with the record.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is not mine.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: The plausibility of the\nprosecutor's reasons stand or fall on what he says. The\nother things perhaps the court will say he didn't say\nthat; we're not going to consider them.\nBut talking about a fact -- factual specific\ninquiry before an appellate court, that brings us back\nto the -- to the discretion afforded the -- not the\ndiscretion, Your Honor, the deference afforded the trial\ncourt who is present for the proceedings, who is there,\npassive or otherwise. He's there. He sees what's going\non, the demeanor --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you about Juror\nHawkins. You haven't talked much about him.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Hawkins?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why did they strike him?\nHe seemed to me to be a pretty good juror for the\nprosecution.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Your Honor, that's a\nquestion I've asked myself; and I can't -- I'm not --\nyou would think on the surface of it he would have been\na good juror for the State. What I think is equally\nclear is that the defense would -- objected to his being\nexcused but didn't make a Batson claim because I don't\nthink they wanted to go there. They would not have\nwanted that juror on their jury. He said he had --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Wasn't he struck before\nthey back-struck the first black on the jury?\nMR. BOUDREAUX: I believe so, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So that probably explains\nwhy they didn't make a Batson objection.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, you're correct about\nthat. But I think he would have not -- the jurors --\nthe defense perhaps would have struck him. He testified\nthat he had plenty friends who were police officers in\nthis jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand why the\ndefense would have struck him. I'm trying to understand\nwhy the prosecutor --\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Well, we don't know that,\nYour Honor, because there was no Batson objection\nraised, and the prosecutor was not called upon to\narticulate any reasons.\nOn the face of it, he looks like he could be\na good juror. But that's a factual matter that the\ntrial prosecutor, then and there, made that decision.\nAnd I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He knew nothing about that\njuror except what Justice Stevens and you have just been\nreciting. If that's all you knew and you were a\nprosecutor, would you have struck him? Would you have\nsaid: I don't want -- I don't want anybody on this jury\nwho's got friends in the police department? Would you\nhave struck him for that reason?\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Well, I can say, Your Honor,\nthat's not the first time that's happened over years in\ndifferent -- different trials that I've reviewed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How about you?\nMR. BOUDREAUX: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would you -- would you have\ngotten rid of him? Would you have said: I don't want\nany cop lovers on my jury?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BOUDREAUX: No, Your Honor. I would --\nI would --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, you wouldn't have, and\nneither would I.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: No, sir. And that's the\ndifficulty that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: We have no idea -- we have\nno idea what this man looked like. We have no idea\nabout his demeanor, his tone of voice. This could have\nbeen -- there could have been very legitimate reasons\nfor doing it. There could be no legitimate reasons for\ndoing it.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But nobody asked what reason\nfor doing it was.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: And no reasons were offered.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know the answer to\nthis at all but how this is supposed to work? A defense\nattorneys -- the jury selection, and he sees that the\nprosecutor doesn't challenge for peremptory or any other\nreason one black member. Let's call it five.\nAnd then they start challenging black\nmembers. Obviously, he didn't at the beginning impose\nany Batson claim. He had no Batson claim. There were\nfive people on the jury who were black. What claim\ncould you make?\nAnd then after you begin to get suspicious\nand start to make them, now they do this thing called\nblack strike and they get everybody off the jury.\nHow is it supposed to work?\nMR. BOUDREAUX: I would disagree they would\nnot have a Batson claim to make when the first black is\nstruck if they felt there was evidence of that one --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They don't know.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The rule is not that you\ncan't -- so long as you have some black on the jury, you\ncan strike the rest.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: No, sir.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Any single person.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm speaking reality.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: That's why you don't have to\nwait for a pattern. Let's say you have an all black\njury.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I still have -- I am\ncurious to the answer to Justice Breyer's question.\nWhen they go back and back strike at that point can the\ndefendant say I don't think you can back strike this\njuror you're doing it on the basis of race.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: They can go back and back\nstrike, but the defendant could say --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They can go back and\nback strike.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, sir.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They can go back and\nobject to the back striking? The State would say, well\nhere's the reasons we're back striking.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: The back strike is when is\nthe challenge exercised. In and of itself you can't say\nif it is racial or not. It is a challenge.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That was my question.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: My problem -- after the\nback strike of the first black juror who had been\naccepted, can they thereafter renew an objection if the\njurors two and three, who are accepted on the assumption\nthat there would no --\nMR. BOUDREAUX: I think under Miller-El and\nrelated decisions that would be part of the totality of\nthe circumstances. The practical problem --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That wasn't done here.\nThat was the point that you made.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When the third -- the\nback strike of Brooks was made, they could have gone\nback for Hawkins and the others, but they didn't.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: That could have been argued\nevidence for them to make their prima facie case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry.\nThere's some ambiguity in your answer.\nMiller-El says others who were struck can be considered\nas part of the totality. My question is -- can they go\nback and object not only to the back struck juror, but\nas Justice Stevens points out, to the others who weren't\nobjected to perhaps because there wasn't a black person\non the jury?\nMR. BOUDREAUX: To give you a yes or no\nanswer, yes. The practical problem with that is those\ntwo jurors having previously been excused, could be on\nthe way to their office or back to their home.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Still, the\nprosecutor is still there. You can ask the prosecutor,\nwhy did you strike that juror?\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, you could. Yes, you\ncould. Then you have got a practical problem what if it\ndoesn't pass muster. That's the reason for the\ncontemporaneous objection rule.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you one other\nquestion. You are the only one who will know the answer\nto, this too. I noticed in looking at the opinion of\nthe Louisiana Supreme Court that they start out by\nsaying we have conducted another review of the voir dire\ntranscript and find nothing there to disparage the\nBatson claim. In reading that opinion in several places\nthey refer to their having gone back and having read the\nwhole transcript themselves.\nAnd then they have two full pages, or one\nand a half anyway where they seem to be talking about\nwhat happened in a pretrial conference and they refer to\nthat prior review and covered a factor favorable to the\nState's use of a peremptory challenge.\nThey went back and found a factor of\nfavorable to. Now, was that factor argued to them in\nthe brief? Do you remember that?\nMR. BOUDREAUX: I wrote the brief, Your\nHonor, but I don't think -- I don't remember.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought that's why you\nmight know.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BOUDREAUX: I don't remember.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought that, in reading\nit, it seems as if they are not, and I was thinking\nabout how a judge can't think of everything. But if\nthey're going to think beyond what the briefs tell them,\nthey ought to think of it for both sides, and not just\nfor one side.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: You know to be honest,\nJustice Scalia's comment about looking at the record and\nsaying oh, here is another reason that the prosecutor\ndidn't articulate.\nSimilarly, Your Honor, in reference to the\nThomas Hawkins being struck with no objections -- there\nwas -- Greg Scott was a black juror of peremptory struck\nby the State. Again with no objection. If you want to\ntalk about -- if we're talking about two or five here,\nlittle weight should be given to the exercise of those\ntwo. Greg Scott -- again like the other juror, I don't\nthink was going to survive the challenge by the defense.\nHis wife was the victim of a carjacking, and he said if\nhe was a defendant and he was innocent, he would\ntestify. He would need to testify.\nAnd in this case, the defendant did not\ntestify at either phase of the proceedings.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Boudreaux, I'd like\nto ask you a question before you finish. It is not an\nissue in this case, but we are told that\nAfrican-Americans are 20 percent of the population of\nJefferson Parish, but they were less than 11 percent of\nthe people summoned for jury duty.\nIs that typical?\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Certainly pre-Katrina, Your\nHonor. Yes. The summons go out based on public\nrecords, driver licenses, voters registrations. That's\nbasically at random. To say those numbers would not\nsurprise me.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- and because\nit's almost half of what you would expect.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, and that's going to\nvary, you know, from venire to venire on any given day.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Thank you.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: In the minute or two I have\nleft, Your Honors, I would just remind the Court, urge\nthe Court to consider its recent opinion last June in\nUttecht dealing with the deference due the trial court\nin these types of proceedings -- that was a habeas case\n-- what the opinion says to require on direct review,\nand according to the trial court, the deference having\nbeen present and not just relying on a cold record, that\nthe Louisiana Supreme Court's ruling should be farmered.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think the deference\nin Uttecht, which was the death qualified juror --\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- should be any greater\nthan in a Batson case where we have the sensitive issue\nof racial discrimination?\nMR. BOUDREAUX: I'm not sure I understood\nthe question, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Uttecht --\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Whether it's going to the\nissue --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Uttecht was a death\nqualified juror --\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and this is a Batson\ncase.\nMR. BOUDREAUX: Right, and it --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because of our concerns in\nthe Batson area, do you think we're entitled to have a\ndifferent standard of deference for the trial court? I\nthink your --\nMR. BOUDREAUX: No. Because you're\nstill dealing with --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We haven't discussed\nthis --\nMR. BOUDREAUX: -- of a factfinder.\nObviously, there's some differences in Uttecht being\nhabeas and Witherspoon, but the similarities, I think,\nare enough that this -- the degree of deference has to\nstill be there, although there's a statutory deference\nin a habeas.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Boudreaux.\nMr. Bright, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BRIGHT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BRIGHT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIf I could just say, first of all about,\nthis backstrike, because what we see here is after\nElaine Scott is struck, that's State number 6, the very\nnext peremptory strike by the State it, number 7, is to\ngo back and backstrike Jeffrey Brooks.\nNow, notice that with regard to the other\nfour backstrikes used, two by the prosecution and two by\nthe defense, it's at the very end of the process. It's\nliterally when they're down to one juror. Williams\nsays, \"Do we have 11 jurors?\" And then he backstrikes.\nThe defense says, \"Is this my 11th strike?\" Backstrike.\nWilliams then, \"Are we back to 11?\" So these -- the\nonly way the backstrike makes sense really, when you\nthink about it, is to look at the whole jury and then go\nback and cull out the ones based on a comparison.\nBut once Brooks had kept them from striking\nMr. Scott, who as Mr. Boudreaux pointed out, his wife\nwas robbed at gunpoint, said he would testify if he were\na defendant in a case and was innocent. And then as\nJustice Stevens pointed out, Hawkins, who was -- had\ngrown children, engineer, friends in the police\ndepartment -- these two are not struck -- but then once\nElaine Scott is struck, the third back and the Batson\nchallenge is made, we don't have any use for Jeffrey\nBrooks anymore, so he's -- the backstrike is used in\nthat way.\nAnd I think, again, when you look at all the\nrelevant circumstances, it's pretty clear what was going\non here with the acceptance of Brooks at the start and\nthe backstrike --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree with\nyour friend on the other side, that you could have\nobjected both to the backstruck juror and to the jurors\nto whom you -- with respect to whom you did not object\nbecause there was -- the juror that was later backstruck\non the jury?\nMR. BRIGHT: I -- I think yes. The answer\nto that is yes, and I think, if the defense had, we'd be\ntalking about four jurors here today instead of two.\nBut it doesn't diminish from what the Court in Miller-El\ncalled the numbers. The fact that it is unlikely to be,\nby chance, that all five -- all five African-Americans\nare struck in this case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Although you could have\nmade an objection. As I understand your opponent, he\nvery helpfully said that they probably would have left\nthe courthouse --\nMR. BRIGHT: They would.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So what could you --\nMR. BRIGHT: So they're gone. And so if the\nobjection had been overruled --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The objection would\nhave afforded the state an opportunity to present the --\nif there was one -- the non-racial reason THAT they\nstruck the juror.\nMR. BRIGHT: But the reason for doing that\nwould be to have the judge not allow the strike and to\nput that juror in the box and the juror' gone now. So\nthat, as a practical matter, is not going to work.\nThere's no --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Another reason to do it\nwould be to preserve your right on appeal, to object to\nthose jurors.\nMR. BRIGHT: But there's no procedural rule\nin Louisiana that says you have to do that. It might\nhave been a stronger case if they had done it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe your rule here that\n-- that we're not going to postulate the worst reason\nfor a prosecutorial strike rather than a good reason\nwhen you haven't given the prosecution an opportunity to\nset forth a good reason.\nMR. BRIGHT: If I may answer.\nThat only goes, though -- the only two\njurors on the reasons that are before the Court are\nJeffrey Brooks and Elaine Scott. But the fact that the\nprosecutor struck all five, and as Justice Souter points\nout, you wouldn't have made this argument, I don't think\n-- this O.J. Simpson argument -- not only depending upon\nthe race of the defendant, but if there had been black\npeople on that jury. This is an argument that resonates\nwith an all-white jury.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Bright.\n"
