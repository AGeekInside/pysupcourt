        "content": "(11:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in Number 02-306, the Beneficial National Bank versus\nMarie Anderson.\nMr. Waxman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe complaint in this case alleges that a\nnational bank charged excessive interest. This Court has\nheld repeatedly and consistently since 1875 that\nsection 30 of the National Bank Act of 1864 provides both\nthe exclusive standards governing the interest that a\nnational bank may charge and the exclusive judicial\nremedies for any violation.\nAnd as a result, any claim that a national bank\ncharged excessive interest necessarily arises under\nFederal law, whether that claim is brought in State court\nor Federal court. Any well-pleaded complaint would\nreflect that, and therefore, any claim of usury against a\nnational bank, whether pleaded well or mistakenly or\ndeceptively, falls within the original jurisdiction of the\nFederal courts and may either be filed there by a\nplaintiff or removed there by a defendant.\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, normally when the Federal\nGovernment creates a cause of action that preempts State\ncauses of action, it attaches an element to that cause of\naction that does not exist under some of the State causes\nof action. Let's say, it -- it creates a cause of action\nagainst the owners and -- and managers of nuclear\nfacilities, but the cause of action must be based on\nsomething more than mere negligence. It has to be\nintentional malfeasance or gross negligence. Okay?\nNow, what if somebody comes in and brings a\ncause of action in State court, alleging mere negligence\nby the owners of the nuclear facility? Is it your\nposition that that case is removable even though it\nwouldn't -- it wouldn't survive a motion to dismiss for\nfailure to state a claim under -- under Federal law?\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, with respect, I\ndon't think that I would concede the premise of your\nquestion, that is, that a Federal cause of action\nordinarily has an additional element.\nQUESTION: All right. Well --\nMR. WAXMAN: But leaving that aside --\nQUESTION: Leaving -- in my hypothetical --\ncreate one --\nMR. WAXMAN: Your -- your hypothetical actually\nis an example of a very peculiar instance in which, with\nrespect to nuclear incidents, Congress has imported in --\nhas federalized the cause. It created an express Federal\ncause of action --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. WAXMAN: -- and said expressly that State\nlaw standards will apply and it will be the law of\nwhatever State the incident occurred.\nQUESTION: But take my hypothetical. What do\nyou do in my hypothetical? Is it removable or not?\nMR. WAXMAN: If -- if --\nQUESTION: Yes or no.\nMR. WAXMAN: If -- if any -- I hope I can\nremember your hypothetical. The --\nQUESTION:\nlaw cause of action that does not claim all of the\nelements which are necessary for the Federal cause of\naction. So it's clear on the face of it that it is\ndismissable.\nMR. WAXMAN: It is definitely removable. It\ndefinitely is completely preempted if it comes within the\nscope of a cause of action that has been determined to be\nexclusive. Now, that's --\nQUESTION: It's very strange to say that you can\nremove something that on its face does not constitute a\nFederal cause of action.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, there may -- in\npreemption cases, there are line-drawing problems at the\nmargins about whether something is or isn't preempted.\nThis is a heartland case and the example -- the\nhypothetical you're giving is let's say that State of\nAlabama or the State of Delaware created strict liability\nfor excessive interest. The Federal statute says it has\nto be knowingly under section 86. There is no question --\nno question -- under this Court's decided cases that a\nclaim that a national bank charged excessive interest,\nwith whatever state of mind or lack of state of mind, is\ngoverned exclusively by Federal standards and an exclusive\nFederal cause of action and that --\nQUESTION:\nthe consequence of that is that the State law cause of\naction must be dismissed by the State court because it's\npreempted, or rather, the consequence is that you can\nremove into Federal court a pleading that plainly on its\nface does not -- does not claim a Federal cause of action.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, the --\nQUESTION: It just seems very strange to me.\nMR. WAXMAN: The -- the pleading -- the\ncomplaint in this case on its face does satisfy the\nFederal cause of action and --\nQUESTION: I understand that. I understand\nthat. We're -- we're not talking about what happens here.\nBut I -- with regard to the general principle that you\nwant us to set forth.\nMR. WAXMAN: I think --\nQUESTION: That's -- what's -- what I'm\nconcerned about. Is it that all cases automatically come,\nor is it only those that -- that set forth a Federal cause\nof action?\nMR. WAXMAN: It has to be one that if well\npleaded -- I mean, a -- on a removal -- on a notice of\nremoval, the Federal court is obligated, like any court\ndetermining its own jurisdiction, to read the complaint as\nif it were well pleaded. And if, when the court reads the\ncomplaint, it says there is a Federal question necessarily\npresented in here which has been inartfully not pleaded,\nthe court then proceeds to adjudicate on the merits that\nclaim. If the answer is no, if the answer is, hey, this\nguy pleaded a claim under State law and I have well\npleaded it and it still doesn't raise a Federal question,\nthen you remand.\nAnd it's that -- that's sort of -- I didn't mean\nto quibble with you, but the principle that we suggest is\nvery straightforward is simply an application of this\nCourt's decided jurisprudence, under arising-under\njurisdiction, that removal jurisdiction follows original\njurisdiction.\nQUESTION: Mr. -- Mr. Waxman, is what you're\nsaying essentially there is a Federal claim or there is no\nclaim? Certainly the plaintiff doesn't want there to be\nno claim. If there is a claim, it is necessarily Federal.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: And that's what makes it removable.\nIt is treated as though it were well pleaded, when, in\nfact, it's badly pleaded.\nMR. WAXMAN: Indeed. And the -- the perplexing\nthing about this case is the sort of almost Kafkaesque\nsituation that we have that's exemplified by the amicus\nbriefs on both sides where this particular instance where\nthe plaintiff says usury under State law even though the\nSupreme -- this -- this Court has decided, since 11 years\nafter the act was passed in the Civil War, that there is\nno such State claim, we now have a -- a group of\nplaintiffs' lawyers from California urging this Court to\nestablish a right to plead something that in their own\ncase they say is only, quote, defensively preempted.\nQUESTION: If they had --\nMR. WAXMAN: And no one has -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: If they had pled it correctly, they\ncould still be in State court, but the defendant could\nremove. In other words, this is not -- although it's a\nFederal claim -- it arises only under Federal law -- it\ncould be brought in State court or Federal court.\nMR. WAXMAN: Correct. There is concurrent\njurisdiction as there -- as is the norm, as this Court has\nexplained. And there are instances in which these cases\nare litigated to the merits in State court and instances\nin which they're litigated in Federal court either because\nthey're brought there by the plaintiff, as the plaintiff\ncould have here, or they're removed there as the\ndefendant.\nAnd the other principle that this case reflects,\nas I said, is not just the importance of parity in Federal\nquestion jurisdiction between giving plaintiffs and\ndefendants parity in invoking the Federal courts if they\nchoose, but the requirement that this Court has stated\nover and over and over again that in -- in determining its\nown jurisdiction, the Federal court will construe the\ncomplaint as well-pleaded.\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, one thing that troubles\nme about -- about the proposal that you make and that the\nGovernment makes is that it seems to me in the LMRA case\nthat established this principle and in the ERISA case,\nwhich is the only other case that has -- has held to the\nsame effect, those cases refer to this as being an\nextraordinary, an unusual event. But I don't think it's\ngoing to be an unusual event if we say that whenever there\nis created a Federal cause of action, and at the same\ntime, State causes of action are preempted, it may be\nremoved to Federal court. I don't think that will be\nunusual at all.\nAnd I sort of looked upon the -- the Labor\nManagement Relations Act case as really sort of a -- a\nplatypus, I mean, a very strange case in which the courts\njust didn't want these labor things to go into State\ncourts because they didn't trust State courts. And so\nthey said, boy, we're going to have Federal courts create\nthis whole new law of -- of contracting, of collective\nbargaining. That's how I always regarded it. And now\nyou're telling me it's really just a little piece of a\nmuch broader proposition which is not at all -- not at all\nnarrow.\nMR. WAXMAN: No. Justice Scalia, I think it\nactually is very, very narrow. And we can go through in\ndetail, but almost all of the statutory schemes that\nthe -- the State's amicus brief cites are not, in fact,\nexamples of complete preemption. But it -- it comes up\nonly in the instance where there is not only substantive\npreemption by Federal law and the creation of a Federal\ncause of action, but the determination that that cause of\naction is, in fact, exclusive. And that is the difficult\nand close question that this Court --\nQUESTION: Well, was -- was that true in the\nFarmers' and Mechanics' case? The -- the Court certainly\nsaid that when you're suing for usury, that was all you\ncould get with the -- that wasn't, of course, a -- a\nremoval case at all, was it?\nMR. WAXMAN: No, it wasn't a removal case. And\nin fact, depending on when in 1875 it was decided, there\nmay or may not have been --\nQUESTION: There wasn't Federal -- there wasn't\nFederal question jurisdiction.\nMR. WAXMAN: -- there may not have been removal.\nQUESTION: But it is not a white horse case for\nyou, that one.\nMR. WAXMAN: I think it is a -- if I understand\nthe reference, I think it is a white horse case in the\nsense -- in this sense, Mr. Chief Justice. We're not\ncontending that the 1864 act evinced an intent to make\nthese causes of action removable, even if pleaded under\nState law, because there was no general Federal question\njurisdiction, and it wasn't provided in the law.\nThe relevant question and the relevant question\nthat this Court deemed to be close in Metropolitan Life in\nthe ERISA context is whether -- okay, fine, Federal law\nhas substantively preempted the field or by conflict or\nwhatever. Is the creation of the Federal cause of action\nof such force that it should be deemed to be exclusive?\nAnd that, I think, is what this Court decided\nfirst in Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank by saying to the\nborrower in that case -- the borrower was maintaining that\nunder New York State law, it was entitled to void not --\nto forfeit not just the interest, but the note. And this\nCourt said, look, New York State law has nothing to do\nwith this. This is a claim of usury by a national bank.\nThe Federal standards are exclusive, and the Federal\npenalty expressly will not permit forfeiture of the note.\nOnly the interest.\nQUESTION: But -- but certainly under the -- the\nstatute itself did not preclude the possibility of that\naction having been brought in State court.\nMR. WAXMAN: Not at all. And in fact, it was\nexpressly contemplated. Then as now, these actions can be\nbrought and are often brought in State courts. All that\nthe --\nQUESTION: So can 3 -- 301 suits. The two cases\nthat we have so far where we have recognized that there is\nonly a Federal cause of action, that cause of action could\nhave been brought just as well in State court, but it's up\nto the defendant to remove it. So we're not talking about\nan exclusive Federal forum.\nMR. WAXMAN: That -- that's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. And the same is true for the types of ERISA\nclaims that were at issue in Metropolitan Life.\nQUESTION: And -- and I suppose one reason -- I\nwas surprised when I went through. I thought there would\nbe a whole lot of exclusive Federal cause of action,\nand -- and there are very few. But I suppose one of the\nreasons we don't get it very often is just what Justice\nGinsburg said. There are other provisions where there's\nan exclusive Federal forum.\nMR. WAXMAN: Correct. For example, the\nCopyright Act.\nQUESTION: Which is -- which is not this case.\nMR. WAXMAN:\nexample of complete preemption, but there's a statutory\nprovision that --\nQUESTION: Okay, why didn't we express this --\nthis principle before instead of -- instead of adhering so\nnarrowly? I mean, even the ERISA case, it didn't express\nthis -- this broad theory. It says, this is -- this is\nvery much like the section 301, and the legislative\nhistory referred specifically to 301, and therefore we\ncome out the same way. Pretty -- pretty narrow.\nMR. WAXMAN: Here's -- here's why, Justice\nScalia. The very difficult -- this Court made clear in\nMetropolitan Life, if it wasn't clear before, that it\nwasn't going to infer from congressional silence very\nlightly that when Congress created a Federal cause of\naction, it meant it to be exclusive so that it would\ndisplace State causes of action. There's a very strong\nand longstanding presumption to the contrary.\nBut that difficult question was decided in the\ncontext of section 30 of the National Bank Act beginning\nin 1875 for reasons that are explained in this Court's\nopinion and in the Comptroller's report that the\nGovernment cites that precipitated the enactment of\nsection 30, which is that this was war legislation. This\nwas a -- the creation of the national banks was hoped by\nCongress and President Lincoln that it would provide the\nmeans with which the Government could continue to fund the\nwar, and national banks would knit the country together\nwhen the war was finished.\nAnd the one thing that comes out of the history\nof this case and is reflected in this Court's opinions is\nthat they feared, based on their experience with the first\nbank of the United States and the second bank of the\nUnited States, that jealous States, States that were\njealous of their State-chartered banks, which were issuing\npaper at the time, would engage in predations against the\nnational banks that were created at the very same time\nthat section 30 was enacted and, in essence, smother this\nimportant Federal infant in its crib.\nQUESTION: I started to call you General Waxman.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Like the old days.\nMR. WAXMAN: R-18.\nQUESTION: Assume -- assume that I -- I agree\nwith you that -- that on -- on complete preemption,\nthis -- this case passes muster.\nBut assume also that in writing an opinion, I --\nI want to say something to indicate why we do not have a\ngathering snowball here. I mean, we -- first, we had the\nlabor management reporting.\ncases. Now we recognize this.\nIs there any criterion that you see in -- in at\nleast the cases on those three points so far, that --\nthat -- or any language that points to a criterion for\nwhen preemption, particularly field preemption, for\nexample, becomes complete and when it doesn't?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. There has to be\nsubstantive -- Congress has to supply the exclusive\nsubstantive standards. It has to create a cause of action\nto remedy violations of those standards, and this is the\nhard part. And it also has to make clear that that --\nthat judicial remedy is, in fact, exclusive, that is, that\nit will not permit the existence or operation of State law\ncauses of action, even those that import the Federal\nstandards and my --\nQUESTION: Okay. Why in other cases? Again,\nassume you -- you made your point on -- so far as this\nstatute is concerned. Why in other cases aren't courts\ngoing to be, in effect, remitted to doing what the -- the\nCourt tried to do here, and that is, say, let's find out\nwhat Congress had in mind? And we don't find anything in\nthe legislative history that makes it clear, and therefore\nit doesn't apply.\nMR. WAXMAN: You -- you have to find out what\nCongress had in mind, but I think this Court has made\nclear in Metropolitan Life that it is going to be the\nrare, rare, rare day when the Federal courts will infer\nfrom congressional silence that a Federal cause of action\nis to be exclusive.\nAnd the other examples in -- in which -- in the\nFederal law in which there is, in fact, complete\npreemption, the FELA or the Carmack Amendment as an\nexample, Congress has gone ahead and expressly made those\nactions nonremovable.\nMay I reserve the balance of my time?\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Waxman.\nMr. Roberts, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFor more than 125 years, it has been clear that\nthe National Bank Act provides the exclusive cause of\naction for a claim of usury against a national bank.\nBecause the National Bank Act provides the sole available\navenue of relief, any claim that a national bank has\ncommitted usury can arise only under that Federal law.\nThe National Bank --\nQUESTION:\nI asked Mr. Waxman? What if -- what if the pleading makes\na claim of usury, but it does not contain all of the\nelements necessary to make out a Federal cause of action?\nIs that removable?\nMR. ROBERTS: A failure to state a claim on\nwhich relief is granted does not deprive the Federal court\nof jurisdiction over the claim. So the simple failure to\nstate a claim wouldn't prevent it from being removable if\nthe -- if the claim was within the scope of the Federal\ncause of action, if it was a colorable claim.\nNow, if -- if the claim --\nQUESTION: Well, it's not colorable. I mean,\none of the elements is just not there.\nMR. ROBERTS: If -- if the claim was not\ncolorable --\nQUESTION: It -- it claims usury when -- when\nwhat they charged was 3 percent and that would not violate\nthe Federal statute.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, here -- here we -- we don't\nhave that situation, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I understand that. I want to know --\nMR. ROBERTS: That --\nQUESTION: We -- you're -- you're asking us to\nset forth a new general proposition, which we haven't set\nforth before.\nas distinctive cases. Now you want a general proposition.\nI want to know what does this general proposition cover.\nIs the State court going to have to -- or is --\nbefore removal is granted, is the court going to have to\ndecide whether a cause of action is properly stated, or --\nor, you know, whether -- whether it could be dismissed\non -- on a motion to dismiss?\nMR. ROBERTS: When it's removed, the Federal\ncourt decides whether there's jurisdiction under Federal\nlaw, whether there's arising-under jurisdiction, and\ndecides whether the -- the complaint is properly pleaded,\nthe true nature of the complaint states a claim under\nFederal law. And --\nQUESTION: So if it doesn't, then it stays in\nState court.\nMR. ROBERTS: If it doesn't, then it can remand\nthe State -- the case back to State court, but it would\nhave decided, in essence, that the claim should be\ndismissed at the same time by deciding --\nQUESTION: What happens -- what happens if the\ncause of action is for misrepresentation under State law,\nand the misrepresentation is that the interest rate was\nlawful and the plaintiff alleges it was unlawful because\nit was usurious?\nMR. ROBERTS:\nclaim requires the decision that a -- a determination that\nthere were excessive interest charges by a national bank,\nthen the claim would fall within the scope of the cause of\naction. But that wouldn't mean that there couldn't be\nclaims for misrepresentation that --\nQUESTION: Well, in -- in my -- would this\nremovable? This is the only thing in the complaint.\nMR. ROBERTS: The complaint --\nQUESTION: It seems to me this might be like\nGully in that it -- the -- the nature of the cause of\naction was really a State cause of action even though it\ninvolves an inquiry into what the Federal law --\nMR. ROBERTS: The State cause of action is just\nmisrepresentation.\nQUESTION: That's it.\nMR. ROBERTS: Then that would not be removable.\nQUESTION: It's unlawful, and the only\nmisrepresentation is it's unlawful and it's unlawful\nallegedly because it's usurious.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. I don't think that would be\nremovable, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: There were related claims here that\nwere strictly State claims.\nMR. ROBERTS: That -- that --\nQUESTION: But they fell into --\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, but the existence of pendent\nState claims doesn't defeat removal jurisdiction just as\nit doesn't defeat original jurisdiction. There were\npendent State claims in the Metropolitan Life case, yet --\nQUESTION: And they'd come up under 1367. They\nwould travel with the 13 --\nMR. ROBERTS: Exactly, Your Honor. The\nsupplemental jurisdiction statute, 1367, expressly\nprovides for Federal court jurisdiction in those\ninstances. They would come with -- with the claim to\nFederal court.\nQUESTION: But if you had this same complaint\nand it didn't have the usury claim and it just had those\nState law claims, then there's nothing removable.\nMR. ROBERTS: That's -- that's right, Your\nHonor. The -- the misrepresentation claim and the\nsuppression claim are both species of fraud claim under\nState law. They don't come within the -- the scope of the\ncause of action in the National Bank Act, and they're not,\non their own terms, arise under Federal law and they would\nnot be removable.\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, can I go back to your\nanswer to Justice Scalia's question? I wonder if you\nreally meant the answer you gave.\nAssume a case in which the plaintiff alleges\nthat 3 percent is usurious as a matter of Alabama law, and\nunder Federal law it must be at least 5 percent, say. As\nI understand it, that would be removable because he's\nmaking a usury claim and would be dismissable, that is,\nunder your -- your theory of the case. But I thought you\nsaid that would have to be dismissed in State court.\nMR. ROBERTS: What -- what -- I tried to\ndistinguish between failure to state a claim, which I\nagree the simple failure to state a claim is -- is not a\nground for lack of Federal jurisdiction, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: If you fail -- you failed to state a\nFederal claim, but you do state an Alabama claim.\nMR. ROBERTS: There is no Alabama claim because\nthe only claim can arise under Federal law. So it -- so\nit is removable and then the Federal court would assert\nFederal jurisdiction, which it has over the claim and\ndismiss it.\nQUESTION: And the Federal court would dismiss,\nyes.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. But -- but\nthat was the initial question that I -- that I understood\nJustice Scalia to be asking.\nBut then he said, if it's not colorable on the\nface of the complaint, what happens then? But I don't\nthink it makes a practical difference.\nQUESTION: Well, that's my -- my hypothetical.\nIt's 3 percent and the Federal law clearly says anything\nunder 5 percent is not usurious. What happens with that\ncase?\nMR. ROBERTS: The critical -- you have to\nknow --\nQUESTION: I've given you all the facts.\nMR. ROBERTS: There still -- there still could\nbe a colorable claim under --\nQUESTION: Well, is it a colorable claim or\nisn't it when it doesn't allege a --\nMR. ROBERTS: We don't know what the rate --\nQUESTION: -- percentage rate that's usurious\nunder Federal law?\nMR. ROBERTS: You don't know what the rate is,\nYour Honor, under Federal law without -- without more\nfacts about the complaint because the National Bank Act\nprovides the -- the possibility the national bank can\ncharge any of three rates. But the --\nQUESTION: And one was a State rate.\nMR. ROBERTS: -- the fundamental -- the\nfundamental point is that -- that it's removable if\nthere's jurisdiction in the original jurisdiction of the\nFederal court.\nQUESTION:\nanswer. My -- my hypothesis is the Federal law says no\ncause of action unless it's over 5 percent. He pleads\n3 percent and he -- and he says this violates State law.\nHe says that and the defendant comes in and says, well,\nthere's no State law cause of action. It's a Federal\nclaim. I want to remove it. Does the judge remove it or\nnot?\nMR. ROBERTS: If -- if there is -- if the claim\nproperly pleaded states a claim over which there's Federal\njurisdiction, if it was pled as a claim under the National\nBank Act --\nQUESTION: No, it's -- that is a matter of State\nlaw in usury and --\nMR. ROBERTS: No.\nQUESTION: -- and you say there is no such\nanimal. But then do you get to remove it or don't you? I\ndon't understand your answer.\nQUESTION: I don't think there's authority to\nremove it, if --\nQUESTION: The answer is yes, isn't it? You can\nremove it.\nMR. ROBERTS: You can --\nQUESTION: He might be able to remove it because\nhe doesn't have confidence in what the State judge will\ndo.\nMR. ROBERTS: No -- no, Your Honor. You can\nremove it if there's -- if there's original -- would be\noriginal jurisdiction over the complaint. And that\ndoesn't matter whether it's characterized as a -- as a\ncomplaint under State law, which doesn't -- doesn't exist\nbecause it's been entirely displaced, or if it's properly\npled as a -- as a claim under Federal law. You could just\nas easily ask if they state the claim --\nQUESTION: I -- I still don't know whether\nyou're telling me yes or no to my hypothetical.\nMR. ROBERTS: I'm telling you that if the -- if\nthere's no colorable claim --\nQUESTION: Well, I've told you what the claim\nis. Is that colorable or not?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well --\nQUESTION: He says 3 percent. Federal law is\n5 percent, and Alabama says I'll -- I'll do it on\n3 percent. Can he remove it or not? He -- I would think\nhe could remove it and get it dismissed, but I'm not sure\nyou agree with that.\nQUESTION: The question -- can I ask you a\nstandard on this? I mean, I thought the standard is to\nask this question. Is this -- i.e., the State claim --\nthe kind of claim in respect to which Congress intended\nthe Federal action to be the exclusive substitute\ntherefor? If the answer to that question is yes, you can\nremove it even if it doesn't state a Federal cause of\naction. Now, have I got it right what your argument is or\nnot?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Then the answer to Justice Stevens,\nif I have the right standard, would be yes, because\nCongress did intend the Federal cause of action to be an\nexclusive substitute for those State actions which allege\nthat 3 percent is usurious.\nQUESTION: How does this removal statute read?\nI mean --\nQUESTION: Is that right or not?\nMR. ROBERTS: The -- the removal statute gives\nthe -- gives the -- the Federal courts -- gives the\ndefendant the right to remove to a Federal forum any claim\nthat arises under the laws of the United States --\nQUESTION: Arises under the law.\nMR. ROBERTS: -- and so -- so the question is\nwhether it arises under, whether there's original\njurisdiction in the Federal court.\nQUESTION: And could we please answer Justice\nBreyer's question?\nQUESTION: I want to know if I'm right or not --\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- because I'm not asking just to\nhear my standard. I'm asking --\nMR. ROBERTS: I'm -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nYes.\nQUESTION: I'm right, okay, in your opinion.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, you're right.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: Okay, and by the same token, if\nJustice Stevens' question had been asked about a subject\nthat is not under the banking act or labor management\nreporting or that part of ERISA which has been held to be\ncomplete preemption, I take it your answer would be that\nif a -- a claim was pleaded that omitted one element of\nthe Federal cause of action in the State court, and you\ndidn't start with the assumption that there was complete\npreemption for extraneous reasons, it wouldn't be\nremovable.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. If there -- if I understand\nthe hypothetical, it's not a situation where it arises\nunder the exclusive cause of action for usury under the\nNational Bank Act.\nQUESTION: Right. We don't start with the\nassumption of complete preemption. What he states is, in\nfact, a Federal claim but for one element. Is that\nremovable?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes.\nQUESTION: He leaves out an element.\nMR. ROBERTS: The Federal -- the Federal claim\nwould be removable to -- to Federal court, yes.\nQUESTION: But it's not a Federal claim. He's\nleft out one element. Would that be removable?\nQUESTION: Answer yes or no, and then sit down.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. Yes, Your Honor, it's\nremoval.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Roberts.\nMr. Clark, we'll hear from --\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN M. CLARK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. CLARK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nFederal jurisdiction is necessarily limited\njurisdiction. Federal removal jurisdiction is limited by\nstatute to those cases that arise under the Constitution\nor laws of the United States. Plaintiffs have brought no\ncause of action on the face of the complaint that arises\nunder the -- the Constitution or laws of the United\nStates. As such, there's no Federal jurisdiction under\nlong-held jurisdiction --\nQUESTION:\ninterest charged by a national bank.\nMR. CLARK: It is a --\nQUESTION: So under the theory of the\nGovernment, that is a Federal claim.\nMR. CLARK: Under the theory of the Government,\nit -- the claim, as pled, is under Alabama Code section\n8-8-1. And any interposition of Federal law at all is\nnecessarily interposed by the defendant in this case. And\nunder this Court's decisions in Gully, which was a\nNational Bank Act case, Caterpillar, MetLife, Franchise\nTax Board, the imposition of a Federal defense does not\ncreate --\nQUESTION: This is not a Federal defense, Mr. --\nMr. Clark. This is like -- suppose you have a case in\nState court and the plaintiff says, we're both from the\nState of Alabama. Defendant removes it, says, I was\nfrom -- I am, was from Georgia. Now, doesn't the\ndefendant have a right to remove that case even though\nplaintiff pled it as though it were a case that could be\nonly in State court? Said we're both from --\nMR. CLARK: Are you talking about where the --\nwhere the -- a -- a complaint is pled by -- by an -- by a\nGeorgia plaintiff against an Alabama corporation, it will\nbe removed because --\nQUESTION:\nMR. CLARK: -- because there's diversity?\nQUESTION: Plaintiff says defendant is from\nAlabama.\nMR. CLARK: Right.\nQUESTION: Defendant removes because defendant\nis, in fact, from Georgia.\nMR. CLARK: Right. Well, in that case you have\na -- you have a -- you have factual inaccuracy in the\npleading. In this case, we're not talking about their\nbasis for removal is not some factual inaccuracy of the\npleading, it's that they're saying that your legal theory,\nplaintiff, which you, under the well-pleaded complaint\nrule are allowed to choose your own legal theories, you've\ndecided to travel on the Alabama statute --\nQUESTION: You're not allowed to choose a theory\nthat doesn't exist.\nMR. CLARK: Well --\nQUESTION: The notion is that there simply is no\nclaim under State law for usury against a national bank.\nIt doesn't exist. No such claim. If the plaintiff chose\nto stand on such a claim, it would have to be dismissed\nbecause the only exclusive claim for relief -- although it\ncan be brought in State or Federal court, the exclusive\nclaim is one under Federal law. That's the argument here.\nMR. CLARK:\nthat there's no claim is -- is misstating. There is a\nclaim.\nWhat -- what Your Honor is discussing is the\nprinciple of ordinary preemption. Whether or not that\nAlabama State law claim may proceed is a question of\nordinary preemption as to be -- to be distinguished from\ncomplete preemption. And the Court held in -- in\nCaterpillar that -- that a case may not be removed on a\nFederal defense, including the defense of preemption, even\nif the defense is anticipated by both parties.\nQUESTION: Of course. And there's one case -- I\nwas surprised you didn't cite it in your brief. It's\nvery -- makes that point very nicely. The Rivet case\nagainst Regions Bank, which was featured on the other\nside -- you didn't mention it at all in your brief.\nMR. CLARK: That's an ordinary -- ordinary\npreemption case -- case also.\nQUESTION: That -- that distinguishes between a\nclaim for relief and a defense. And that case involved a\ndefense.\nMR. CLARK: Right, and --\nQUESTION: The defense of preclusion.\nMR. CLARK: Right, and that's exactly what they\nhave in this case, a mere defense in this case. And --\nQUESTION: Because?\nQUESTION: Do you -- do you disagree that\nsection 86 of the National Bank Act provides the sole\nsource of the cause of action?\nMR. CLARK: It does not provide the sole source\nof the cause of action that the plaintiffs have pled in\nthis case, and that's the difference here is -- is the\nsource of sort of organic law as to where the -- where the\ncomplaint comes from.\nAssume there were -- the defendants never\nbrought up this -- this claim or this defense of Federal\npreemption. The Alabama case would -- the Alabama usury\nclaim would go forward under Alabama law and would be\ndecided under Alabama law. So it's important to -- to see\nthe distinction between -- between what's being -- what's\nbeing pled and a defense to what's being pled.\nNow, as -- as was stated --\nQUESTION: Wait. Don't leave that point because\nyou're -- you win if you're right on that. I mean, you\nwin if your particular claim is not preempted by this\nFederal statute, you win -- and they admit it -- if this\nparticular Federal statute is not intended by Congress to\nbe the exclusive vehicle for bringing the kind of claim\nthat you have brought. So now, explain to me. You just\nsaid it isn't. Why isn't it?\nMR. CLARK:\nisn't -- why isn't the -- the cause of action we've\nbrought --\nQUESTION: Why, in your opinion, is the State\ncause of action that you brought -- you say it is not true\nthat Congress intended the Federal cause of action as the\nexclusive vehicle, excluding your kind of claim.\nMR. CLARK: Well --\nQUESTION: They say it did. You say it didn't.\nNow, all I want to hear is your arguments for\nsaying it didn't because they pointed to a lot of Federal\ncases going back to 1886 which say usury claims are to be\nbrought under the Federal statute. The State power in\nrespect to a national bank has no power. Okay? Now, your\nreply to that is what?\nMR. CLARK: As this Court stated in the\nCaterpillar case under note 4, the question of the breadth\nof the --\nQUESTION: I don't see what Caterpillar could\npossibly have to do with it since it isn't a bank case.\nMR. CLARK: Well, but the question of the\nbreadth --\nQUESTION: Is it?\nMR. CLARK: -- of the remedy provided --\nQUESTION: I'm not asking you that. I asked you\nto tell me about banking law.\nMR. CLARK: Right.\nQUESTION: I want to know is it the case in your\nview -- you concede it. You seem to contest it. I'll\nrepeat it for the third time.\nIs it the case that this Federal cause of action\nis intended by Congress as the exclusive vehicle excluding\nyour State cause of action under the Supremacy Clause of\nthe Constitution?\nMR. CLARK: Under Supremacy Clause --\nQUESTION: Is the answer to my question yes or\nno?\nMR. CLARK: That is -- yes, that is what those\ncases hold. However --\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, then --\nMR. CLARK: -- however --\nQUESTION: -- then you can't make the argument\nyou just made.\nMR. CLARK: However, the question of whether or\nnot a claim is preempted ordinarily is a -- a wholly\ndifferent question from whether or not there's\njurisdiction in the Federal courts.\nQUESTION: All right. You -- you really want --\nyou conceded you have no State claim. It's preempted by\nthe Federal statutes. Is that right? Is that what you're\nconceding?\nMR. CLARK: We -- it appears that there is no --\nthere is no State claim on the usury.\nQUESTION: All right. There is no State claim.\nSo then the question in this case is even though you\nconcede, as I take it you have -- I don't know if you\nreally mean to.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But -- but I take it you just did\nconcede that the Federal cause of action is the only\npossible cause of action that your client could have.\nMR. CLARK: Well, if the -- if my client -- if\nwe decided to travel under the Federal cause of action --\nand what this goes back to is the well-pleaded complaint\nrule. Plaintiffs in -- in cases are allowed to choose\ntheir remedies. And in this case the plaintiffs chose a\nremedy under the Alabama usury statute, be --\nQUESTION: The problem with it is your complaint\nisn't well-pleaded if the only source of law is Federal,\nwhich you conceded on your brief and again here. There is\nno well-pleaded Alabama claim because the Alabama claim or\nthe State law claim doesn't exist. The only claim that\nexists against a national bank for usury is a Federal\nclaim.\nMR. CLARK: Well, and again, that is a\ndefense -- the claim -- as the Court said in MetLife, the\ntouchstone is not whether or not preemption is obvious,\nbut the question is whether or not that creates removal\njurisdiction.\nQUESTION: No, but the -- the --\nMR. CLARK: And that has to appear from the face\nof the complaint.\nQUESTION: But I --\nQUESTION: But the face of a well-pleaded\ncomplaint. And there's a difference between preemption as\na defense to a claim that is well pleaded and here where\nyou have badly pleaded a complaint that can arise only\nunder Federal law that simply can't arise under State law.\nMR. CLARK: The problem with that test is it's\nnot a -- it's not a test. It adds another layer of -- of\nlitigation to -- to almost any claim. And what you're\ngoing to have is, instead of following a well-pleaded\ncomplaint rule that for years has served this Court,\nyou're going to have all manner of State law causes of\naction all of the sudden removed and then you're going to\nhave this litigation over -- over, well, does it state a\ncognizable cause of action under -- under State law or is\nit part of --\nQUESTION: We have one simple question. Has\nCongress provided for exclusive Federal law to govern this\nclaim? That's not a complicated question.\nMR. CLARK: Congress has not provided for\nexclusive Federal cause of action to govern an Alabama\nusury claim.\nQUESTION: So then you are not conceding --\nQUESTION: Then you just withdrew your\nconcession.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- complete preemption as opposed to\nordinary preemption.\nMR. CLARK: As a matter of ordinary preemption,\nand maybe --\nQUESTION: You're conceding ordinary preemption,\nbut not complete preemption.\nMR. CLARK: Exactly. And if I -- if I\nmisunderstood the question, then I misunderstood the\nquestion.\nQUESTION: I'm sorry. It probably was --\nMR. CLARK: As a matter of ordinary preemption,\nit may very well be that -- that --\nQUESTION: Congress --\nMR. CLARK: -- the State Law claim and\nCongress -- and Congress intended that.\nQUESTION: Let him finish answering the question\nthat somebody else asked.\nQUESTION: Oh, I'm sorry.\nMR. CLARK: But as a matter of complete\npreemption, under -- under what I was saying in the\nMetLife and the Caterpillar case, those do not\njurisdiction make. In the Gully -- Gully case itself, it\nsaid a suit brought upon a State statute dues not arise\nunder an act of Congress because prohibited thereby.\nThat is exactly the situation that we have here.\nWe have a State law cause of action. We have the\ndefendant interposing a defense saying, your State law\ncause of action is prohibited by that -- by that -- by the\nFederal act, and now we want to create removal\njurisdiction because of that.\nIt's interesting. This Court has always\nfound --\nQUESTION: Mr. Clark, I'm -- can we go back\nto -- you just cited Gully and maybe I have it wrong, but\nI thought that that was a suit to collect a State tax\nunder State law.\nMR. CLARK: Yes.\nQUESTION: That the source of law that was\napplied to the private actor was State law, the State tax.\nMR. CLARK: Yes.\nQUESTION: And here, the source of law that\nwould be applied is Federal law, not State law.\nMR. CLARK:\ncomplaint is Alabama State law. Now, the fact that it may\nbe ordinary -- ordinarily preempted is something that --\nthat the defendants can raise and the State courts can\ndecide. And the State courts have often -- often decided\nmatters of Federal preemption.\nQUESTION: I just --\nQUESTION: May I ask -- may I ask this one\nquestion? It seems to me there's a slight difference in\nthe text of section 85 and 86. And section 85 reads as a\ndefense, and if that's all there were here, I would\nunderstand your argument completely.\nBut I think one can read section 86 as creating\nan affirmative Federal cause of action, and one can argue\nthat that's the only cause of action that can be\nprosecuted. Now, if that's true, would there not be --\nwould it not -- not -- would you not have to say then that\nthe affirmative remedy in -- under the Federal statute is\nexclusive?\nMR. CLARK: Well, in -- in -- there are many\nFederal statutes that would run concurrently with State\nregulation of -- of business. And if -- if the question\nis, is the fact that there's a Federal remedy provided, in\naddition to the State remedy -- does that provide --\nprovide removal jurisdiction, the answer would be -- would\nbe no to that question.\nQUESTION: It's not only that there's a Federal\nremedy provided, but it's been construed to be the\nexclusive remedy.\nMR. CLARK: Right.\nQUESTION: That those are the only remedies that\none can get.\nMR. CLARK: But again, I would --\nQUESTION: Doesn't that distinguish it from some\nof these other hypothetical cases?\nMR. CLARK: Well, again, I would go back to this\nCourt's concept of federalism wherein the -- the State\ncourts are allowed to make that call. And in Avco, which\nestablished the -- this platypus of -- of field preemption\nor complete preemption is very limited to -- to those\nactions construing the collective -- collective bargaining\nagreements. And then it was reluctantly extended by this\nCourt in the Metropolitan Life and Taylor cases, and --\nQUESTION: Well, the argument of the Government\nis that this is another one of those rare cases. That's\ntheir whole point.\nMR. CLARK: But if this --\nQUESTION: And if it is, then you're just wrong\nabout it being only a defensive maneuver.\nMR. CLARK: This -- if this is another case, it\nis a wholly separate and -- and distinguished -- distinct\nway to go because the National Bank Act carries with it\nnone of the indicia of the intent of Congress to\ncompletely preempt that the LMRA does.\nQUESTION: But it's been interpreted by a number\nof cases to have precisely that effect.\nMR. CLARK: To have ordinary preemptive effect,\nwhich --\nQUESTION: No. No. That was not the\ninterpretation. You want us to overrule earlier cases\nabout --\nMR. CLARK: Absolutely not.\nQUESTION: -- the meaning of the National Bank\nAct?\nMR. CLARK: No.\nBut in the -- in the LMRA context, you have\nspecific jurisdictional grant to the district courts of\nthe United States. Then when ERISA came along, with\nTaylor you have -- you have specific legislative history\nsaying that this is to be interpreted under the Avco rule,\nwhich is to -- which is to -- to have a body of Federal\nlaw deciding all cases, no matter where brought, under --\nunder ERISA or deciding all cases under collective\nbargaining.\nIn this case, there's no -- in National Bank\nAct, there's no -- there is no body of Federal law that\ncould ever arise, and it's because the nature of the\nNational Bank Act is really more of a hierarchy of State\nlaws. It says, National Bank Act, you can -- you can\ncharge either the interest rate in the State in which the\nclaim is brought, you can charge the interest rate in the\nState in which the bank is located, or you can charge --\nand there's a default Federal interest rate. So what\nyou're going to have here is sort of a patchwork of State\nlaw decisions concerning the State -- State law of\nDelaware versus Alabama versus Kentucky versus Michigan.\nQUESTION: I'm still trying to get back to my --\nI'm beginning to see what I think your answer is, but\nplease don't agree with me if you really disagree.\nAll right. First, if I were to ask the\nquestion, is there Federal law in the area? Yes. Ask the\nquestion, does Federal law preempt State law? Yes.\nMR. CLARK: Ordinarily.\nQUESTION: Yes, here. Yes, well, you'll say\nright here, but wait.\nSo you -- if I ask this question, is this\nState -- Federal cause of action -- did Congress intend it\nto preempt a State cause of action substituting the\nFederal cause of action therefor? I think now you're\nprepared to say the answer to this question is yes.\nMR. CLARK: Ordinarily preempt.\nQUESTION: But you will answer the following\nquestion no. Is there an intent here by Congress that\nthis Federal cause of action that preempts the State cause\nof action by substituting an exclusive Federal remedy --\nis there an intent of Congress to allow removal when it's\npleaded? The answer is we have no evidence of that.\nMR. CLARK: The answer to that question is no.\nQUESTION: And what they're saying on their\nside -- and now this is exactly the issue between them and\nthe lower courts. And indeed, there's language that's\nunclear in the lower cases -- is that we need evidence of\nthat latter point. That's what you're saying. And\nthey're saying no.\nMR. CLARK: Well --\nQUESTION: They're saying, look, all you have to\nhave are the first three things I mentioned. Stop after\nyou decide that Congress has created a Federal action with\nthe intent that it provide an exclusive substitute for\nthis State action. Stop there. Don't ask for any further\nevidence of anything. One, because you'll never get it.\nCongress never thinks of this sort of esoteric issue. And\nsecond, because there's just no reason.\nNow, okay. Now I get the -- the clash, and now\nI can get the answer.\nMR. CLARK:\nyour question before.\nQUESTION: No, no. It's my fault. I didn't get\nit.\nMR. CLARK: And in fact, in the -- in Justice\nBrennan's concurring opinion in the MetLife/Taylor case,\nhe said, you know, that -- that congressional intent is\nthe touchstone here, and that this Court would be well\nserved not to infer removal jurisdiction unless there is\nsome clear evidence of congressional intent to do so like\nin an ERISA case or like in the LMRA case.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clark, I should perhaps have\nasked this question of the other side, but they're not\ngoing to have a lot of time left when they get back up.\nI assume that it -- it is a given that merely\nsetting forth all of the elements of a Federal cause of\naction in a complaint is not enough to provoke removal.\nThat is to say, if there is both a Federal cause of action\nand a State cause of action which has the same elements,\nif you plead those elements, which would constitute a\nFederal cause of action, but you protest that you are not\nasserting a Federal cause of action, you are only\nasserting a State cause of action, that would not be\nremovable. Would it?\nMR. CLARK: No, it would not be. And that --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nabout a -- a distinctive rule here that where you set\nforth the elements of a -- of a cause of action that you\ndo not assert to be a Federal cause of action, we are\ngoing to allow it to be removed nonetheless. Right?\nMR. CLARK: If -- if what the defendants are\narguing, it would be a new rule. And it -- it is a\ndeparture from --\nQUESTION: But may I understand this further\npoint? What Justice Scalia's described seems to me quite\ncommon. You have State human rights laws. You have\nFederal human rights laws. The same facts that I was\ndiscriminated against. If I make my choice that I want to\nbring it under, say, New York law rather than Title VII,\nthat's my prerogative. And the defendant certainly can't\nremove that case by saying, well, you could have pleaded\nthose same facts as a Title VII case. Quite different.\nThat's where there's concurrent lawmaking authority, both\nState and Federal.\nHere the argument is there is no State lawmaking\nauthority. There is no parallel source of law, State and\nFederal, and that's what makes it different from the\nordinary case where you plead the facts and they would\nstate a claim under either State law or Federal law. The\npleader has her choice.\nMR. CLARK:\nlawmaking authority. However, because of the Supremacy\nClause, the courts have held that -- that there is\nordinary preemption in this case. But that does not\nanswer the question whether or not should -- there should\nbe removal jurisdiction in the case.\nAnd it's -- in other words, the Alabama\nlegislature certainly has the right to make -- make law\nregulating Federal banks. In fact, this Court decided way\nback in 1870 that national banks are subject to State law\nregulation. And in fact, the quote from the case\nsomething like in their daily activities, they're\nregulated much more under --\nQUESTION: But not usury. I mean, you -- it's a\nquestion of how you characterize this, but I think you\nagree that on the question of usury, the Federal\nlegislation is conclusive and it was done, indeed, for the\nvery purpose of having national banks escape from whatever\njealous, mean legislation the State might pass.\nSo the only law -- I mean, the choice would be\nif you want to say, yes, I want to stick with Alabama law,\nno Federal 85, 86 for me, that case must get dismissed.\nYou can't get past the door because there is no such\nclaim.\nMR. CLARK: If -- if the preemption, ordinary\npreemption, is -- is applied, it -- it would -- applied as\nit has been, it would be dismissed.\nHowever, that is a wholly separate question from\nwhether the case arises under Federal jurisdiction. It is\na question of ordinary preemption that the State courts --\nQUESTION: Why would a plaintiff want to bring\nus a suit that inevitably must be dismissed?\nMR. CLARK: Well, and -- plaintiffs have\ndifferent reasons for pleading the things they do. Under\nthe well-pleaded complaint rule, of course, it's their\nprerogative to rise and fall on the causes of action that\nthey choose to plead.\nHowever, I go back to the MetLife case which the\nCourt said it's not the obviousness of preemption defense\nbut the intent of Congress. And I think in answer to the\nquestion over there, is why -- why go that extra step?\nWell, because this Court has decided in MetLife that that\nextra step is necessary to stop this slippery slope down\nwhere every case that is removed out of a State court, you\nnow have this other layer of -- of litigation over, well,\nis there another cause of action and -- and perhaps that\nwe have to find some -- we have to litigate over whether\nit's an exclusive cause of action.\nAnd the answer to that is this Court has\nprovided, for right or for wrong, since 1887 that we\nfollow the well-pleaded complaint rule and it follows the\nlanguage in the -- at the end of the Gully opinion saying\nthat what you need is a clear bright line limitation. And\nonly where we find some clear congressional intent, such\nas in the LMRA situation, such as in the ERISA situation,\ndo we make this extreme and extraordinary grant of field\npreemption or complete preemption or whole preemption.\nIf there are no further questions, I will sit\ndown.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Clark.\nMr. Waxman, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, the answer to your\nquestion is yes, if there are --\nQUESTION: What was my question?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: Your question was if -- if you --\nyou said this would take time, and it will. You pleaded\nall the elements of a Federal cause of action, but it\nalso -- it also satisfies a State cause of action. If the\nFederal cause of action is not exclusive except in that\nrare instance, it is not removable.\nJustice Breyer, yes, indeed we say that you stop\nat point 3. That is, you determine whether or not this is\nthe rare instance in which there's not only substantive\npreemption but exclusive Federal remedies. And the reason\nyou stop is because we have Federal question jurisdiction.\nIt says that removal is tied to original jurisdiction,\nand therefore, the question is, does the complaint\nwell-pleaded necessarily state a cause of action? Justice\nHolmes indicated in a statement that is oft repeated and,\nif it's anything, is under-inclusive, as this Court\nindicated I think in Merrell Dow, that a suit arises under\nthe law that creates the cause of action. If the cause of\naction is exclusively Federal, in that rare instance, it's\nunder arising-under jurisdiction.\nJustice Kennedy I think asked what for me is the\nmost difficult question in this Court's sometimes not\nfully explicated arising-under jurisdiction, which is the\nquestion that was addressed in Merrell Dow and in\nparticular in footnote 1 in this Court's opinion in\nMerrell Dow, which is if you have a State cause of action\nmisrepresentation, but it has embedded with it as a\nnecessary matter a conclusion about whether Federal law\nwas or was not satisfied, does that State claim arise\nunder Federal jurisdiction?\nIn Franchise Tax Board, this Court repeated\ndicta that suggests that the answer is yes. And in Smith\nversus Kansas City Title and Trust, this -- this Court\nseemed to indicate yes.\nthe Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, the Court suggested that\nthe embedded Federal question has to be central to the\nState cause of action and really important.\nAnd the result, as I -- as I think things stand\nnow, is we have a very long footnote 1 in this Court's\nopinion in Merrell Dow that says many people have\ndifficulty resolving our jurisprudence in this area, but\nin the Merrell Dow context, where there was a State tort\nclaim that could -- may I finish my --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Waxman.\n"
