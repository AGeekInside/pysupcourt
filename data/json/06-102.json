        "content": "(10:16 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst today in case 06-102, Sinochem International\nversus Malaysia International Shipping Corporation.\nMr. Castanias.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. CASTANIAS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CASTANIAS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThis Court in Ruhrgas against Marathon\nencapsulated the relevant line of this Court's\nprecedents in the rule that we suggest controls in this\ncase. What it said, it is hardly novel for a Federal\ncourt to choose among threshold grounds denying audience\nto a case on the merits. Now this Court's cases\nextending through Steel Company and Ruhrgas and\nafterward, hold true to this statement. Threshold\nnon-merits issues may be decided by a Federal court\nbefore it determines its jurisdiction, in that term\nmeant as subject matter and personal jurisdiction.\nThis Court in this case should hold the\nforum non conveniens is another one of those threshold\nnon-merits grounds for denying audience to a case that\ncan be considered first before jurisdiction.\nAdopting that rule in this case will do\nthree things. First, it will result in a rule that is\nmost faithful to the Court's precedents in the area.\nSecond, it will respect the rule of Steel\nCompany and forbid ultra vires judgments on the merits.\nThere is no chance that a dismissal in forum non\nconveniens will exercise more power than is granted to\nthe Federal courts by Article III or by Congress in\nstatutes.\nAnd finally, it will give the Federal courts\nthe appropriate flexibility in appropriate cases to\nserve important interests such as economy,\nconstitutional avoidance, and particularly relevant in\nthis case, international comity.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just on the second point.\nI wanted -- does the rule of the Federal\ndistrict court in forum non conveniens where it\ndismisses a case for lack of a convenient form, does it\nhave any ongoing consequences as the law of the case? I\nknow our Chick Kam Choo precedent where we said Federal\ncourt determination forum non conveniens is not binding\nin a state court, but supposing in this case that the\nparties went to San Francisco with a -- and said we want\nto sue there. Would the San Francisco court, the United\nStates District Court feel bound by the determination\nthat this dispute is determined by Chinese law, and that\nthe Chinese court is therefore the appropriate court?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, I think there are two\ncomponents to your question, Justice Kennedy, and let me\nsee if I can answer both of them. The first is whether\nthe determination that the Federal court in\nPhiladelphia, for example, in this case, was an\ninconvenient forum. Would that determination be binding\non the court in San Francisco? Our view would be\nprobably not. It would be persuasive in that case, but\nthe forum non conveniens --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the ruling that\nthis would be governed by Chinese law and that the\nChinese court is the best forum to consider that? That\ntoo has no lat -- has no effect beyond the court in\nPhiladelphia?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Let me -- that was the\nsecond part of your question that I was going to try to\nanswer. And with regard to that, I think that it would\nnot have preclusive effect in the main -- in the mine\nrun of cases. And the reason I think it wouldn't have\npreclusive effect is that it would be one factor in what\nthis Court has described as a multifarious analysis\nunder the forum non conveniens analysis at American\nDredging, and so it would be hard to say that for issue\npreclusion, for example, that the choice of law\ndetermination in that case was necessary to the ruling\ndismissing the case.\nNow one might imagine a case at the margins\nwhere that was the case and there might be a case for\npreclusive effect, but that's, I think, not likely to be\npresented by this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know any case,\nMr. Castanias, where there has been a forum non\nconveniens dismissal in favor of a foreign forum where\nthe plaintiff has then attempted to go into a different\nU.S. court to get a different resolution?\nMR. CASTANIAS: And by U.S. court you mean\nFederal court like Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, or\nperhaps a state court as well?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Either one.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, I think I have seen\ncases, and I can't cite them to you as I stand here\nright now, where litigants have tried to go to a state\ncourt. Another Federal Court, I can't think of a single\none. I'm hard pressed to.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you were urging\nthat this is a threshold issue and it has nothing to do\nwith the merits; but there is an argument that the\nexistence of personal jurisdiction or not might have\nsome bearing on the forum non conveniens evaluation.\nMR. CASTANIAS: In some cases, I suppose\nthat could be true, Justice Ginsburg; but the point of\nour rule is that the only issue presented by this case\nis that of Federal court power. There may be a case\nwhere it is appropriate in the district court's\ndiscretion. In fact in Ruhrgas, you writing for the\nCourt pointed out that the normal court order business\nis to determine subject matter jurisdiction first and\nthen personal jurisdiction.\nBut the point of our application of that\nrule in this case is there may be some cases where it's\nappropriate, and this is a paradigmatic example of the\nsort of case where it would be appropriate to decide the\nforum non conveniens issue first, before personal\njurisdiction. I hope that satisfies -- I hope that's an\nanswer to your question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.\nMR. CASTANIAS: With regard to the body of\nthis Court's decisions, we cited in our briefs cases\nlike Leroy against Great Western, which holds that a\nFederal court can decide venue before deciding personal\njurisdiction.\nIn this case it's hardly different because\nagain, as American Dredging pointed out, forum non\nconveniens is properly described as a supervening venue\nprovision. The Gold Law case which we cite in our reply\nbrief, and the solicitor general relies on, says that\nFederal courts have the power to transfer a case before\ndetermining personal jurisdiction. And grants even more\nanalogous here are the extension in the Tenet case. In\nthe case of extension, extension documents have very\nsimilar, though different, moorings as the forum non\nconveniens doctrine. And they're both discretionary\ndecisions to decline to exercise jurisdiction.\nThis Court pointed out, citing the Ellis\ncase, and it pointed this out in the Steel Company,\nRuhrgas and Tenet cases that extension can be decided\nfirst. And again, applying that precedent to the case\nof forum non conveniens, it's -- it really does follow\nthat forum non conveniens can be decided first.\nWith regard to the Tenet case, that case is\nvery close to a merits issue, perhaps even one might\ncall it a merits issue, but it was so threshold that it\nwas appropriate to decide the totten bar that was at\nissue in that case before jurisdiction.\nAgain, and with all of these lines of cases,\ndeciding forum non conveniens first will have -- will\nprovide no chance of the Federal court going beyond its\nconstitutionally and statutorily exercised powers.\nNow, I'd like to leave the Court with one\nfinal thought about the way this, and the importance of\napplying this rule in this case.\nThe complaint that Malaysia International\nShipping makes against Sinochem is nothing more than a\nclaim that Sinochem defrauded a Chinese court. There is\na term used in the complaint, a fraudulent\nmisrepresentation. The term negligent misrepresentation\nis also used. But make no mistake about it. The\ncomplaint in this case is that Sinochem made a\nmisrepresentation to Chinese courts. This is precisely\nthe sort of interference with the Chinese court system\nwhich has proceeded to judgment, and judgment by the way\non these issues in favor of Sinochem and against\nMalaysia International, that really cries out for the\nflexibility inherent in our rule.\nUnless the Court has further questions, I'll\nreserve the balance of my time.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One question that doesn't\neven have to do with the issue before us. I'm curious\nabout why we're speaking of fora, judicial fora, there\nwas in this picture an agreement to arbitrate. What\nhappened to that?\nMR. CASTANIAS: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the\nlast part of your question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was an agreement to\narbitrate. And we're talking about a suit brought by\none party in the United States, by the other party in\nChina, and no arbitration occurred apparently, although\nI thought the contract called for it.\nMR. CASTANIAS: My understanding,\nJustice Ginsburg, and this is a vague recollection from\none aspect of the record, is that the arbitration clause\nwas held not to apply in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not an\nexercise of law declaring authority on the merits?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Oh, I'm sorry. To be clear,\nMr. Chief Justice, it was not held by the district court\nin this case to not apply. That issue was not in front\nof it. But at the time --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, the\ndistrict court didn't hold that it didn't apply?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Yes, correct. I think, I\nthink that, I think it was agreed by the parties or\nunderstood by the Chinese court. My memory on this with\nregard to the record, maybe background facts that are\nnot in the record but I, on summing it up, are a little\nbe fuzzy. But I think to answer your question,\nMr. Chief Justice, there, in abstention, an -- an\narbitration clause I think provides a closer question\nthan this case does for an issue of whether it's law\ndeclaring authority, I think as your question put it.\nIt's arguable that an arbitration clause is\nlittle more than a, in essence, a forum selection clause\nof the same kind that a venue provision or a forum non\nconveniens ruling might provide.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It might have been the\nallegedly defrauded Chinese court that found that the\narbitration clause did not apply?\nMR. CASTANIAS: I'm sorry. The first part\nof your question I had trouble --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It might have been the\nallegedly defrauded Chinese court which found that the\narbitration clause did not apply.\nMR. CASTANIAS: That -- it may be. I just,\nI don't have that ruling in front of me.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see how that court\nwould have gotten into the act unless that was the case.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Again, we'll reserve the\nremainder of our time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Hallward-Driemeier?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING PETITIONER\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn Steel Company the Court held that it is\nimpermissible to adjudicate the merits of a case over\nwhich the Court may lack jurisdiction. But it is\nanother thing entirely for the Court to decline to\nexercise jurisdiction that it might well possess. In\nRuhrgas clarified, in language that counsel has already\nquoted, that a court may choose among threshold grounds\nfor denying audience to a case on the merits.\nNow, the dividing line between a threshold\nnon-merits ground and a merits ground may in some cases\nbe difficult. And the Court has -- members of the Court\nhave disagreed in some cases; but there is an easier set\nof cases and that is where the Court is declining to\nexercise jurisdiction and especially where as here, it\nis doing so in favor of litigation of the substantive\ndispute in another forum.\nAnd this Court has -- has decided already\nthat it is permissible, for example, for a court to\ndecline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction before\ndeciding a difficult question of whether it would\npossess subject matter jurisdiction over the\nsupplemental claims at all.\nForum non conveniens is in the nature of an\nabstention extension doctrine. In Gulf Oil, one of the\nfirst cases of this Court to describe the forum non\nconveniens doctrine and its factors, analogizes forum\nnon conveniens to a Burford abstention. The Court even\nin Steel Company acknowledged that abstention on grounds\nof Younger, for example, would be permissible to decide\nbefore resolving a disputed question of jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Gulf Oil case\ndoes say that a forum non conveniens dismissal\npresupposes that the forum is one in which there's\npersonal jurisdiction and one of proper venue. It's\njust another forum is more appropriate.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's, that's\nright, Your Honor. And the Court said so in the course\nof rejecting an argument that because it was conceded\nthat jurisdiction and venue were proper in the Southern\nDistrict of New York, that the doctrine of forum non\nconveniens could not apply.\nThe Court said that couldn't be so, because\nthe doctrine of forum non conveniens presupposes the\navailability of two fora. But the Court did not address\nthe entirely separate question of whether the Court\ncould assume that even I it had jurisdiction, it would\nnot exercise it. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was not, not\nfelicitously put. I think all the Court was saying was\nthat there would no need for a doctrine of forum non\nconveniens where there is no personal jurisdiction.\nThe only point of the doctrine is to get rid\nof the case where you -- where you do have jurisdiction.\nAnd so you do not have to -- but that\ndoesn't mean that you must establish jurisdiction before\nyou can exercise the doctrine. It is a doctrine that\noverrides the existence of personal jurisdiction. In\nthat sense, it presupposes personal jurisdiction.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That -- that's\nright, Your Honor. And in the court already determined\nit lacked subject matter jurisdiction or if venue was\nimproper, then forum non conveniens would have no work\nto do. But Gulf Oil certainly didn't address this\nquestion of the ordering of these restful matters. And\nof course the doctrine of forum non conveniens, its\nentire purpose is to allow litigation to occur in a more\nconvenient and appropriate forum, and it would undermine\nseverely the purposes of the doctrine --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do I correctly understand\nyour argument to be that, that in this case it happened\nto be the doubt about personal jurisdiction rather than\nsubject matter jurisdiction but you would make the same\nargument if it were a doubt about subject matter\njurisdiction?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right, we\nwould. And, and one of the cases that Ruhrgas quoted\nand relies on was the D.C. Circuit's decision in --\nPapandreou, which involved subject matter jurisdiction\nunder the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. And there\nthe Court quite rightly said that it would be improper\nto force a foreign sovereign to undergo extensive\njurisdictional discovery in this case when it was clear\nthat at the end of the day the Court would dismiss day\nin favor of a foreign forum in any event. So it would\napply to, to questions of subject matter jurisdiction as\nwell as personal --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can a district court\ndo both? Can it say I've reached personal jurisdiction,\nI conclude that I, we do not have jurisdiction over this\ncase? And in the alternative be dismissed on forum non\nconveniens grounds if it turns out we do?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I think they could\ndo both. The second would be really superfluous.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But not if there's,\nI presume, if there's an appeal.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: If -- if -- an\nappeal, the court could, the court of appeals could\naffirm on either ground.\nAgain, to emphasize the point that counsel\nhas made, the argument here is not that forum non\nconveniens must necessarily be decided before\njurisdictional questions. In fact, the natural order\nwould be to decide jurisdictional issues first.\nBut as the Court held in the analogous\ncircumstance of venue in the Leroy decision, there are\ncircumstances that counsel in favor of reversing that\norder, such as avoiding a difficult constitutional issue\nor, as in Mr. Papandreou, avoiding imposing the burden\nof jurisdictional discovery on a foreign sovereign or\nforeign entity when a case going to be dismissed in the\nend in any event.\nIf the Court has no further questions --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In Martin, in the\nhypothetical where this case is dismissed for forum non\nconveniens and then they go to another Federal district\ncourt, could the second Federal district court say this\nhas already been heard by the first district court; I'm\nnot getting into it? Or, or does that district court\nhave, have to go through the motion again?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I think the\nsecond court would have to at the very least ascertain\nthat circumstances had not changed or that there weren't\nrelevant difference of facts. Your, your hypothetical\nearlier was of filing, refiling this suit in California.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, why is that? Now --\nto some extent this is a call for the district judge.\nThere is a degree of discretion involved in it, and it's\nentirely conceivable that one district judge would\ncorrectly dismiss the case for forum non conveniens\nwhereas another district judge faced with the same\nquestion would not do so. And both of them would be\nacting lawfully; isn't that -- isn't that conceivable?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It is in the nature\nof a discretionary determination, as Your Honor says,\nthat -- that different judges could reach different\ndecisions. In the Parsons case, Parsons versus\nChesapeake and Ohio Railway, the Court emphasized there\nthe question was whether a state court's forum non\nconveniens determination had preclusive effect on a\nFederal court's analysis of the factors. And this Court\nheld that did it not. In large part because it's\nimpossible to know that every factor would be the same\nor would be weighed the same by the second court.\nAnd so I think it would be open to the\nsecond court to, to reanalyze the issues; but even if it\nweren't, even if there were some preclusive effects, I\ndon't think that that undermines our position, because\nit is, of course, equally true of other threshold\ndeterminations such as personal and subject matter\njurisdiction that they may have issue-preclusive effects\nin subsequent litigations.\nFor example, a trial court could decide that\nit lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the amount\nin controversy is insufficient because under state law,\nthe plaintiff would not be able to recover punitive\ndamage. That determination would be given\nissue-preclusive effect in a subsequent suit filed by\nthe same plaintiff in another district court. In fact\nJustice Scalia wrote an opinion on that subject in the\nD.C. Circuit in the Dozier versus Ford Motor Company.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hallward-Driemeier,\nbecause your time is running out, there is a question\nabout a court without personal jurisdiction dismissing\non forum non conveniens ground, and that is, it's\ncommon, as you know, to condition forum non conveniens\ndismissals on the defendant's undertaking that the\ndefendant will not raise the statute of limitations and\nother conditions. If the Court has no personal\njurisdiction over the defendant, it would be unable to\nimpose such conditions; isn't that so?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Our understanding\nof a conditional dismissal in this circumstance is that\nthe dismissing court is explaining its understanding of\nthe world, and that -- and facts as they bear upon its\nanalysis, such as is the defendant subject to\njurisdiction in a foreign forum. Oftentimes, the\nplaintiff -- if I could answer -- oftentime the\nplaintiff objects to dismissal because they can't sue\nthe defendant in the foreign forum. The defendant\nagrees to waive any objection to jurisdiction. That\nunderstanding of fact is a condition of the dismissal.\nIf it later proves to be untrue because the defendant\nobjects to jurisdiction of the foreign court, it would\nbe open to the plaintiff to seek to reopen the first\nsuit on that ground.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMs. Higgins.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN-MICHELE G. HIGGINS,\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMS. HIGGINS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nWe believe that this Court should affirm the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit\nbased on three reasons.\nWe believe that personal jurisdiction is a\nrequirement articulated in Gulf Oil versus Gilbert which\nremains before this judicially created doctrine may be\nevaluated.\nSecond, we believe that adopting the Third\nCircuit holding establishes a clear, bright line\ndiscrete rule that is easy to enforce and appropriate to\nevaluate at any other appellate level.\nAnd third, we argue that the nature of the\ndoctrine of forum non conveniens itself presupposes\njurisdiction before making a ruling to dismiss for some\nother convenient forum.\nThe analysis that has brought the case to\nthis Court has included a divergence of opinions between\nvarious circuit courts. In the briefing, all parties\ntend to agree that forum non conveniens is a\nnon-merits-based ground for evaluating a ruling. The\nFifth Circuit has decided otherwise. We, we express\nsome issue with the fact that in looking at a forum non\nconveniens analysis, the Court necessarily, as the\nGovernment has conceded in its brief, takes a peek at\nthe merits of the dispute.\nThe other issue that arises is that if a\ncourt dismisses a case based on forum non conveniens,\nand then an appeal is sought, the appellate court always\nhas the opportunity to evaluate both the subject matter\njurisdiction and the personal jurisdiction.\nThe Seventh Circuit in the Intek versus\nEngle case, came up with such a ruling recently. They\nexpressed support for the Second Circuit and the D.C.\nCircuit, saying that it is appropriate to be able to\ndeal with non-threshold matters such as forum non\nconveniens without ascertaining jurisdiction. In fact,\nthe court acknowledged that they thought the dicta\nexpressed in the Ruhrgas opinion would become the\nholding of this Court.\nHowever, for judicial efficiency, it decided\nto go through the analysis to determine whether or not\nthere was personal jurisdiction in the case. It went\nthrough subject matter of the case and personal\njurisdiction, and it determined that there was no\njurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that only proved that\nan appellate court can affirm on grounds other than the\nground relied upon by the district court, even if the\nground relied upon by the district court is also a valid\nground. It's up to an appellate court -- - it's\navailable to an appellate court, especially where the\nground is jurisdiction, to choose to look into\njurisdiction and say there isn't any. I don't know, I\ndon't know how that adds to your case.\nMS. HIGGINS: Justice Scalia, I think it's\nappropriate. Both parties cite the vast waste of\njudicial resources that would occur if forum non\nconveniens had to establish personal jurisdiction first.\nAnd frankly, we see that as the other way. The Insight\ncase in our opinion --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you found one\nappellate court that chose to do it that way. Frankly,\nif I were sitting on an appellate panel I wouldn't do it\nthat way if I thought the forum non conveniens ground\nwas valid.\nMS. HIGGINS: Well, I tend to agree with you\non that point as well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMS. HIGGINS: -- with it. But I think what\nthe Third Circuit was stressing in its opinion is that\nyou cannot subject the parties to litigate in another\nforum if there is some chance that your own forum does\nnot have the personal jurisdiction. It is a\nprerequisite of the doctrine itself.\nAnd we believe that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question.\nWe talk of course about the unnecessary burden on the\nlitigants, but I wonder if there isn't even a more\nfundamental problem with the procedure that the Third\nCircuit followed here. That is, is there really a case\nor controversy down there? Does the defendant have any\nmotivation to spend a lot of money fighting about\njurisdiction when he knows that the case is going to be\ntransferred anyway? Is this a real live controversy on\nthe issue that's left open?\nMS. HIGGINS: I think it is,\nJustice Stevens, and I think the Court would address\nthat by saying certainly on the negligent\nmisrepresentation claim at this stage the record\nindicates that there was a ruling in China, but the\nappellate window is still open. And certainly the\nevidence has long gone into the Chinese case. Those are\ncompletely separate issues.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There couldn't be any\nquestion about the alternate forum taking jurisdiction\nhere, because it, in fact, had. A proceeding was\nongoing in China. So you brought up the question about\nthe Court gives up -- if the Court dismisses on forum\nnon conveniens and then the supposedly more convenient\nforum doesn't take the case. But that can't be a factor\nin this case, where the other forum was in China and was\nindeed litigating the case.\nMS. HIGGINS: Yes, Justice Ginsburg; but as\npractical matter, with the resolution of this case by\nthis Court we would certainly have to start the process,\nwhatever ruling this Court finds, all over again. We\ncertainly cannot participate in the action in China\nbecause that has already gone on. We would have the\noption to participate in the case in the United States\nbecause those specific issues were not litigated in\nChina.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm sorry. I'm not\nfollowing you, so please straighten me out. I thought\nthat the claim was that a fraud had been committed on\nthe Chinese court.\nMS. HIGGINS: That is correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Your claim was that a\nfraud had been committed on the Chinese court in\nconnection with the arrest of this vessel and the\nensuing proceedings?\nMS. HIGGINS: That is correct,\nJustice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, why in the world\nshould a court in the United States get involved in\ndetermining whether a fraud was committed on a Chinese\ncourt?\nMS. HIGGINS: Justice Ginsburg, we believe\nit was appropriate for U.S. review because of the\nbalancing of the maritime commerce that occurred in the\ncase because of the bills of ladings. Although the\ndistrict court believed that Chinese law would apply to\nthe contract for the sale of the steel coils, in fact we\nwould make the argument that with the various charter\nparties in the case, including the bill of lading that\nyou reference, indeed American law would apply and there\nwould be some different issues that would be evaluated.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: American law to determine\nwhether a fraud had been committed on the Chinese court?\nIt seems just stating it that it might be offensive to\nthe Chinese court to have another court determine\nwhether it had been defrauded.\nMS. HIGGINS: That would have been a\nconcern, Justice Ginsburg, except that issue was brought\nup expressly before the Chinese court; and if I may\nrefer you to page 18 of the joint appendix, the Chinese\ncourt ruled that, quote, \"Given that the People's\nRepublic of China and the U.S. are different\nsovereignties with different jurisdictions, whether the\nappellant has taken actions at any U.S. court in respect\nof this case will have no effect on the exercise by a\nChinese court of its competent jurisdiction over said\ncase.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that was a very\npolite way of the Chinese court saying: We don't care\nwhat the United States court is doing; we've got this\ncase, we've got the ship, and we're going to adjudicate\nit; and it doesn't matter. We don't have to say\nanything to the United States to chastise it for even\nthinking it could become involved in this matter. It\nwas polite.\nMS. HIGGINS: And I agree with you, Your\nHonor, except it is the only indication in the record\nthat there is some foreign nation that has expressed an\nopinion on this. If you read the brief by the Solicitor\nGeneral, the Government would have us think that every\nsingle case is going to involve foreign nations and\ndelicate foreign policy disputes and such other factors.\nVery clearly, there is no such evidence in\nthe record and the only evidence we do have is from\nanother sovereign, China, that says if you have a U.S.\ncause of action we have no problem if a U.S. court\nadjudicates it on the merits.\nHaving said that, the issue here was whether\nor not personal jurisdiction should have been decided\nbefore the forum non conveniens. And again, we would\njust go back to our second point, where the court\nbelieves that it can't evaluate a doctrine without\nhaving -- if it's a required factor of the doctrine that\na sitting court making a ruling on that issue has to\npresuppose personal jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why -- I mean, I\nassume that in deciding forum non conveniens -- that\nthere is an inconvenient forum, the court making that\njudgment would assume that there was personal\njurisdiction and would simply say, you know, put that\ninto the mix. Assuming we have personal jurisdiction,\nis this nonetheless an inconvenient forum? And if the\ncourt can say yes, that's the end of the game.\nI don't see what you have to gain here.\nSuppose the Court does decide that it has jurisdiction\nand dismisses for forum non conveniens? What, what --\nwhat are you gambling for here? I don't understand\nwhat's the -- what's the desirable outcome you hope to\nachieve?\nMS. HIGGINS: Well, for Malaysia\nInternational the desirable outcome would be upholding\nthe Third Circuit opinion. It then gets remanded to the\ndistrict court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right, and the district\ncourt at best for you, at best, finds personal\njurisdiction. If it finds no personal jurisdiction, you\nknow, it dismisses for that reason instead of for forum\nnon conveniens. If it finds personal jurisdiction, it\nwould say: Oh, there is personal jurisdiction; but I\nassumed there was personal jurisdiction when I dismissed\nit for forum non conveniens, so this is really the same\ncall that I made before. Dismissed for forum non\nconveniens.\nMS. HIGGINS: And Justice Scalia, I concede\nthat, but you would also have the ability of the\ndefendant to waive personal jurisdiction. Again, you\nget into the judicial resources. The defendant could\nchoose to waive it at that point in time and then I am\nright back again --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would a defendant\nthat has moved to dismiss for forum non conveniens waive\njurisdiction? It seems to me that there is something in\nthis picture that is to your advantage and that is if\nyou can get the Court to say, well, we have to do\npersonal jurisdiction first, you ask for discovery on\nthat issue and it goes out on forum non conveniens\nwithout deciding personal jurisdiction, you are not\ngoing to get that discovery.\nMS. HIGGINS: That is correct, Your Honor,\nand then I would have to look for an evaluation of forum\nnon conveniens that was favorable to the client. That\nwas one of the issues that we raised on appeal to the\nThird Circuit; and the court did not make a ruling on\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but discovery for its\nown sake is no fun. What does discovery for its own\nsake achieve?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unless there's something at\nthe end of the discovery. Now, maybe what you hoped is\nthat the Republic of China would not accede to the\ndiscovery and therefore, you would get a default\njudgment or something. You know, I just -- I just don't\nsee what's at the end of this game for you.\nMS. HIGGINS: That's one possibility. But\nagain, we talked about the policy issues of why the\nGovernment came in with the position they did. They\nsuggested that the United States had a very distinct\ninterest in avoiding delay, burdensome discovery, and\ndifficult legal issues; and frankly, my thought is the\nsame as yours. Any party has those desires to avoid\nthose issues and come to a ruling in their favor.\nIn this case we would hope that with an\nadoption of personal jurisdiction first, then the court\nwould be required to rule on our motion to reevaluate\nforum non conveniens and we might be able to convince\nthe court to be able to pursuit the case here. In this\nparticular case, that is the goal that we seek because\nthat is, as you say, all we have to do at the end of the\ngame with it.\nI also wanted to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess we should ask the\nother side, but I think I know what their answer will\nbe, whether if the Court does dismiss on the basis of\nforum non conveniens without first addressing personal\njurisdiction, it must assume the existence of personal\njurisdiction? And what do you think?\nMS. HIGGINS: I think it has to, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I agree.\nMS. HIGGINS: The Seventh Circuit case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I agree. So how are you\ngoing to get a different result then when it goes back\nand the court of appeals says, oh, yes, you had personal\njurisdiction, just as you thought you did, whereupon the\ndistrict court says, oh, yeah, same result.\nMS. HIGGINS: But there is the possibility\nof a case happening, as it happened in the In Re\nBridgestone case, which was a Seventh Circuit case. In\nthat case the court dismissed for forum non conveniens\nand the -- I believe it dealt with the country of\nMexico. The parties had obtained a ruling in Mexico\nsaying that the Mexican courts were not to take\njurisdiction of the case. Under those circumstances the\ncourt was required to take back the case because it no\nlonger had the alternate forum in which to adjudicate\nthe dispute. So I think that's the one example of the\ncase that you raise.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we know that that's\nnot going to happen here, because the Chinese court has\nadjudicated the case.\nMS. HIGGINS: Not on this issue, Your Honor,\nand actually not on the bills of lading issue. You did\nraise that point and there is still the potential of\narbitration taking place under the various charter\nparties to adjudicate the rights and liabilities of the\nremaining parties in the action. So that matter is\nstill open as well.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We're dealing with,\nbecause it's a foreign nation, not the codified forum\nnon conveniens that's in 1404 and 1406. And you are\ntreating this as it were counterpart to 1404, which is\nforum non conveniens. But 1406 is wrong venue and, as\nyou know, in the Goldlaw case this Court said a court\ncan transfer even though it lacks personal jurisdiction\nand is a place of improper venue.\nNow, why isn't the forum non conveniens\ndoctrine as applied to foreign nations a combination of\n1404 and a 1406, and if it includes 1406 then you don't\nneed your personal jurisdiction, you don't need venue,\nyou just transfer it to a place where those conditions\nexist?\nMS. HIGGINS: I think, Your Honor, in that\ncase, it's -- as the doctrine developed, the difference\nlies in the statutory framework of the 1404 versus the\njudicially created version of the forum non conveniens.\nI think you're correct that as forum non\nconveniens exists today, side by side with 1404, you\ncertainly have the limited application that it will\napply to only foreign nations or to a State court. And\nthat's what I thought was the benefit of creating a rule\nthat's rather limited in scope, that will not touch many\nother factors. It can be discrete. It can be applied\neasily. And that comports with Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure 1. We thought that was one of the reasons why\na finding by this Court would be able to ease the\nadministration of cases along those lines.\nIf the Court has no other questions, I\ncertainly would urge that, based on precedent and logic\nand the terms of the doctrine of forum non conveniens\nitself, that the ruling of the Third Circuit be upheld.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Higgins.\nMr. Castanias, you have 9 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. CASTANIAS\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. CASTANIAS: Mr. Chief Justice, unless\nthe Court has further questions, we'll rest on the\nargument given in the briefs.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
