        "content": "(1:00 p.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument this afternoon in Case 09-152, Bruesewitz v.\nWyeth.\nMr. Frederick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThis case involves a vaccine designed in the\n1940s that was administered to Hannah Bruesewitz in\n1992, some 30 years after scientists discovered a safer\nway to design the pertussis component of the DTP\nvaccine. The Third Circuit held that the Bruesewitzes\ncould not pursue a design defect claim under State law\ninvoking the preemption principle in claiming that the\nVaccine Act of 1986 preempted the Bruesewitz's State\nclaim. That holding is in error for three reasons.\nFirst, the court overlooked the numerous\nprovisions of the Act protecting manufacturers from\nliability, but it did not expressly preempt design\ndefect claims.\nSecond, the court misconstrued the word\n\"unavoidable\" in section 22(b)(1)'s Federal law defense.\nAnd third, the court adopted a policy that\nexposes children to unnecessary safety risks.\nWith respect to the first reason, in the\n1986 Act Congress created a program, the vaccine\nprogram, that was funded by surcharges on the vaccines\nthat users used, and out of that fund designed a program\nto pay compensation to persons who were injured by\nvaccine-related acts.\nCongress also provided a mechanism for\nexhaustion through the vaccine court program before a\nperson claiming injury could pursue a State law cause of\naction. In creating Federal law defenses to the State\nlaw that was designed to govern such actions, Congress\nestablished certain defenses, but all of those defenses\napply on a case-by-case basis. There are no absolute\nprovisions that preclude a State law claim. The Third\nCircuit misunderstood that basic principle.\nThe defenses that the Vaccine Act created\nfor manufacturers includes such things as a regulatory\ncompliance defense for failure to warrant claims, a\nlearned intermediary doctrine that is instituted at a\nnational level, the imposition of comment k -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is -- I'm\nsorry, Mr. Frederick. What's the point that you are\ntrying to make? That because there are a whole bunch of\nprovisions designed to help manufacturers, that this one\ncan't possibly also be designed to help manufacturers?\nMR. FREDERICK: My point is that when one\nlooks at the specific language of 22(b)(1) against the\nbackdrop of these other provisions, it's clear what\nCongress was intending was to enact a national defense,\nbut not to displace State law completely. And the\nquestion presented is whether, on a case-by-case basis,\nthe design defect claims that had been brought by the\nBruesewitzes are displaced as a matter of law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought\nthe argument would go the other way: That because they\nset up a compensation scheme, that was a good sign that\nthey didn't want to allow State law claims.\nMR. FREDERICK: And if one looks,\nMr. Chief Justice, at sections 21, 22, and 23 of the\nAct, what 21 provides is that the Claimant can elect not\nto accept the vaccine court judgment. Section 22\nprovides the standards of responsibility, and section 23\nprovides the mechanisms for trial of the State law\nclaim. And 23(e) provides that the evidence of the\nvaccine table and what happens in the vaccine court\nshall not be admissible in the State law claim.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Section 22(b)(1) refers to\nside effects that were unavoidable even though the\nvaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by\nproper directions and warnings.\nIf the term \"unavoidable\" was intended to\ncarry its ordinary meaning, what need was there for the\nrest of that language: \"Even though the vaccine was\nproperly prepared and was accompanied by proper\ndirections and warnings\"? If it was improperly prepared\nor didn't have the proper directions and warnings, then\nthe side effects are avoidable. So that language is\nsurplus, isn't it, if \"unavoidable\" really means\nunavoidable?\nMR. FREDERICK: What Congress was intending\nto do, Justice Alito, was, with the word \"unavoidable,\"\nto use a word that had a settled meaning in the common\nlaw. And that settled meaning referred to the design of\nthe product in light of the current state of scientific\nknowledge. That grew directly from comment k, the\nsection 402A of the restatement of torts.\nAnd in comment k, which tracked the\nstructure of the restatement provision itself, the\ngeneral rule for the restatement was strict liability\nfor dangerous products, quote, \"although the drug is\nproperly manufactured or properly warned against.\"\nJUSTICE ALITO: But isn't it true that at\nthe time, there was a distinct minority view that you\ncould not recover for design defects for vaccines?\nMR. FREDERICK: There certainly was a\ndebate. The majority view, however, was to adopt\ncomment k as a defense to strict liability claims on a\ncase-by-case basis. And the cases that we've set forth,\nI think, illustrate that, even the cases that the other\nside cites. Several of them had been overruled by the\ntime the 1986 act took effect and there was a decided\nshift in favor in the case-by-case application of\ncomment k. And in the 1987 report, Congress made very\nclear it intended to preserve that case-by-case\napproach. That is set forth at page 50 of our brief,\nJustice Alito.\nSo when one looks at both the words that\nCongress used in 22(b)(1), the debates that occurred,\nand the committee reports that explained what Congress\nis intending here, we believe the intent is unmistakably\nclear to adopt comment k as a defense to -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you haven't really\nanswered Justice Alito's question as to why the later\nlanguage is not surplus. If indeed it bears the\ntechnical meaning you say that it -- that it bears, that\nlater language is surplus.\nMR. FREDERICK: It is not surplus if one\nreads comment k and understands what the drafters there\nwere intending to get at, which was: If, based on\ncurrent scientific knowledge, the risks are unavoidably\nunsafe, meaning there is no way in science we can design\na safer product, there will be a defense to a claim of\nstrict liability unless or provided that the product is\nproperly manufactured and warned against. This was a\nproviso that was intended to ensure that the focus be\nkept on the unavoidable, unsafe aspects of the design of\nthe vaccine.\nNow, the other side's view takes other words\nof 22(b)(1) and renders them surplusage. And I am\nlooking now at page 19A of our reply brief, where we set\nforth the statutory language, if you want to follow\nalong here. What the other side's view is that after\nthe word \"if\" following the date of October 1, 1988 -- I\nam at page 19A of the reply brief, the addendum.\nUnder their view, all of the words that\nfollow the word \"if\" and through \"even though\" becomes\nsurplusage, because under their reading the manufacturer\nis relieved of all liability if, quote, \"the vaccine was\nproperly prepared and was accompanied by proper\ndirections and warnings,\" and renders the entire concept\nof unavoidability surplusage. So our view is that what\nthese -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Say that again. I don't\nfollow it. Tell me that again.\nMR. FREDERICK: Under their --\nJustice Scalia, looking at (b)(1) on page 19A following\nthe date October 1, 1988.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. FREDERICK: Under their view, after the\nword \"if,\" the phrase \"the injury or death resulted from\nside effects that were unavoidable even though\" is\nsurplusage, because in their view of the statute\nCongress created a complete exoneration from liability\nif the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied\nby proper warnings. They took the concept of\nunavoidability completely out of the statute.\nAnd the word \"unavoidable\" had a settled\nmeaning. There were numerous cases that had construed\nthat meaning in light of the 20-year history of\nRestatement section 402A. So -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I take it that the\ngovernment is urging that \"unavoidable\" means\nunavoidable in the vaccine that has gained FDA approval.\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, that\nposition is incorrect. And there is empirical evidence\nindicating that the manufacturers, Lederle's Mr.\nJohnson, testified that the problem with the '86 version\nof the statute was that it allowed for design defects to\ngo forward. And he urged there to be a regulatory\ncompliance defense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are asking us\nto interpret this statute in light of his testimony at a\nhearing?\nMR. FREDERICK: What I'm saying is that\nCongress had choices, and one of the choices was to\nadopt a regulatory compliance defense for design defect\nclaims, and it chose not to do that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me the\nlanguage supports the reading Justice Ginsburg has just\nsuggested, or the government has just suggested, with\nthe use of the word \"the.\" It says the effects of the\nvaccine were unavoidable, even though the vaccine was\nproperly prepared. Your position is, well -- the\nquestion is whether it was unavoidable if you could have\nprepared a different vaccine. But this says\n\"unavoidable, even though the vaccine.\"\nMR. FREDERICK: Right. And it is preceded\nby the word \"if,\" Mr. Chief Justice. And if -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't see the word\n\"if.\"\nMR. FREDERICK: It's right after the date,\n1988. If the injury resulted from side effects.\nSo it is looking on a case-by-case basis in\nthat context, whether the vaccine created the injury or\nside effect that is being complained of.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Frederick, I have this\nproblem with -- with your interpretation. As -- as has\nbeen said, the government interprets \"unavoidable\" to\nmean unavoidable with respect to the vaccine that has\nbeen approved.\nIf it doesn't mean that, if it simply means\nunavoidable with some other vaccine, you could always\navoid them if you have a vaccine that is significantly\nless effective. I mean, what other vaccine are you\ncomparing it with?\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, let me try\nto clear this up in this way. All of these vaccines are\napproved by the FDA. And the question is whether you\ngive a presumption of design correctness for all time\nbased on the FDA's approval of that vaccine. This\nvaccine was approved in -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, but the\nplaintiff comes in and says, Look, you could have\neliminated this, this, and this, and these side effects\nwould not occur. Of course the vaccine would only be\neffective in 75% of the cases, but nonetheless, it was\navoidable.\nMR. FREDERICK: And that's why the concept\nof unavoidability as a defense always rested on the\ncurrent State of scientific knowledge. In the 1960s,\nLederle signed -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that doesn't answer\nmy question. I acknowledge it rests on current\nscientific knowledge, but current scientific knowledge\nwould enable you to design a drug that does not have\nthese side effects even though it's significantly less\neffective, and there is no criterion as to how much less\neffective it has to be to qualify and so forth, whereas\nthe government's interpretation of the word ties it to\na -- to a particular vaccine.\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, the way\nthese cases were construed, and we have cited them in\nour reply brief, the standard was whether or not it was\nas safe as a feasible alternative but was -- sorry, as\nefficacious but safer as a feasible alternative. That's\nhow the courts -- the State court -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be just as\neffective?\nMR. FREDERICK: It has to be efficacious.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just as effective?\nMR. FREDERICK: Sure. I will concede that\npoint.\nThe problem here was that an efficacious\ndesign existed as of the 1960s and the internal\ndocuments indicated that Lederle -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You keep saying that.\nBut didn't I understand correctly that that drug was\nwithdrawn from the Japanese market in which it had\noriginally been -\nMR. FREDERICK: No. Let me clarify.\nThere are two theories by which there was a\ndesign defect claim. One concerned a product by Eli\nLilly called Tri-Solgen. That was a split cell vaccine\nthat was developed and sold in the 1960s. It was\ndemonstrated to have far less serious effects for\nencephalopathy and other residual seizure disorders and\nproblems.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Was it proven that it\nwas as effective?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, it was, and it had 65%\nof the market.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And could it be used for\nall five -- there are five inoculations in this series.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And only one of them was\nnot approved for the first three.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's the second one for\nJustice Sotomayor. This was an acellular technique that\nhad been studied in the United States in the 1950s and\neventually was developed by the Japanese in the 1980s.\nThat acellular technique was eventually approved by the\nFDA in the mid-1990s and is now common in all of the\nthree-part VDAP vaccines that are currently on the\nmarket.\nOur point is that the scientists literally\nknew about that acellular technique. They were\nbeginning to do tests, but they didn't aggressively do\nit for economic reasons. And that has never been -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If there is a safer\nalternative, it must be pursued regardless of cost?\nMR. FREDERICK: No, there is a\nreasonableness standard. The standard of due care that\nState law and tort has always had is: What does a\nreasonable manufacturer do in the same or similar\ncircumstances? But that is a question, ultimately, of\nfact, whether or not the economics -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In a question of fact in a\ncase-by-case determination in every State, the\nmanufacturers would probably be worse off under your\napproach than if they didn't have the law at all,\nbecause the law seems to at least qualify section -\ncomment k.\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Kennedy, that was\nthe whole design of the vaccine program, because if you\nchannelled most claims into something that the\nmanufacturers didn't have to defend against or pay the\njudgments of, the thought was that the vast, vast\nmajority of people would never go to State court. And\nit would only be in those rare circumstances like the\nproblem we have here where the vaccine court awards\nnothing that the Bruesewitzes even had to go to State\ncourt.\nHad they filed their claim a month earlier\nwhen residual seizure disorder was still on the vaccine\ntable, we wouldn't be here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why was it taken off?\nMR. FREDERICK: There was a debate in the\nscientific community. The Institute of Medicine\nbelieved that residual seizure disorder was medically\nproved to be a causative factor from the pertussis\ncomponent of the DTP. There was a disagreement of -- by\nfolks in the Secretary of Health and Human Services as\nto whether or not that was sufficient to justify legal\ncause.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And so didn't the special\nmaster find what -- in the compensation proceeding that\ncausation had not been proved?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. And it was a\nproceeding, Justice Ginsburg, that had allowed for no\ndiscovery against the drug manufacturer.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you -- you say that\nin court you could prove causation, since you had\ndiscovery, although you couldn't prove it before the\nspecial master because discovery was very limited?\nMR. FREDERICK: That's our submission. And\nthat was the design that Congress intended. That's why\nwhat happens in the vaccine court under section 23(e),\nas a matter of law, is inadmissible in a subsequent\nState court action.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And can you -- maybe this\nis a good point, but I would like to know what your\nresponse is. I'm not asking you in either a hostile nor\nfriendly way.\nThe -- assume for the moment that the\nlanguage, I cannot find clear one way or the other. So\nI think it's ambiguous. At that point, what is your\nresponse, on that assumption that this brief on the\nother side from the American Academy of Pediatrics and\n21 other physician and public health organizations -\nwhat the pediatricians here say is that, if you win,\nwe're turning this over to judges and juries instead of\nthe FDA and other specialized agencies, that the result\ncould well be driving certain vaccines from the market,\nand basically, a lot of children will die. And that -\nthat's their claim.\nAnd I think that their legal argument there\nis that wasn't Congress's purpose. Congress's purpose\nwas the contrary.\nSo leaving the language out of it, I would\nlike you to respond to what I would call that\npurpose-related, fact-related argument by these\nparticular people.\nMR. FREDERICK: If I may, let me make two\npoints, Justice Breyer, the legal point and the policy\npoint.\nThe legal point is: This Court's cases make\nclear that there is a clear statement principle. Before\nCongress is presumed to have displaced State law, it\nmust act with a clear statement. And that is true in\nthe Eleventh Amendment context as well as the preemption\ncontext. So if you conclude there is ambiguity, we\nshould win -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, there is another case\non that where we are going to have to go into -- which\nis, does that mean every bit of it has to be clear?\nDoes it mean the intent has to be clear? That's a\ncomplicated area. But I will put that aside for the\nmoment.\nMR. FREDERICK: Here, 22(a) answers that\nquestion as a matter of law, because it says the State\nlaw provides the general rule.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. I've got -\nMR. FREDERICK: Now, that's the legal point.\nThe policy point is that by channelling the vast\nmajority -- and the SG's brief says 99 percent of the\npeople who go through vaccine court accept the judgment\nof the vaccine court.\nAnd on the First Circuit, the Schaefer\ndecision -- which you wrote, Justice Breyer -- said that\neven in the instances in which people lose in the\nvaccine court, they may regard the hurdles and obstacles\nof the State court process to be so great that they\ndon't bother to try. It's difficult to win these kinds\nof cases in State court.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Explain why.\nMR. FREDERICK: Because proving causation\nand proving the availability, based on science, of an\nalternative design is not something that is a relatively\neasy thing to do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's -- that's why I\nasked the question. Frankly, if I see the Academy of\nPediatrics telling me one thing, and I in an earlier\ncase wrote the other thing, I do tend to think I could\nhave been wrong.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's -- that's why I\nam asking you: Is that the best you can find on the\nother side, namely something I once wrote in a case? Or\nare there other -- are there other things?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREDERICK: It happened in the moment to\ncome to mind, Justice Breyer.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREDERICK: The point that I want to\nmake is that the threat of liability is only a realistic\none if there is a threat that there's actually going to\nbe payment at the end. And Plaintiffs do not bring\ncases to lose; they bring cases if they have a\nreasonable prospect of winning based on what the\nevidence would show a design defect to be.\nAnd so when Congress set up this system and\nit exonerated the vaccine makers of 99 percent of all\ncases that are going to go through this system claiming\ndefects or problems, if you ask manufacturers around the\ncountry that you get a special defense against punitive\ndamages, you get a regulatory compliance defense for\nfailure to warn, you have to have a trifurcated\nproceeding, and you are not going to have to pay damages\nor defend the actions 99 percent of the time, most\nmanufacturers in the United States would take that\nbargain.\nAnd so the question -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would depend, I\nsuppose, on what they thought the judgments were going\nto be in the 1 percent of the time.\nMR. FREDERICK: And -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't take too\nmany $60 million verdicts to make you come out on the\nother side of your calculus.\nMR. FREDERICK: And that's why, going back\nto the wording of the statute, Mr. Chief Justice, in\nsection 23, where Congress said for someone who had\nelected not to accept the judgment in 21, you get to go\nto State court and try to prove your claim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Anyone could go to the\nState -- I mean, somebody who won in the vaccine court\ncould go to court on the argument that the amount was\ninsufficient, the amount of compensation.\nThere is -- there is no foreclosure of\nanyone to come to court; is that right?\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct. But you\nhave to fight through the defenses that Congress erected\nin 22(b)(1), (b)(2), and (c), which are quite difficult\ndefenses.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What would happen if a drug\nmanufacturer sought FDA approval of an alternative\nvaccine and the injury occurred during the period while\nthat was under consideration by the FDA? That's -\nthat's just too bad?\nMR. FREDERICK: A harder case, but not one\nthat couldn't be proved under State law. The negligence\ninquiry would look into whether or not a reasonable\nmanufacturer would have tried earlier and more\naggressively to obtain FDA approval.\nHere, we think we can meet that standard,\nbecause we had a drug that was on the market, the split\ncells Tri-Solgen, that was proved to be safer and just\nas efficacious, and it had been on the market until\nWyeth took it off, after Wyeth concluded that when it\npurchased the rights from Eli Lilly it couldn't\nmanufacture the vaccine Tri-Solgen in a way that it\nwould get it the profit stream that it wanted.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In the -- when it was -\nwhen Tri-Solgen was owned by Lilly and you said that it\nwas approved and marketed, was that one available for\nall five inoculations?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg.\nThat was used for all through the series for children's\nvaccination for DTP.\nAnd the problem here with the other side's\napproach, fundamentally, is that not only does it render\npart of 22(b)(1) surplusage, and not only does it ignore\nthe many benefits that manufacturers got, but at the end\nof the day it allows for an exoneration from liability,\neven for manufacturers who know there is a safer design\navailable.\nAnd that fundamentally is something Congress\nnever would have imagined, that manufacturers would\ninvoke an immunity from suit, even when they knew -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the secretary -- does\nthe secretary have the authority to -- to withdraw\ncertification on the ground that it is no longer safe,\nfair, and potent?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, Justice Kennedy. There\nis -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You are assuming that the\nmanufacturer knows something that the secretary doesn't?\nMR. FREDERICK: No. Our submission,\nJustice Kennedy, is that for many vaccines there is no\nsafer alternative, and there could be no design defect\nclaim. But for those instances in which there is a\nsafer alternative, the burden under State law is for the\nmanufacturer to act reasonably in pursuing the safer\ndesign, if that is available.\nIt's not -- there is no provision in the FDA\nregulations or under statute for the FDA to engage in a\ncomparative safety analysis.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the language -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any provision\nin the regulations that require a manufacturer to\nwithdraw a drug earlier than when the FDA tells them to?\nMR. FREDERICK: Not that I'm aware of.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So this immunity would\ncome along until they go to the FDA and say, Well, we've\ngotten enough incidents to prove -\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct. And this\nvery vaccine, Justice Sotomayor, was taken off the\nmarket in 1998. And the product that Wyeth used as the\nsubstitute for it says in its package insert, this is a\nsafer vaccine than the Tri-Immunol that we have taken\noff the market.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I'm not sure\nthat in most cases you are going to be able to tell\nimmediately -- you are marketing one vaccine and\nsomething else is being tested or about to be approved,\nor it's on the market -- that that's safer.\nParticularly since you have to look not only at -\nwhatever -- injury and mortality rates, but also\nefficaciousness -- or efficiency, I guess -- in terms of\nthe vaccine.\nSo you don't know right away. Somebody\ncomes in and says, Here's a different vaccine; your\nvaccine causes one death every 10,000 doses, or whatever\nit is. And the other says, This is better; it's one\ndeath every 12,000 doses. You say, Well, but ours is\nmore efficient in stopping the vaccine.\nWell, how much more efficient? Well, it\ndepends on the judgment of a jury.\nMR. FREDERICK: And the manufacturers win\nthat case, probably, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but you assume that\nthere is no clause or burden to the manufacturers who\ndefend these suits to assess settlement offers. This is\na -- this is a tremendous expense.\nMR. FREDERICK: Only if you accept the -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it may well be that\nthe manufacturer has to settle a meritorious case; we\nall know that.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. But, Justice Kennedy,\nthat's after an exhaustive process through which they\nhave gone through the vaccine program and the person is\ndissatisfied with the remedy that's provided.\nSo in these vast majority of cases, unlike\ndrug cases where there is no channeling mechanism, here\nthe vaccine fund is designed to take care of the vast,\nvast, vast majority of those kinds of claims. And it's\nonly in those rare circumstances where there would be a\nState lawsuit.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Frederick.\nMs. Sullivan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress enacted the National Childhood\nVaccine Injury Act against the backdrop of a wave of\ntort litigation that threatened to drive manufacturers\nout of the business of providing the vaccine -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why didn't they make\nthe vaccine court exclusive? There is plenty of\nadministrative systems that make -- preclude State law\nactions altogether and place you in administrative\nproceedings. So if their intent was to drive out State\nlawsuits, why not do that?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Because, Justice Sotomayor,\nthe kind of lawsuits that caused Congress concern were\nthe very kind of lawsuits that are expressly preempted\nby 22(b)(1), and that is design defect claims, which\nhave the exact problem that was just being discussed.\nFor a design defect claim, as Justice Scalia\npointed out, the challenge that is brought to the\nvaccine that was approved by the FDA can be challenged\nas less safe than some alternative vaccine, bounded only\nby the imagination of the experts. It was those design\ndefect claims that were the problem. Congress\npreserved -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how -- couldn't they\nhave taken care of that with Daubert? I mean, won't\nmost of these cases get resolved on a motion for summary\njudgment?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Not design defect claims,\nYour Honor. Just to go back to 1986 and what the crisis\nwas. As the 1986 House report makes clear, the\nmanufacturers were being driven out of the vaccine\nbusiness, imperiling the nation's design -- vaccine\nsupply by design defect claims that did survive summary\njudgment. And that did lead to the danger, as\nJustice Kennedy pointed out, of settlements. The key\npoint about protection -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Point me to the FDA\nregulations or law where the FDA, in giving a license to\nor permitting a new vaccine, actually looks at whether\nthat vaccine is the most efficacious way with the least\nserious harm to the population. Is there a regulation\nthat requires that judgment by them before they issue\npermission to market?\nMS. SULLIVAN: There is not, Justice\nSotomayor. What the FDA is empowered by regulation to\ndecide under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is whether\nthe vaccine is safe and efficacious. Once approved -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. What is the\nmotivation? If there is no -- there's no approval\nmechanism for the FDA to look at that issue, what is the\nmotivation for manufacturers to voluntarily remove a\ndrug that is causing harm to the public before the FDA\nacts?\nIf they are completely immune under your\nreading of this preemption statute, what motivates them\nto act more quickly?\nMS. SULLIVAN: The Act itself. But\nsection 27 of the Act -- let me just go back and\ndescribe what Congress did in 1986. It said, We have a\ncrisis, and it created three things to solve the crisis:\nA preemption provision that said, Let's end the design\ndefect claims that are causing the problem. Let's\nprovide --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Sullivan --\nMs. Sullivan, if Congress had wanted to do that, they\ncould have said simply that no vaccine manufacturer may\nbe held civilly liable if the vaccine is properly\nprepared and accompanied by proper directions and\nadequate warnings. That would have been the simplest\nstatement.\nCongress didn't make that statement. They\nwere asked to amend the statute to make that statement,\nand they didn't. I mean, if you wanted to make it clear\nthat there is no design defect liability, then say that:\nNo civil liability unless inadequately -- improperly\nprepared, improper directions, or warnings.\nWhat they -- the language that they used is\ncertainly, to say the least, confusing. This\nunavoidable -- these side effects that were unavoidable.\nWell, why did they need to put that in there if what\nthey were concerned with was to cut out liability for\ndesign defects?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, let's go\nback to the text and put -- read the two clauses\ntogether. And our main point here is, as Justice Alito\nand Justice Scalia have already pointed out, the\nPetitioners render the \"even though\" clause surplusage.\nWe read the two clauses together. And let's\nread them together against the backdrop of the three\nkinds of product liability claims that could be brought:\nDesign defect, manufacturing defect, and failure to\nwarn.\nThe -- the statute references two out of the\nthree. And we -- we believe that -- and the Government\nbelieves that the reason that was done was to say that\nthe third omitted kind of claim, design defect claims,\nwere preempted. The two that were allowed -- and,\nJustice Sotomayor, this is what makes it different from\nstraight pure administrative schemes -- this does\npreempt defect claims, the omitted claim. It allows\nmanufacturing defect claims and it allows warning claims\nsubject to the presumption in 22(b)(2). Limited -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under your view, when does\nthe manufacturer have to come forward and acknowledge\nthat there is a defect in the design?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Well, Justice Kennedy, the\nmanufacturer is subject to ongoing reporting\nrequirements under section 28 of the statute. And I\nthink that if you think there is ambiguity in the text,\nas Justice Breyer suggests, we can go to the structure\nof the statute. And let me just mention a number of\nfeatures of the statute -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you please just\nanswer that question? What is the motivation for the\nmanufacturer to either continue the testing of their\nproduct and voluntarily stopping it if a better design\nhas been found by someone else or even an inducement for\nthem to find a better design if a competitor comes\naround?\nBecause I don't see why they should stop\nuntil they have caused as many injuries as they need to\nbefore the FDA says stop.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Well, Justice -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is the inducement\nfor them to do it voluntarily?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Yes. First of all, Justice\nSotomayor, Justice Kennedy is correct, the FDA can order\nremoval from the market.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I am not asking about\nthe FDA.\nMS. SULLIVAN: But the reason why -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I said the\nmanufacturers' motivations.\nMS. SULLIVAN: And -- and, Justice\nSotomayor, the reason why the FDA has never had to use\nthat nuclear option is that it -- it works closely with\nmanufacturers long before it needs to be used, and\nthat's because of the rest of the structure of the Act.\nI would like to focus on what Congress did\nin 1986 in addition to -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before you get to\nthat, I think your answer to Justice Sotomayor's\nquestion is: Nothing; the manufacturers have no reason\nto take the vaccine off the market until the FDA tells\nthem to.\nMS. SULLIVAN: That's not correct, Your\nHonor. So the -- section 27. Section 27 distinguishes\nvaccines from other drugs. Section 27 says that the\nSecretary of Health and Human Services shall -- shall\nhave an affirmative mandate to promote safer vaccines\nand to reduce the number of side effects.\nAnd the Vaccine Act didn't just eliminate\ndesign defects -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if the manufacturer is\nslow or remiss or negligent or willful in not giving the\ninformation to the Government, there is nothing the\ninjured person can do. There is still complete\npreemption, under your view?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Of design defect claims,\nJustice Kennedy, but not of warning claims. And it\nwill -- there are grave consequences if a manufacturer\nwithholds knowledge of adverse effects from the FDA.\nSection 22(b)(2) --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does the victim of that\nwithholding have a private cause of action? I don't see\nanything in this that would give them -\nMS. SULLIVAN: There is not a freestanding\ncause of action. But if you look at 22(b)(2), you see\nthat the manufacturer will lose his -- lose its\npresumption that its warnings were correct. It will be\nsubject to warnings suits in State court if it withholds\ninformation from the FDA without the benefit of the\npresumption.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The warning -\nMS. SULLIVAN: And if you look at -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The warning -- the\nwarning claims, the manufacturing claims, those are\nalways avoidable.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Always avoidable. Exactly,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- so what can be -\nthe only thing that can be unavoidable is the design\ndefect.\nMS. SULLIVAN: That's exactly right, Your\nHonor. And that's how the text makes sense.\nTo go back to the text, the text says there\nare two kinds of avoidable side effects: Side effects\nthat come from improper preparation -- well, of course\nthe manufacturer can avoid those; it can prepare the\nvaccine better without contaminants -- and it can avoid\nwarning defects by changing the warning.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The warning doesn't have\nto say, \"Warning: We could make something better if we\nwanted to.\"\n(Laughter.)\nMS. SULLIVAN: It does not. That's correct,\nYour Honor. And that's because -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or there is something\nbetter on the market than this that won't cause that.\nMS. SULLIVAN: But look. Mr. Frederick has\ntold a story that perhaps has misled the Court into\nthinking there was a safer vaccine in the 1980s. There\nwas not.\nAnd just to be -- just to tell the story of\na success in the way that FDA worked with the scientific\ncommunity and the national Government worked with\nmanufacturers to produce a safer vaccine, it was the\nFederal -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, can you -- can we\nbe concrete and concentrate on this Tri-Solgen, which,\naccording to Mr. Frederick -\nMS. SULLIVAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- Eli was producing, and\nit was available for all five inoculations. And then\nWyeth bought it, and then -\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, Tri-Solgen\nwas a split cell vaccine. It was manufactured and\nproduced by Lily in the 60s and withdrawn in the 70s.\nBut Mr. Frederick was incorrect that the Government ever\ndeemed it as effective and safer than the wholesale\nvaccine, Tri-Immunol, that was administered in this\ncase.\nIf I could refer Your Honor to page 19 of\nthe Respondent's brief, we cite to 50 -- Federal\nRegister 51051 and 52. That's where the FDA\nspecifically determined that Tri-Solgen was not safer,\nwas not safer, than Tri-Immunol with respect to seizure\ndisorders or other severe effects. It simply may have\ninvolved less local effects like fevers and rashes.\nSo there was never any government\ndetermination that Tri-Solgen was safer. In fact,\nTri-Solgen came off the market. Why? Because the\nsection 27 worked, the Federal Government worked to\npromote safer vaccines.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How does it do that? Look,\nI think a difficulty I have is this. Imagine vaccine X\nsaves 10,000 lives, but inevitably 20 children will be\nkilled. That's inevitable. Time period one.\nFive years passes. The manufacturer now\nrealizes he could save three of those five people. All\nright. Is there anything in the law that requires him\nto tell the FDA that that is so?\nMS. SULLIVAN: There is not anything that\nrequires him to tell the FDA that is so.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If there is\nnothing that requires him to tell the FDA what comes\nalong, what I think your opponent is saying is at that\nmoment, it is no longer an unavoidable harm and there is\nnothing in this statute that says that unavoidable\nharms -- that avoidable harms are taken away from the\ncourts.\nSo what is your response to -- what is your\nresponse to that? He's saying all the unavoidable ones\nare taken away, but not the avoidable ones. And now we\nhave an example. So what is your response to that?\nMS. SULLIVAN: That \"unavoidable\" in the\nstatute is a term of art. And to the extent that\ncomment k is relevant at all, Mr. Frederick says, \"Oh,\nCongress was adopting comment k, the majority view.\"\nWell, first, there was not a majority view.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you want to read it\nespecially to mean unavoidable and avoidable. Let's\nassume you are right about that, or let's assume it is\nat least ambiguous. If that's so, then what is your\nresponse to the question I raised before, that is: That\nhe says that if you allow judges and juries to decide\nonly the question of avoidability, there will not be the\nharms that the childhood pediatricians thought there\nwould be, because most people will go to the courts -\nto the vaccine court anyway. There are very few such\ncases, and there will not be enough liability to drive\nmanufacturers from the market.\nYou heard him respond to that. What is your\nresponse to that?\nMS. SULLIVAN: First, there will be enough\nliability to drive manufacturers from the market. Let\nme correct some things that Mr. Frederick said that were\nnot true.\nThe vaccine court, 99 percent of those who\nreceive monetary judgments in vaccine court, the\nadministrative no fault system, do accept their award,\nbut what Congress was concerned about was those who lose\nin the administrative system and then go take their\nsecond bite at the apple in State court, whereas, as has\nbeen mentioned, they are not bound by any findings in\nthe vaccine court. 23(b) says -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's a minor point, but I\nthought if you went into the vaccine court you had to\nsign something saying you weren't going to go into a\ntort case. I'm wrong about that?\nMS. SULLIVAN: No. You go into a vaccine\ncourt and there is an exhaustion requirement. 22(b)(1)\nmust add something to the exhaustion requirement. We\nsay it adds an exemption preemption provision, but you\ncan elect at the end to take the judgement or not.\nThose who get money in vaccine court, 99 percent take\nit. What we are worried about is the 64 percent who\nlose in vaccine court.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do those 64 percent\ndo now? What is the percentage of those people who\nactually go into court now?\nMS. SULLIVAN: I can't answer that, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that because whatever\nthe percentage is, proving causation is never easy -\nMS. SULLIVAN: That's true, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- for non-listed -\nMS. SULLIVAN: But there are 5,000 claimants\nin vaccine court now who claim there is a relationship\nbetween the mumps, measles, and rubella vaccine and\nautism. They have lost all six test cases and when the\nindividual cases are resolved, that is 5,000 potential\nclaimants in State court.\nCongress was worried about episodic waves of\nfear about vaccines leading to future litigation. They\ntook care of existing Claimants with vaccine injuries\nback in 1986 with the compensation system. The reason\nthey put in 22(b)(1) was to prevent future litigation in\nState court where manufacturers could be driven from the\nmarket by the fear of liability that had in 1986\ninvolved the withdrawal of insurance, the escalation of\ninsurance costs, the withdrawal of one manufacturer from\nthe vaccine market.\nAnd today there are very few vaccine\nmanufacturers and the risk of the vaccine supply on\nwhich the nation's protection from contagious disease\ndepends, it depends upon the existence of that stable\nsupply of vaccines.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If Congress were so\nclear, as you are describing it, then why didn't it\nadopt the provision that said failure to develop a safer\nvaccine would not be grounds for liability?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg,\nI think you have to look to the rest of the structure of\nthe Acts to see what Congress did here. It did three\nthings.\nIt made vaccines quite different from other\ndrugs. And this is not a situation where the FDA has to\nmonitor 11,000 drugs, of which it wouldn't even care if\nthey came off the market. The government doesn't care\nif -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it also was directed\nto vaccines.\nMS. SULLIVAN: That's right -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The failure to develop a\nsafer vaccine would not be grounds for liability, and\nCongress didn't enact that.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Your Honor, Congress enacted\na preemption provision that we think it was in the four\ncorners of the provision of 22(b)(1), \"preempts design\ndefects.\" It has a carveout for the two kinds of suits\nthat are allowed, manufacturer and warning defects. The\nclear holding of the rest of the text is that design\ndefect claims are precluded. Compensation makes sure\nthat people who do have injuries from vaccines are taken\ncare of.\nThe rest of the structure of the Act injects\nthe Federal Government into driving the vaccine\ndevelopment process in a way that it does not for other\ndrugs. Congress wants people to take vaccines. It\nwants us to inoculate all our children. It wants us to\nhave compensation to ensure people who are injured that\nthey can get some money to take care of their children's\ndisabilities.\nBut Congress wanted to make sure that it was\ndriving, that the Federal Government, the FDA, the\nCenters For Disease Control, together with the AMA,\ntogether with task forces, were driving research to make\nsafer vaccines.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are making an\nassumption that has a flawed premise, which is that\ntheir only concern was protecting the manufacturers.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Not at all, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It couldn't have been.\nMS. SULLIVAN: They compensate the victims.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Not only do they\ncompensate victims, but they permitted victims to go\ninto State court.\nMS. SULLIVAN: For manufacturing and warning\nclaims. For manufacturing and warning claims.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. That's your\nassumption. My point is that if we are talking about\nwhat the purpose was, you can't assume that -\nMS. SULLIVAN: Two purposes: Compensation\nand the protection of the vaccine supply. Justice\nSotomayor, the clearest way that I -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what you are\nsuggesting is there is no compensation for an injury\nthat was avoidable in its normal sense, which is -\nMS. SULLIVAN: No -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If this drug had not\nbeen sold and another drug had been used the person\nwould have avoided their injury.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Well, there is no such drug\nhere. Acellular vaccine was not approved by the FDA for\nuse in infants under two until 1996. It was approved\nfor children over two in 1991. That's because in this\ncountry, we require clinical studies that weren't\nrequired in Japan a decade earlier to make sure that -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It sounds to me that\nyou're going to win on non-summary judgment. I don't\nsee -- I do understand the cost of litigation. It can\nbe very, very onerous. So I'm not trying to minimize\nit, but I do think that there's a whole lot of hurdles\nin place before a plaintiff wins on one of these claims.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Sotomayor,\nmanufacturing claims and warning claims are susceptible\nto summary judgment. Design defect claims are not in\nthe same way. You are shadowboxing against an infinite\nnumber of theories about how there could have been a\nsafer vaccine.\nBut the clearest way I can say why\nMr. Frederick's interpretation can't be right is: If\nyou concede at least one purpose was to protect\nmanufacturers, to protect the vaccine supply, in\naddition to compensating the victims, Mr. Frederick's\nreading of 22(b)(1) does not serve that purpose. He\nreads 22(b)(1) to leave manufacturers in the exact same\nplace after the Act that they were before. Go to State\ncourt. Try to show that there was -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They set up this whole\ncompensation scheme where everybody agrees -- I mean,\nthe manufacturers got this compensation scheme which\ntook most of the cases out of State court.\nSo to say they were left just like they were\nbefore, before they were exposed to all these claims -\nnow it's only to a very small part of them.\nMS. SULLIVAN: That's not quite right,\nJustice Ginsburg. The Act allows all losers in vaccine\ncourt to go to State court. There are 5,000 -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, yes. I got that\nanswer from Mr. Frederick before. But most of them\ndon't, because it's cheaper, faster, and working well.\nMS. SULLIVAN: For vaccine court winners,\nthat's true. For vaccine court losers, the fear was\nthat these lawsuits would drive manufacturers out of the\nmarket, even if the manufacturers could win in the end.\nFor a preemption provision to do any work,\nit needs to attach at the beginning of the claim.\n22(e), for example, refers to bringing an action.\n22(b)(1), to do any work to protect manufacturers, has\nto attach to prevent the cause of action from being\nbrought.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm still not clear -- I'm\nstill not clear what answer you gave to\nJustice Ginsburg's question, saying: Why didn't\nCongress put this out in plain words: There should be\nno liability for design? Is the answer sloppy drafting?\nAre you reluctant to give that answer?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Well, Justice Kennedy, it\ncould have been drafted a different way and it would\nhave meant the same thing. We think the best way to\nread the two clauses together \"unavoidable,\" \"even\nthough,\" is to refer to what comment k meant. Now,\ncomment k used the term \"unavoidable.\" We know Congress\nwas thinking about the term unavoidable. We know that\nbecause in the 1986 House report the congressional\ncommittee say we would like to enact the principle of\ncomment K.\nWell, what is the principle of comment K?\nThe principle of comment k is there are so products so\nuseful that we want them to stay on the market without\ndesign defect liability. They can only be sued for\nmanufacturing or warning defects. Those are the only\ntwo kinds of suits you can bring.\nIn our view, comment k was Congress's\ndenomination of vaccines as comment -- sorry, 22.1 was\nthe denomination of -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Sullivan.\nMS. SULLIVAN: -- as a comment k product.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Horwich.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH,\nFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. HORWICH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI think the Court finds itself actually\nthree-quarters of the way through the argument without\nactually hearing about the most important federal agency\nthat is involved with this, which is arguably not the\nFood and Drug Administration but the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention.\nAnd so with respect to the question about\nwhat is it that is governing whether the -- whether\nthe -- the - a given vaccine is subject to the Act and\nwhat are the incentives and who is actually making the\ndecision and who is trying to determine if there's\nsomething better that's out there that we should be\npursuing -- that is the mission of the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention.\nThat is why Congress took the original\ntable -- the vaccines that are on the original table in\nthis statute were taken from CDC's recommendations that\nreflect CDC's expert scientific judgment, based on the\ninput from the medical and scientific community, of what\nvaccines do we have that are the ones we should use to\nprotect the public health?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do they get the information\nfrom the manufacturers? And -- I mean, would they find\nout if in fact there had been a change -\nMR. HORWICH: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and it was now -- there\nis a safer alternative?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, let me -- let me give -\nkind of -- let me answer that in -- in two ways.\nThe -- the first is that the -- the nature\nof vaccine research is not something that manufacturers\ndo in a cloistered laboratory somewhere. So it's\nactually very unlikely to imagine that a manufacturer\nsomehow comes uniquely into possession of this\nknowledge.\nI mean in fact, the Federal Government\nspends billions of dollars doing vaccine research that\ngovernment scientists themselves perform. The\ngovernment sets the agenda for what are our targets for\ndevelopment. The -- the research agenda to pursue the\nacellular pertussis vaccine was something driven by the\nFederal Government.\nFederal Government made a choice and said\nwe -- we don't want manufacturers and our scientists\npursuing the -- the Tri-Solgen approach and trying to\nimprove that. We don't understand that vaccine very\nwell. We know the ultimate target needs to be the\ndevelopment of an acellular vaccine, and so that's the\nresearch path that -- to go on.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose then that in -\nsuppose I look into this, which I will do, the CDC and\nwhat they do. And suppose I become convinced you are\ncompletely right, that this is a government agency that\nis top of this and the chances of something going wrong\nare very small and they will figure it all out, together\nwith the manufacturers. Suppose I conclude that.\nWhat do I do about this word unavoidable?\nMR. HORWICH: Well I think -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now I can't say that the\nword unavoidable -- it's pretty hard to say that that\nword unavoidable means avoidable; and I am in fact -\nlike to look to the purposes of this statute, that if\nsomething says \"day\" I can't say it means \"night.\" And\nso -- so what --what is it about this word that allows\nus to say that it's avoidable?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I think the answer to\nthat actually came in a question that Justice Ginsburg\nposed to Mr. Frederick, which is that unavoidable is\nbeing used in the sense of okay; what are the vaccines\nthat FDA has approved that CDC has recommended for\nroutine administration to children, and that are the -\nand that are the ones that the Federal Government has\ndetermined are appropriate therefore to protect the\npublic health? And given that that is the state of\naffairs that we are in, was this injury -\nJUSTICE BREYER: To show that -- remember\nthey only want to say, because of special circumstances\nthis is an avoidable -- this is an avoidable injury. I\nthink I am right on that.\nAnd -- and so the best place to look in your\nopinion, for me to look, to show that this word\nunavoidable includes that avoidable claim, is where?\nMR. HORWICH: I think the way to understand\nit is -- is to see that as the -- as the committee\nreport -- as the '86 committee report says, that what\nCongress is trying to convey in using the word\nunavoidable is it is -- it is respecting the principle\nof comment k, which is the principle that socially\nbeneficial products that nonetheless have these adverse\neffects ought to be on the market and we ought not to\nallow tort law to push them off the market, which is\nexactly what -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me -- going back\nto the point you just started with -\nMR. HORWICH: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- which was is this -\nis the Control -- Disease Center, is it making a\njudgment before it approves a drug for licensing, that\nit's the most efficacious drug on market?\nMR. HORWICH: CDC does not issue a license.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No -\nMR. HORWICH: But the way the statute works\nis that the statute only covers, in its present form,\nthe way -- I'm referring now to the present version of\nthe provision in the statute that explains how vaccines\nbecome subject to the Act, because not all vaccines are.\nThe provision is in 14(e) of the Act, which I believe\nmay not be reproduced in any of the papers, but it\nbasically says that two things have to happen. One is\nthat before the vaccine becomes subject to either the\ncompensation program or the preemption provision -- is\nthat CDC has to recommend it for routine administration.\nAnd that is a judgment that CDC makes with the advice of\nthe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where do I look at that?\nAt what documents do I look at to make a judgment that\nin fact, CDC is doing what I ask, that it is looking at\nthe question of whether this is the most efficacious\ndrug with the least adverse effects? Is that a judgment\nit's making?\nMR. HORWICH: Yes. Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We know the FDA is not.\nAre you representing to us right now that CDC makes that\njudgment?\nMR. HORWICH: CDC makes that judgment and\nannounces it in a reasoned, published announcement in\nits official journal which is the Morbidity and\nMortality Weekly Report.\nAnd so for every drug -- or excuse me, for\nevery vaccine that it recommends for routine\nadministration, it publishes a notice in its journal\nexplaining, this is -- these are the products that we\nare recommending for routine use, this is the -- the\nstudies, this is the development of them, this is our\nbasis for this determination. And so --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That would include\ncomparisons to other drugs on the market?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, it -- there often won't\nbe other drugs actually on the market to compare it to,\nbut there will be -- there will be a vast body of\nscientific literature that again is not exclusively\nwithin the manufacturers' control, because it has been\nproduced by the Federal Government, by other countries'\npublic health agencies, by academic scientists, that CDC\nwill reference or its advisory committee will have\nincorporated in its recommendation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it doesn't make a\ndetermination that the one that they are listing in\ntheir morbidity report is better than one that's out\nthere? This is a situation where there were two of them\nout there.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, there -- there were not\ntwo out there, Mr. Chief Justice. At the time of this\nthere was -- there were two forms of the -- out there -\nI'm sorry, if I can ask at what time you are referring\nto?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the comparison\nbetween the vaccine that caused the harm and the one\nthat Mr. Frederick's client says was more efficacious\nand therefore the harms were avoidable.\nMR. HORWICH: Right, and I'm not -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There must be a\nsituation where the Centers for Disease Control approve,\nalert people to the fact that there is a particular\nvaccine that they think manufacturers should -- should\nproduce, and there is another vaccine addressed to the\nsame disease already on the market. That's never the\ncase? They must improve the vaccine -\nMR. HORWICH: Yes, certainly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- or we wouldn't\nhave this case.\nMR. HORWICH: Certainly they do. And I\nmean, the Federal Government -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When they publish\nthat information in their weekly report, do they compare\nit both with respect to losses or mortality and with\nrespect to efficiency, with -- to the other vaccines on\nthe market.\nMR. HORWICH: Yes. Let me give you an\nexcellent example of that which is probably familiar to\nthe Court, that there are two types polio vaccines.\nThere is the Sabin vaccine, with is associated with\ncertain very rare but serious side effects but which is\nextremely efficacious at protecting a population, and\nthen there is the Salk vaccine, which is not associated\nwith those same side effects, but is not as effective at\nprotecting the population.\nNow CDC made a determination and this was a\ndetermination in effect from the 1960s through the\n1990s, that the Sabin vaccine -- the one that is, quote,\nunquote, \"less safe,\" was the appropriate one for use\nbecause it better served the public health. Now as\npolio -- now this is a dynamic process that CDC is\ncontinually engaged in, and so as polio approached\nglobal eradication and you are not as concerned about\nactual control of disease running in the community, CDC\ntransitioned its recommendation to the Salk vaccine.\nSo I -- I think that answers the question\nthat the CDC is making determinations in this regard in\na comparative way; and I think it would be extraordinary\nthen to have juries -- to have -- to imagine that\nCongress set up a system in which juries would\neffectively be second-guessing decisions like that,\nbecause CDC has made -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It has not only\ngiven that information; it has also said in its weekly\nreport that this is the one we want you to make.\nMR. HORWICH: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They are not lawyers; they\nare scientists.\nMR. HORWICH: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So they may not use these\nexact words, but you are saying whatever word they use,\nwhat they have is an ongoing process to say this is the\nbest vaccine available; is that right?\nMR. HORWICH: Yes. And part of the on going\nprocess, as we described in our brief, is a unique\nsystem of monitoring and following up when there are\nadverse events. So that we gave the example of the -\nJUSTICE BREYER: The committees have\nmanufacturers on them and Government scientists and\nuniversity people and others?\nMR. HORWICH: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE BREYER: The committees have\nmanufacturers and Government scientists and university\nprofessors and others?\nMR. HORWICH: My understanding is actually\nthe manufacturers are -- are -- are relatively less\nrepresented on these -- on these committees. In a sense\nthat the manufacturers are sometimes doing the\nmanufacturing, but a lot of the research agenda is\nreally driven by the Federal Government.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Horwich, would you -\nwould you explain one feature of this, it was the\nallegation that there were an unusual number of adverse\nreactions to the particular lot that this child's third\nvaccine came from, and that those adverse reactions were\nnot disclosed to the doctors. And the doctors -- the\nchild's doctor said if I had known about the unusual\nnumber of adverse reactions, I never would have used\nthis vaccine.\nIs there any actionable claim for that, for\nnot disclosing that there were a number of adverse -- an\nunusual number of adverse reactions to this particular\nlot.\nMR. HORWICH: If -- if I may?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMR. HORWICH: Yes, absolutely there is,\nbecause that claim is either in the nature of a labeling\nclaim or in the nature of a manufacturing defect claim.\nAnd the -- the district court here and the court of\nappeals both treated that question not under preemption\nbut on the facts, summary judgment in this case was\ngranted purely on the absence of a disputed issue of\nmaterial fact -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. HORWICH: -- with respect to those\nclaims.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Frederick, take\nfive minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you.\nThe only law cited by the Government today\nwas section 14 of the Vaccine Act. It is not reproduced\nin the materials, but it is -- the title of section 14\nis a vaccine injury table. It's about recommendations\nthat the CDC makes as to which vaccines will be on the\nvaccine table, so that when the person goes throughout\nvaccine court process, you can look and determine\nwhether or not on a no-fault basis the vaccine is listed\non the table or not listed on the table.\nJUSTICE ALITO: May I ask you this question\nabout something that Mr. Horwich said? Under your\nunderstanding of this scheme, if a -- a person suffered\na very serious injury as a result of the Sabin vaccine\nduring the period when the CDC recommended that over the\nSalk vaccine, would the -- would that injured person\nhave a claim for design defect if the person could -\ncould produce experts who said the CDC was wrong, that\nthey should never have made this recommendation?\nMR. FREDERICK: It's not that the CDC would\nbe wrong, Justice Alito. There is a difference between\nstrict liability and a no-fault arrangement and where\nnegligence would be asserted that a reasonable\nmanufacturer would have come forward with information\nabout a safer design.\nSo what Congress explicitly rejected and\nthey voted this down in the Energy and Commerce\nCommittee was a regulatory compliance defense solely on\nthe basis that the FDA had approved at the time -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, this may be -- this\nmay be what Congress wanted and may be the better\npolicy, but your answer to my question is that -\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- that would permit a lay\njury relying on experts produced in court, the CDC got\nthis wrong, the Salk vaccine was really the better one.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, yes, that would be a\nviable design defect claim. And let me give you an\nexample right out of the Joint Appendix in this case.\nIn 1965 Lederle's researchers determine that Lily, the\nTri-Solgen, had a \"superior product,\" that's at page 245\nof the Joint Appendix. That was in 1967. Eight years\nlater the internal scientists at Lederle wrote a memo to\nthe head of Lederle and said we recommend that we\napproach Lily for its pertussis vaccine process and/or\ncontinue to bid on foreign contracts for this product\nline with the intent of increasing volume.\nThey had made the determination they were\nnot capable internally of doing a safer design and they\nknew that for eight years and they nonetheless kept the\nwholesale pertussis in its market and the documents in\nthis case indicate they did it for economic reasons.\nAnd the whole idea behind having design defect claims is\nto put manufacturers to the duty of putting out safest\npossible products in light of what the science holds.\nThe CDC -- there are no regulations that the\nGovernment cites in its brief or today saying that the\nCDC does the kind of comparative analysis for safety\nthat is provided under State law design defect claims.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Their argument is that the\nCDC will do it better than juries. That's what I heard\nhim say.\nMR. FREDERICK: And, Justice Breyer, there\nare now six DTaP vaccines on the market that CDC doesn't\ndistinguish between them, but if it comes to pass that\nthe science would indicate that one of them was woefully\nnot as safe, and here, their argument is that the\nvaccine industry is going to go out of business. This\nvaccine that's at issue in this case was taken off the\nmarket in 1998.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought\nMr. Horwich told me that the CDC does compare new\nvaccines to the ones that are out in the market?\nMR. FREDERICK: He cited no law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think he was\nincorrect in that assertion. We can go back and look at\nthese weekly reports and they are either going to say\nthis is better than the one that's out there or they are\nnot.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. And if you compare\nthat to what Congress wrote in the statute, our\nsubmission is that Congress's words in section 22 take\nprecedence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm just trying to\nfind out what your position is on that. Do they compare\nit to existing vaccines or not?\nMR. FREDERICK: We found no law that gives\nthe CDC the authority.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not asking about\nlaw, I'm asking matter of fact.\nMR. FREDERICK: Whether, I'm not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You open up the\nweekly report.\nMR. FREDERICK: I'm sorry,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you open up the\nweekly report and it says this new vaccine is better\nvaccine than the one that is out there or not?\nMR. FREDERICK: I'm not aware that the CDC\ndoes the kind of granular comparisons that would go to\nthe level of safety that is at issue in this kind of\ncase. And that's what's important here. We are talking\nabout trying to eliminate some of the most horrifying\nand horrible incidents of injury to vaccines that we\ncompel children to take.\nAnd the whole idea behind Congress's scheme\nwas to balance having vaccine supply available with\nproviding a generous form of compensation to those\npersons who would be injured.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
