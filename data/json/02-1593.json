        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 02-1593, BedRoc Limited and Western Elite v.\nthe United States.\nMr. McCrum.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF R. TIMOTHY McCRUM\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. McCRUM: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case began in 1993 when the Bureau of Land\nManagement issued notices of trespass for the extraction\nof common sand and gravel from private land in the Nevada\ndesert about 60 miles from Las Vegas.\nThe central issue in this case is whether, under\nthe 1919 Pittman Act, the reservation of valuable minerals\nincluded common sand and gravel that were -- that were\nwidespread and made up the bulk of the land.\nNow, the purpose of the Pittman Act was to\ndevelop the State of Nevada by granting private land to\ncitizens who made personal sacrifices to discover and\ndevelop underground sources of water that was not -- that\nwere not previously known.\nQUESTION: It applied only in Nevada, did it\nnot?\nMR. McCRUM: Yes, Your Honor.\nNow, Mabel and Newton Butler in this case\nexplored and found a -- a source of underground water and\nobtained a land patent from the United States Government\nin 1940.\nAs we've explained in the briefs, the plain\nmeaning of the words valuable minerals, as used in the\n1919 Pittman Act, did not include the sand and gravel at\nissue here because these common earthen materials in the\nNevada desert were not included in the contemporaneous\nlegal understanding of the term mineral when the act was\npassed in 1919 and these materials did not have intrinsic\nvalue at the time of the enactment of the act in 1990 --\n1919 and at the time of the patent granting in 1940.\nQUESTION: Does the gravel excavation take up\nwhat? About 16 to 20 acres out of some 500, which is the\ntotal surface area or?\nMR. McCRUM: Yes, Justice Kennedy. That's --\nthat's the approximate size at the time BLM conducted its\nreport in 1999 or so.\nQUESTION: Do we know, is that the sum total of\nthe gravel that's there? Could they -- does it go on for\nthe -- another 100 acres or so?\nMR. McCRUM: We have photographs of the site in\nthe joint appendix of the case that show the area of the\n-- of the land in the general vicinity to be essentially\nthe same. It's common. Sand and gravel is -- is pretty\nmuch covering that whole general area.\nNow, the Pittman Act's structure reserved\nvaluable minerals to the Government in section 8, and at\nthe same time it did that, it provided that those reserved\nvaluable minerals would be subject to location and\ndevelopment by others. At that time, the -- the\nexpectation of how this -- how these materials would be\ndeveloped, whatever was reserved as valuable minerals, was\nunder the 1872 Mining Law which itself applied to valuable\nminerals. So those were --\nQUESTION: Are you now -- the time you're\nreferring to is 1919 or 1940?\nMR. McCRUM: 1919, Mr. Chief Justice.\nAt that -- in -- in the act itself, it provided\nfor location to occur of the reserved valuable mineral\nestate under the 1872 Mining Law. So, therefore, it's --\nit's quite important to look --\nQUESTION: Mr. McCrum, you left out one word in\nthe Mining Law. It didn't say valuable minerals. It\nsaid, valuable mineral deposits, and there's a significant\ndifference between -- a lump of silver might be\ntremendously valuable, but it wouldn't be a deposit if\nthat's all there was.\nMR. McCRUM: Your Honor is -- is correct that\nvaluable mineral deposits is the -- is the language\nreferred to in -- in 30 U.S.C., section 22 of the 1872\nMining Law. 30 U.S.C., section 21 actually refers to\nvaluable mineral lands. And those terms were really\nviewed as quite similar by the Interior Department at the\ntime, and the question was whether a particular type of\nmineral was -- was within the class of minerals that the\n1872 Mining Law was subject to.\nAnd in 1919, if an individual sought to\nestablish a mining claim for common sand and gravel,\nclaiming a discovery of valuable minerals in 1919, it is\nquite clear and certain how the Interior Department would\nhave addressed that in 1919.\ndenied the patent and rejected the application of the 1872\nMining Law to common sand and gravel.\nNow, we know that because we can look to the\npublished Interior Department decisions of the day which\nwere published at that time, as they are now, available\nfor citizens, as well as the Congress to -- to look at.\nAnd the repeated decisions from 1901, in particular,\nthrough 1919 made it very clear that common earthen\nmaterials, such as clay, sand and gravel, used for road\nbase, cement-making purposes, things of that nature, were\nsimply not subject to the -- the Mining Law.\nQUESTION: Now, what would -- what would Land\nManagement have done in 1940?\nMR. McCRUM: In -- by 1940, the -- the Interior\nDepartment had modified its view in 1929 and there said\nthat -- that sand and gravel could be subject to the\nMining Law if valuable on a site-specific basis. And\nunder that modified view, adopted by Interior in 1929 in\nthe Layman v. Ellis decision, it confirmed the importance\nof assessing the marketability on a site-specific basis.\nQUESTION: At -- at the time of the patent?\nMR. McCRUM: At -- well, the Layman decision\ninvolved a -- a question of whether it was valuable at the\ntime of the patent in that case, which was a Mining Law\npatent being considered.\nDepartment, looking at the -- at the position that Layman\nv. Ellis took, applied that in the context of a mineral\nreservation, as we have here, and said in the context of a\nmineral reservation, if it's to include these -- these\ncommon materials, it can only include those materials when\nthere is value at the time of the patent.\nQUESTION: You say the Interior Department took\nthat position. How? Was that a -- a solicitor's opinion\nor what?\nMR. McCRUM: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. That was in\na solicitor's opinion in 1956. It's a solicitor's opinion\nwhich this Court took note of in the Western Nuclear\ndecision in 1983 and -- and relied on.\nQUESTION: Well, Western Nuclear certainly cuts\nthe other way from your argument here today. I didn't\nagree with the holding, but that was the holding of the\nCourt. It was under a different act, not the Pittman Act,\nbut certainly very similar.\nMR. McCRUM: Justice O'Connor, the Western\nNuclear decision did hold that gravel could be reserved\nunder the Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916, but\nimportantly, the issue of whether that sand and gravel had\nto be valuable at the time of the patent was not addressed\nin the holding of the Court, as the Government has\nacknowledged in its brief.\nQUESTION: Well, wasn't that because the word\nvaluable didn't include in the -- wasn't included in the\nreservation of Stock-Raisers Act?\nMR. McCRUM: It -- it could well have been --\nthat -- that could have been part of the Court's thinking.\nIn -- in the Pittman Act, we do have an emphasis on the\nterm, valuable minerals, in the plain language of the\nstatute, and certainly that is a further reason why the\nelement of value is all the more important in this case,\nboth at the time of enactment in 1919, as well as at -- at\nthe 1940 patent.\nQUESTION: Why couldn't it be that the -- the\nword valuable doesn't mean at the time of the patent? It\nmeans reserves the mineral rights, and if and when they\nprove valuable, the Government will assert its right. I\nmean, one could imagine a metal that was not considered\nworth anything. Let's just suppose that was the view of\nuranium. And then years later, one realizes the\ntremendous value of that metal. Would one say that, well,\nbecause when the patent was granted, no one had any idea\nhow valuable this would be, therefore when it turns out\nthat it is indeed very valuable, the United States hasn't\nany reserved rights?\nMR. McCRUM: Well, Your Honor, that -- that\ncould be a possible construction, but in this case the\nInterior Department in the 1956 solicitor's opinion took\nnote of the common nature of sand and gravel and how\nwidespread it is across the western public domain and\nrecognized that there was a need to look at -- at value on\na site-specific marketability basis, which was actually\nconsistent with the -- the approach the Department took in\nthe Layman v. Ellis decision in -- in 1929, looking at the\nsite-specific marketability of sand and gravel, because\nunlike a precious metal like gold which, once you extract\nit, it can be sold on an international market without\nregard to transportation costs and has intrinsic value,\nsand and gravel and -- and similar materials are -- are\ncommon and widespread across the western public domain\nand, in fact, across the country. And it is only where\nyou have a market on a site-specific basis that you can\nhave value established.\nQUESTION: What would happen, though, if you --\nwhat -- would any bad thing happen if the words were\ninterpreted to mean any mineral at all that ever becomes\nvaluable in the future so that then a person who bought\nthis land could never take anything off of it? The\nGovernment would have the right to all the dirt. Anything\nthat he -- anything that the individual sold, he couldn't\nsell. It would be the Government that would have to sell\nit.\nhappen?\nMR. McCRUM: Justice Breyer, if -- if you took\nthat interpretation, you would have western landowners\nessentially being -- having a very, very limited surface\n-- surface estate interest that would essentially be at\nthe discretion of the Government where when local -- local\ndemands for these materials arose, the Government at any\ntime could come in and assert that they have ownership of\nthese widespread common materials which would actually\ndestroy -- potentially destroy the value of the land and\n-- and further, eliminate any private incentives to\ndevelop the private land, which was the intent of Congress\nin 1919.\nQUESTION: One -- one way to -- to rule for your\nclient here would be for the Court to hold that it is not\na mineral if it can't be removed without disturbing the --\nthe surface, and that certainly would resolve this case.\nI'm hesitant to say that, though, because of the placer\nmining of gold, et cetera. Could you comment on that?\nMR. McCRUM: Yes, Justice Kennedy. We are not\nadvocating such a rule, although it certainly in this case\nbears -- is certainly a significant factor that this\ncommon, widespread material actually would essentially\ndestroy the surface of the land.\nQUESTION:\nWhat -- what are we to do with that factor? I just don't\nsee how you can get the gravel without completely\ndestroying the -- the surface use that -- that the owner\nmight want to put to it --\nMR. McCRUM: Well --\nQUESTION: -- assuming there's a different\nowner. This -- this happens to be the owner that makes\nthat choice.\nMR. McCRUM: Yes. Justice Kennedy, it's just\nthat type of factor that have caused the vast majority of\nState and Federal court decisions that have addressed the\nquestion of whether gravel is a reserved mineral in any\ntype of private conveyance and cases involving the\nGovernment where they acquire a surface interest that have\ncaused these -- the Federal and State courts to rule\nalmost uniformly that gravel is not a -- a reserved\nmineral in the absence of some express intent to indicate\nthat it should be reserved.\nQUESTION: Of course, but you're -- you're in\nthat boat too. I mean, you -- you acknowledge that if the\nsand and gravel was valuable at the time the patent was\nissued, the Government would -- would own it under the\nmineral reservation. So, I mean, despite the fact that\nyou'd have to chew up the surface land to -- to get at it\nwith a commercial value. Right?\nMR. McCRUM: Well, Justice Scalia, we -- we --\nso, I mean, we have two positions here and -- and one is\nthat sand and gravel was -- was not reasonably within the\n-- the meaning of this phrase as it was -- was used in\n1919 considering the common legal understanding which had\n-- had been developed by the Interior Department quite\nclearly between 1901 and 1919 that made it very clear that\n-- that common, widespread sand and gravel was not what\nthe -- was not what was considered to be a valuable\nmineral at that time.\nQUESTION: Well, if it wouldn't be considered a\nvaluable -- I mean, that -- that does bring you into --\ninto contradiction of our prior cases because if that --\nif that were so, it wouldn't have been considered a\nmineral either, it seems to me.\nMR. McCRUM: That's correct, Justice Scalia, but\nwe -- we -- in this case we do have the further express\nlanguage of -- of valuable.\nQUESTION: Yes, the problem is you have Western\nNuclear, which said that gravel was a mineral. Now you've\ngot a statute in the Pittman Act that says valuable\nminerals, which brings you to your fall-back position\nwhich is that if at the time of patenting the land it\nwasn't valuable commercially, then it isn't covered. Is\nthat right?\nMR. McCRUM: Yes, Justice O'Connor. If -- if\nthe Western Nuclear precedent is followed and applied to\nthe 1919 Pittman Act, then our -- our primary position is\nthat the material was not valuable at the time of patent.\nQUESTION: It's a little odd in this Pittman Act\nbecause it -- it does in section 8 refer to valuable\nminerals, but at various other times in the act, it just\nsays minerals.\nMR. McCRUM: In -- in section 8 of the Pittman\nAct, it -- the statute makes it quite clear that only\nvaluable minerals are reserved. And then it -- in -- in\nlater parts of that section, it refers to, and the mineral\nso reserved shall be disposed in accordance with law. I\ndon't think that changes the -- the meaning of the\nreservation, and it's further confirmed here by the actual\npatent issued by the Interior Department in the joint\nappendix where only valuable minerals are reserved in the\npatent.\nQUESTION: Suppose --\nQUESTION: Is that term used in any other act\nthat we'd be concerned with the term, valuable minerals,\nas a reservation?\nMR. McCRUM: Not as a reservation that I'm aware\nof, Your Honor, but it is -- is, of course, quite similar\nto the language used in the 1872 Mining Law which\ndescribed what -- what -- how -- what would be done with\nthe reserved mineral estate.\nQUESTION: Suppose -- and -- and it's only a\nsupposition -- that we were to reconsider our -- our\nearlier case, Western Nuclear, and -- and overrule it. It\n-- it seems to me that then -- then there would be chaotic\nlawsuits to follow because there would not -- not have\nbeen intentional trespasses but the wrong people would\nhave been extracting the minerals if there had ever been a\n-- a grant by the Government to -- to a person other than\nthe owner of the fee. Is there any precedent in the Court\nfor how we unwind the -- the clock, or whatever the\nmetaphor is?\nMR. McCRUM: Well, as we -- as we point out in\nour reply brief, Justice Kennedy, the amount of land that\nis potentially subject to contract issued by the\nGovernment for gravel on reserved mineral estates appears\nto be on the order of less than two-tenths of 1 percent of\nthe lands patented under the Stock-Raising Homestead Act.\nSo the vast majority of private lands at stake would --\nwould not be affected by a ruling except to the extent\nthat it would confirm that the landowner has the common\nsand and gravel that -- that was part of the land\nconveyed.\nQUESTION:\nposition would extend only to Nevada, I take it, and the\nfact that it was valuable would be distinguishing from the\nWestern Nuclear case.\nMR. McCRUM: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. The -- the\nPittman Act itself applies solely in Nevada and regardless\nof whether the Court were to reconsider Western Nuclear,\nwe think that Western Nuclear should certainly not be\nextended to this act which has the term, valuable\nminerals, express in the statute and where the time of\npatenting issue was not addressed by Western Nuclear, as\nthe Government acknowledges. There's no issue of stare\ndecisis if -- if the Court is to say the time of patent is\nparamount, as the Interior Department itself has held in\nthe 1956 solicitor's opinion and as the Tenth Circuit\nruled in the Hess case only last fall.\nQUESTION: Mr. McCrum, I don't understand what\nyour response to Justice Ginsburg's question is under your\nfall-back position. That is to say, what do you do with\nuranium which was not regarded as a valuable mineral when\nthe patent was issued and nowadays is regarded as a very\nvaluable mineral? What happens to uranium under your\nfall-back position?\nMR. McCRUM: Yes, Justice Scalia. Uranium is\nclearly a rare, valuable mineral. Whether or not it\nwas --\nQUESTION: Oh, it is now. It wasn't then.\nMR. McCRUM: Yes.\nQUESTION: I mean, it was rare but not valuable.\nMR. McCRUM: Yes, and -- and therefore, it is --\nit is clearly within the class of minerals that the --\nthat the 1872 Mining Law applied. It has --\nQUESTION: Well, why is it if it's not valuable?\nI mean, that -- that's the problem. If it wasn't valuable\nat the time of patenting, what do you do with it? It\nseems to me that if -- if your argument is going to be\nconsistent, you're going to say the -- the Government\nhasn't reserved the right to uranium.\nMR. McCRUM: Justice Souter, the -- uranium is\nclearly of a -- a valuable, rare nature.\nQUESTION: No, but you're changing the\nhypothesis. Justice Scalia's question was, if it wasn't\nvaluable at the time of the patent, but we have now\ndiscovered uses for it so that it is valuable, what do you\ndo with uranium? And I would have thought that your\nposition would be the Government loses on uranium too.\nMR. McCRUM: Of course, the Court may -- may\nview it that way, Justice Souter. The -- the way I would\nview it is that uranium is a rare, valuable mineral,\nsimilar to gold, silver, lead, and zinc, and it's very\ndifferent --\nQUESTION: Well, I guess you could take the\nposition that a mineral like uranium has some intrinsic\nvalue, very little as of 1919 and more today, but that\nsand and gravel neither in 1919 nor today has any\nintrinsic value as a mineral. It is only when it is\nlocated near an urban center and therefore has value as a\nconvenience. I suppose that would be your argument.\nMR. McCRUM: Yes, Justice O'Connor. Thank you.\nThat -- that is -- that is precisely the distinction.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. McCRUM: That is precisely the distinction.\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, you -- you could say\nuranium only has -- only -- has no intrinsic value. It\nonly has value if you're splitting atoms. I mean, you can\nmake the same -- the same argument about uranium.\nMR. McCRUM: But uranium is -- is not dependent\nupon local transportation costs in the way that sand and\ngravel was, and that is the fundamental distinction --\nQUESTION: This must have come up under -- under\n-- it has nothing to do with -- I don't think, with the\nword valuable. It has to do with the word minerals\ncovered in leases all over the country. So it must have\ncome up in this other context too. Western Nuclear,\nputting that aside, that somebody looks at titanium or\nsome -- something.\nthink it would be true of every mineral lease, that --\nthat you have some kind of a mineral that had no value in\n1500 or 1919 and today it's fabulous. And -- and does --\nare they -- do they cover them or don't they cover them?\nMaybe you don't know. I don't know, but I don't see that\nthe word value has much to do with it.\nMR. McCRUM: The -- the way that it has come up\nis -- would be in the -- the most analogous way that I can\nthink of is in the context of the 1872 Mining Law where,\nalthough that language was enacted in 1872, the Interior\nDepartment has had no trouble with the administration of\nthat law determining that -- that uranium is subject to\nlocation as a mining claim under the 1872 --\nQUESTION: It was a mineral in 1500. I mean,\nnobody --\nQUESTION: Yes, but everything was.\nQUESTION: -- nobody disputes that it was a\nmineral, which is what the -- what the mining act says.\nThe -- the issue is whether it's a valuable mineral. In\nyour fall-back position, you're placing a lot of weight on\nthe adjective valuable, and that -- that created problems\nwith -- with uranium.\nQUESTION: Didn't we have a case that involved,\nwas it methane, that was thought not only did it have no\nvalue, but it was a positive detriment to have it? And\nthen years later it turned out to be something very\nvaluable.\nMR. McCRUM: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that would\nhave been the Amoco v. Southern Ute case in 1999. There\nthe question is -- was whether under the contemporaneous\nunderstanding in 1909 and 1910 did coal include coal bed\nmethane. The Court looked to that common understanding\nand common meaning and said, no, it didn't. And that's\nprecisely the same approach we're asking the Court to\nfollow here.\nQUESTION: So who had the reserve? Didn't\nsomebody have reserved rights in it?\nMR. McCRUM: Yes. The -- the Government had\ninitially reserved coal and -- and the question was\nwhether that pure coal reservation extended to the coal\nbed methane within the coal, and the -- and the Court\nconcluded no. So it -- it is -- it is a case that we rely\non to look to the contemporaneous interpretation and\nunderstanding at the time.\nAnd here, sand and gravel was well known. It\nwas widespread, and there were repeated Interior\nDepartment decisions that said this is not the type of\nmineral that is subject to the 1872 Mining Law as a -- as\na valuable mineral.\nQUESTION:\nan argument that hasn't specifically come up this morning?\nAnd, first, I just want to tell you what my -- my\nunderstanding of the argument is and -- and you tell me if\nI've got it wrong.\nI thought one of your arguments was that it was\nimportant to know whether the mineral was valuable or not\nat the time of the patent or the deed because the -- the\ngrantee, the patentee, ought to know, in effect, the\nextent to which his -- his land grant is -- is jeopardized\nby the Government's right to come in. He ought to be able\nmake a rough judgment as to whether at some point they're\ngoing to come in and start extracting things. Is -- is\nthat a fair statement?\nMR. McCRUM: Yes, Justice Souter. Correct.\nQUESTION: My -- my question is this. If -- if\nthat is the reason for saying we should look to value at\nthe time of the patent, isn't that an argument that is at\nodds with your position that if the mineral is valuable at\nthe time, it is reserved? Because -- the reason I say\nthat is this. There may be gold under the land, but the\npatentee doesn't know it and the Government doesn't know\nit. So that there is no way, at the time the deed passes,\nthat the person taking that deed is going to be able to\nknow whether, at some point in the future, the Government\nis going to come in and -- and start drilling a mining\nshaft in the land.\nSo my question is, regardless of what the date\nat -- at which value is established, isn't it the case\nthat these patentees never really know whether at some\nfuture time the Government is going to come in and start\ndrilling? And if that is so, why should the patent date\nbe important?\nMR. McCRUM: Justice Souter, you're -- you're\ncorrect that there is -- there's always some level of\nuncertainty when a party takes land subject to a mineral\nreservation. But the distinction that is important that\nthe Interior Department has long recognized and -- and\nthat the Federal and State courts have recognized is that\nin the case of a common, widespread material such as\ngravel, it is -- it is the value at the time of patent\nwhich needs to be looked to. And that's what --\nQUESTION: So are you saying basically, look,\nthat's the way we've done it and you ought to defer to the\npractice? Is that -- I mean --\nMR. McCRUM: We are -- we are --\nQUESTION: -- is that the foundation for your\nargument?\nMR. McCRUM: We are saying that this is the way\nthe Interior Department itself has done it, and this --\nand this is the Interior Department that here is asserting\na different rule today. And the Interior Department and\nthe decisions of this Court have recognized a distinction\nbetween common material such as sand and gravel and\nprecious metals and other materials that have intrinsic\nvalue and recognized a distinction to look to\nmarketability and local, site-specific factors.\nQUESTION: When -- when you say today about --\nand you cite the opinion of the solicitor from 1956, but\nthe position that the Government is arguing today in this\nCourt is not new. This is hardly the first time the\nGovernment has taken the position that sand and gravel can\nbe valuable minerals.\nMR. McCRUM: Justice Ginsburg, the -- the\nposition -- the litigation position which the Government\nis taking here today that value does not matter at the\ntime of patenting actually has -- is not supported by\nInterior Department decisions. We are relying on the 1956\nsolicitor's opinion. This Court referred approvingly to\nthe opinion in -- in Western Nuclear. That opinion has\nnever been overruled by the Interior Department and the --\nand the Interior Department offers no other interpretation\nof -- on that issue as -- as something that this Court\nshould rely on.\nA further reason that we think that -- that\nthese issues should be resolved in a -- in a fair manner\nis the application of the Leo Sheep precedent of this\nCourt which recognizes the sacrifice and -- and -- that\nhave been made by the private individuals in obtaining\nthese patents and the inducement that the Government\ncarried out in encouraging parties to make these\nsacrifices to obtain these lands. And the purpose of the\nact would be defeated to -- if -- if the Government is\nable to later reserve common sand and gravel.\nQUESTION: But they didn't -- they didn't make\nsacrifices to get the sand and gravel.\nMR. McCRUM: Justice Stevens, they made\nsacrifices to get the land, and the sand and gravel makes\nup the bulk of the land. And if the Government can later\ncome back and say, that sand and gravel is ours now that\nit has acquired some economic worth, it really defeats the\npurpose of putting the lands into -- into private\nownership.\nQUESTION: You're saying it makes up the bulk of\nthe land? I mean, I can understand that you would have an\nargument maybe for -- for limiting what the government can\ntake if out of your, whatever it is, 600 acres, you know,\n590 are gravel and the Government says, too bad, we're\ntaking it all. But as I understand it, we -- we have not\ngotten any issue in this case or in other cases about an\ninequitable enforcement of the -- of the extraction\ncondition. Am I wrong about that?\nMR. McCRUM: Justice Souter, the Government's\nposition is that they own all the common sand and gravel\nthat makes up this entire parcel of land. As -- as much\nas the extraction operations may continue, the Government\nwould continue to take the view that they own every bit of\nit based upon the decision of the -- of the Ninth Circuit\nbelow.\nQUESTION: Well, you'd have an argument on the\nfirst prong of Western Nuclear if they took that position\nin fact, wouldn't you?\nMR. McCRUM: Well --\nQUESTION: I mean, that -- that would be\ninconsistent with the -- with the purpose of the grant in\nthe first place I suppose.\nMR. McCRUM: We do -- we do believe that -- that\nwe -- that the Government's position is -- is contrary to\nWestern Nuclear in the sense that it is not -- that it --\nthat it is relying on the value of the sand and gravel\ntoday without regard to what the value was in --\nQUESTION: No, no, but I'm talking about the\nextent of it. Does -- does the record indicate that the\n-- that the -- that you have claimed that -- that one\nbasis for -- that you should win this case is that the\nGovernment, in effect, will take, as you put it, the bulk\nof the property if they win? Is -- is that in the record?\nMR. McCRUM: What is in the record is that -- is\nthat this sand and gravel deposit is extracted from the\nsurface, that the -- that the character of the land is\nwidespread, abundant common sand and gravel. The -- the\nphotographs in the record show that the land is of the\nsame character. The Government's position in this case is\nthat they own the sand and gravel wherever it may be on\nthat property. And -- and I think there's no question\nthat it comprises the bulk of the land, and -- and I\nwouldn't expect the Government to dispute that here today.\nQUESTION: You wish to reserve the balance of\nyour time, Mr. McCrum?\nMR. McCRUM: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Very well.\nWe'll hear from you, Mr. Sansonetti.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. SANSONETTI\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SANSONETTI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nQUESTION: Mr. Sansonetti, I looked in the -- to\nget some statistics about what Nevada was like in 1940,\nand it had a -- a total population of 110,000. It has an\narea of 100,000 square miles, which is about 1 person per\nsquare mile. Las Vegas had a population of 8,000. This\nproperty is 65 miles away from Las Vegas.\nDoes the Government say that it -- that this was\na valuable mineral in 1940 when the patent was issued?\nAnd if not, when did it become valuable?\nMR. SANSONETTI: The United States is saying\nthat the sand and gravel was, indeed, valuable as a matter\nof a category of minerals. In other words, the category\nof sand and gravel was valuable actually, we're saying, as\nfar back as 1919, that the actual passage date of the\nPittman Act in 1919 was the exact time that sand and\ngravel was valuable.\nQUESTION: Well, dirt is valuable on that basis.\nI mean, people buy topsoil. And, you know, if you're in\nan area where -- where a lot of people need topsoil, I\nsuppose you'd say dirt is valuable.\nMR. SANSONETTI: In that case I wouldn't,\nthough, Your Honor, because topsoil also mixes both\norganic and inorganic materials. And the test that the --\nthat the Court set out in Western Nuclear was four-legged,\nand the four-part test for a mineral was that it be\ninorganic. Extractable from the soil was the second leg.\nThird one was usable for a commercial purpose, and the\nfourth one was that the -- the mineral was not somehow to\nbe included in the use of the surface estate.\nQUESTION:\nwhich wasn't covered by Western Nuclear?\nMR. SANSONETTI: That would not be a problem in\nthis particular instance, Mr. Chief Justice, because sand\nand the gravel are really just a matter of size. In\norder, they go silt, sand, gravel, cobble, building stone.\nQUESTION: So you say that's no problem for the\nGovernment. The Government gets the sand too?\nMR. SANSONETTI: Oh, yes, because sand is a\nmineral.\nQUESTION: It's a problem for me, even if it's\nnot for you.\nMR. SANSONETTI: Yes, yes.\nQUESTION: Doesn't the Government get -- I mean,\nit gets everything. I mean, what -- what is it -- I mean,\nyou -- mud is made into adobe bricks. I mean, and -- so\nit gets absolutely everything except for the 6 inches or\nso that maybe was mixed up that you could grow corn in.\nAnd I don't even understand why they wouldn't get that too\nif they wanted it.\nMR. SANSONETTI: Now, I think that the first\nthing we have to do is take a look at the purposes of the\npassage of both the Stock-Raising Homestead Act and the\nPittman Act.\nQUESTION: Am I right in thinking the Government\ngets absolutely everything with the possible exception\nbecause of the fourth point of Western Nuclear that I'm\nnot sure why it even came in, but that if it's mixed with\nsomething you could grow something in, then they don't get\nit. But everything else is the Government's.\nMR. SANSONETTI: Surface, yes. Minerals, no.\nThe -- the Justice is -- Justice Breyer is -- is correct.\nThe degree that the surface has been given to the\npatentee, the patentee has total control of the surface --\nQUESTION: So and then -- if it's so, then at\nthis time what this amounted to what seemed to be giving\nthe land away -- it amounted to a lease or a right to use\na piece of land to grow crops. And that's all these great\ngiveaways were. They were simply a right to use land to\ngrow crops and nothing else.\nMR. SANSONETTI: Initially the answer to that --\nthat question is yes because if you look at section 3 of\nthe Pittman Act, it refers to an affidavit that must be\nsigned by the patentee coming onto the land, and that\naffidavit states that they are applying for this patent\nfor the purposes of reclamation and cultivation and it\nstates that they are not there as an agent for any other\ncorporation, mining company, or anything like that. They\nare there for the surface. Basically --\nQUESTION: All right. Then that whole argument\nwould be that's certainly a possible reading of the lease.\nThat's certainly a possible way to look at it, but it\nwould have come as a great surprise to Senator Pittman and\neverybody else at the time in the Interior Department and\nelsewhere. That's why, to make their argument, they say\nthat Western Nuclear was certainly wrong and therefore\nwhat we should do is limit it by turning everything on the\nword valuable. All right. That I think is their whole\nargument and you don't want to --\nMR. SANSONETTI: And -- and let me -- if I may\nshorten our own then, let me say that Congress, in looking\nat both the Stock-Raising Homestead Act and the Pittman\nAct, was basically saying to the patentees through the\nmineral reservation, you could have the surface of the\nland -- initially the thought was, of course, farming.\nQUESTION: Well, what if -- what if the surface\nhad -- what if the gravel was on the surface?\nMR. SANSONETTI: Okay. At -- the -- the gravel\non the surface that is usable for commercial purposes\nbelongs to the United States.\nQUESTION: So they didn't even get that part of\nthe surface.\nMR. SANSONETTI: If they wanted to use the sand\nand gravel as part of their surface operation as in the\nfarming where you want to gravel a road, when you turn it\ninto cement, as was done in this case -- the farmer Butler\nthat obtained the patent in 1940 used some of the sand and\ngravel to make concrete to provide patios, et cetera. As\nlong as it is linked to the purpose of the surface, it\nbelongs to the farmer, but if it's not, it belongs to the\nUnited States.\nQUESTION: Why is that? Why is that? Why is\nthat? Why is that? Is it the same with gold?\nMR. SANSONETTI: The -- the --\nQUESTION: So long as he uses the gold in his\nhouse, it's okay?\nMR. SANSONETTI: Well, I think that it --\nQUESTION: Or his teeth.\nQUESTION: Or his teeth, yes.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SANSONETTI: Or his teeth, yes.\nFor -- the long-term policy of the Department of\nInterior and the Bureau of Land Management, as is spelled\nout in great length in footnotes 3 and 14 of Western\nNuclear, is that it's always been okay for the owner of a\nsurface estate to go ahead and utilize a mineral so long\nas it is incident to the purposes --\nQUESTION: Can I ask --\nMR. SANSONETTI: -- ordinary farming.\nQUESTION: -- what -- what are his surface\nrights? Can -- can the -- can the Government do whatever\nit takes in order to get at these minerals?\nMR. SANSONETTI: The --\nQUESTION: I mean --\nMR. SANSONETTI: The answer is yes.\nQUESTION: -- he -- he supposedly has surface\nrights. Don't -- don't they have to preserve his surface\nrights when they do this?\nMR. SANSONETTI: The -- the answer is --\nQUESTION: But they can just go -- go in and rip\nup the whole -- the whole acreage in order to --\nMR. SANSONETTI: The -- the mineral estate is\nindeed dominant, Justice Scalia, and in fact, the Congress\nalready thought ahead about what would happen if the\nentire surface did need to get destroyed to go into a very\nvaluable mineral. And that is -- and that thought by\nCongress is included in sentences 3 and 4 of section 8 of\nthe Pittman Act where they make provisions for exactly\nwhat to do if you have to come in and locate a mineral or\ntoday you actually contract or sale your -- your sand and\ngravel.\nHere's what it said. It said that that person\nmay come on the land provided he shall not injure, damage,\nor destroy the permanent improvements of the entryman or\npatentee and shall be liable and shall compensate the\nentryman or patentee for all damages to the crops by\nreason of such prospecting. And that covers those that\nlocate under sentence 3, and under sentence 4 it covers\nthose that acquire a right to obtain the mineral through a\ncontract.\nQUESTION: Is it -- is it true? I -- I suppose\nthere's -- there's placer mining even for gold and I -- I\nguess in some instances for coal. But I -- I must tell\nyou my -- my assumption is that most mineral easements can\nbe exploited without undue disturbance of the surface. Do\nyou want to tell me that that's just wrong empirically,\nfactually? Other than gravel. Other than gravel.\nMR. SANSONETTI: The fact here, though -- I\nmean, the -- the answer is, is that some minerals can be\nextracted without much harm to the surface. A lot of them\ndo require it, though.\nQUESTION: How about coal? How about coal and\nhow about copper --\nMR. SANSONETTI: Of course --\nQUESTION: -- where you destroy huge areas of\nthe surface? Do you know?\nMR. SANSONETTI: You certainly do, Justice\nO'Connor. And -- and the fact is that that is exactly\nwhat was contemplated ahead of time when this particular\nact was passed. The minerals belong to the United States.\nAnd if it was copper and you needed a gigantic pit, so be\nit.\nIn this case, we have a gigantic pit. Let's not\n-- you know, if you take a look at the joint appendix\npicture 15, you actually see what we're talking about\nthere. This is not just a -- a surface operation. It's a\nhuge pit.\nQUESTION: Well, that's the whole problem\nbecause they say a person who went out to Nevada and\ninvested his time in this knew perfectly well that they\nweren't going to find copper. But if you had told him\nthat the Government might come in and take all the dirt\nout and take all the gravel out and take all the sand out,\nhe would have said this is ridiculous. I'm not going to\ngo out there and invest my time to -- to graze a cow when\nthe Government can come along and build a copper mine not\nfor copper but for dirt. I mean, really.\nSo that's -- that's why he says they've made\nthis historical distinction between something that has\nintrinsic value, a precious metal then or now, uranium or\ngold, and something that's widespread and commonly found,\ndirt, copper -- dirt or gravel or sand. And when you're\nin that second category, I'm sorry, you just can't dig\nthese -- these great big holes.\nMR. SANSONETTI: And that's -- that's what we\nhave here. We have got a gigantic hole.\nkeep in mind the difference between the dirt and the\ntopsoil which goes to the farming element of all this and\nthe sand and gravel which may be a humble mineral compared\nto gold or silver. Maybe the sand and gravel are the --\nthe poor stepchildren to brother gold and -- and sister\nsilver, but they're just as valuable as a member of the\nmineral family. Let me note that --\nQUESTION: May -- may I just interrupt to ask?\nI thought that you -- we weren't going to talk about dirt\nbecause dirt is part animal, part vegetable, so it's not\nmineral.\nMR. SANSONETTI: Right, but I brought that up\nbecause the question about topsoil. I wanted to make sure\nthat I was distinguishing what is part of the surface\nversus sand and gravel which is not part of the --\nQUESTION: How about clay? Is -- is clay like\ndirt or is clay like sand?\nMR. SANSONETTI: Clay can -- clay is like sand\nin there.\nBut the point is is that sand and gravel, as far\nback in the 1800's, much less at the point that I want to\nbring our -- the -- the Court's attention to, which is\n1919 where the Pittman Act is passed --\nQUESTION: I guess granite --\nMR. SANSONETTI:\nsorry.\nQUESTION: So granite -- I mean, I'm thinking of\ngranite. On our -- we have some granite. Somebody can\ncome in and dig up all the granite?\nMR. SANSONETTI: Yes, because actually this\nCourt in 1903 in the Soderberg case said gravel is a\nmineral. Sand and gravel is a mineral.\nQUESTION: And the -- and the same way with\ndecorative rocks which are a big thing in northern\nCalifornia now? People are selling decorative rocks off\ntheir -- off their property. That's -- that's a mineral.\nIt belongs to the Government under these patents.\nMR. SANSONETTI: Actually in that particular\ncase, you would look at quartz. If it was something that\nthey were using as part of their surface -- they may have\na greenhouse or whatever -- then obviously the Bureau of\nLand Management is not interested in -- in taking the\nperson's cactus or whatever.\nQUESTION: The -- the holding -- the holding in\nSoderberg was that granite outcroppings were reserved.\nThat -- it didn't talk about -- it didn't hold as to\ngravel, did it?\nMR. SANSONETTI: No, not -- not as to gravel. I\nsaid granite. He asked about granite. Granite.\nSoderberg said granite is a mineral.\nin Soderberg, though, that quoted that -- favorably that\ngravel was also a mineral.\nQUESTION: At what -- at what point did the\nDepartment of Interior take the position that you could\nget a mining claim under the mining act for sand and\ngravel claims?\nMR. SANSONETTI: As of 1872, as I understand it,\nJustice O'Connor.\nAnd -- and now to the 1919 part --\nQUESTION: You -- you think you can show that\npatented mining claims were allowed for sand and gravel on\npublic lands that early?\nMR. SANSONETTI: In -- in fact, with the passage\nof the 1872 Mining Act, that was the first opportunity\nunder that law for people go after sand and gravel. It\nwas not until 1947 with the passage of the Mineral\nMaterials Act that you could obtain sand and gravel either\nby locating it through the 1872 Mining Act or obtaining a\ncontract for lease. That changed. That contract for\nsale. Excuse me.\nAnd that changed in 1955 with the passage of the\nCommon Varietals Act where the only way you could obtain\nsand and gravel today -- well, ever since 1955 -- is by\nsale contract. You go to the Bureau of Land Management\nand you say you want 10,000 cubic yards of sand and\ngravel. You pay 35 cents or something like that that you\nbid to take each cubic yard out, and once that is out, of\ncourse, the 35 cents goes to the United States Government,\nTreasury, and the remainder, of course, goes for the sale\nof the sand and gravel.\nBut while it is valuable, obviously, in 1993\nwhen the petitioners were so interested in coming into the\nfarmer's shoes -- this is a mining operator BedRoc\nstepping into the shoes of a farmer, those that had gone\nahead and stayed on the surface of the land from 1940 to\n1993, now wanting to produce sand and gravel.\nQUESTION: Are you -- are you suggesting that\nbecause the grantee in this case was -- was a commercial\noperation, somehow the -- the value of the grant or the\nterms of the grant had changed?\nMR. SANSONETTI: Well, the -- the terms of the\ngrant did not change, but I think we have to keep in mind\nexactly what the purpose of the statute was. And here it\nwas Congress' intent to concurrently develop the surface\nof these lands and the mineral estates. The goal was to\nget new farmers to farm, new ranchers to ranch, while\nleaving the mineral estate to those that would be able to\nexploit that mineral and were after the mineral because\nthey wanted to be mineral operators, not because they came\non the land as farmers.\nThis was the problem with all the fraud that was\ngoing on under the old land classification system where\npeople would come onto the land saying this is non-\nmineral. I want it to be an agriculturalist, and then as\nsoon as they'd get the patent to everything, including the\nsurface and -- and the minerals, they were selling out to\nthe coal companies.\nAnd that's what brought out the 1906 reservation\nof the coal, and then you have the 1909 act which says the\npatentee gets everything but the coal. And then in 1916\nand 1919 we have these two acts that say, nope, we're now\ngoing, Congress says, to a split estate system where the\nsurface goes to the surface grantee, the patentee, and a\nmineral operator must come to the United States to get any\ntype of mineral.\nQUESTION: Let me get something clear about the\n-- the Department of Interior's position. You said that\never since 1872 they had taken the position that sand and\ngravel was -- was mineral. But isn't it the case that\nthey had taken that position only with respect to sand and\ngravel that was removable in -- in commercial quantities?\nMR. SANSONETTI: That is correct.\nQUESTION: Not all sand and gravel was minerals.\nMR. SANSONETTI: That -- that is correct. And\nthat's where the test of Western Nuclear comes in. If you\nwant to know whether something is a mineral or not, you\napply the test.\nQUESTION: Let's -- let's go back before Western\n-- I think Justice Scalia's question -- I don't think your\nanswer is consistent with what the Government did in the\nZimmerman case, the Department, which was questioned\nlater. But certainly at the time of Zimmerman, it -- it\nwas not a -- it was not regarded as a mineral, was it?\nMR. SANSONETTI: Well, Zimmerman in -- the\nZimmerman case was -- was the Department of the Interior\ncase that counsel has been referring to, Zimmerman, which\nwas in 1910, that said that sand and gravel did not equal\nmineral lands. So up until 1910, the question was, yes,\nit was -- it was a mineral. And the things -- things to\nnote about this.\nFirst of all, Zimmerman was specifically part of\nthe Western Nuclear case and is rejected at pages 45 and\n46 of that opinion.\nThe second thing is is that that opinion, issued\nby the Department of the Interior, was never tested in the\ncourts. It is certainly --\nQUESTION: Well, wait a minute. Does that mean\nan opinion -- say, an agency opinion -- has no value if\nit's never been tested in the courts?\nMR. SANSONETTI:\nthere's a difference between the Department of the\nInterior's ability to inform the Congress at the time that\nthis act passed in 1919 and their ability to bind the\nCongress. The solicitor's opinion is not binding on the\nCongress that that meant that sand and gravel fell out\nfrom the definition of valuable minerals in 1919,\nparticularly since in 1919 sand and gravel was the fifth\nlargest value of minerals produced in the United States\nthat were nonmetallic.\nQUESTION: Yes, and where -- where was that sand\nand gravel value concentrated? It was concentrated on the\neast coast because of World War I, wasn't it?\nMR. SANSONETTI: No. Actually as -- as you can\nsee in the joint appendix, pages 56 through 118, there are\na series of annual mineral reports that were utilized in\nboth of the -- the district court case and the appellate\ncourt case in -- in BedRoc, that spell out that by 1911,\nthere was already a national association of sand and\ngravel producers, including associations of State sand and\ngravel producers, in 14 different States.\nQUESTION: Where --\nMR. SANSONETTI: And -- and Nevada is included.\nQUESTION: And where -- and where else were the\n14 States? If you don't have it handy, don't --\nMR. SANSONETTI:\nand I would note, I believe, it is at joint appendix -- I\nbelieve the page is 56 that shows that sand used for the\nmaking of glass had already been discovered in Nevada as\nof 1918. So -- and --\nQUESTION: Well, that just -- that just proves\nthat sand and gravel in certain places is valuable.\nThat's conceded by the other side. Right? The issue was\nthat -- is whether sand in the Gobi Desert is -- is\nsomething that's worth anything. And the fact is that the\nInterior Department never took the position that all sand\nand gravel is -- is minerals under the Mineral Act until\nwhen?\nMR. SANSONETTI: The -- the --\nQUESTION: When was the first time it came up\nwith the notion that whether it's commercially extractable\nor not at -- you know, at a profit, it is all minerals\nunder -- under the mineral laws?\nMR. SANSONETTI: You could locate sand and\ngravel from 1872 up to 1910.\nQUESTION: You could locate it if it was\ncommercially valuable, yes.\nMR. SANSONETTI: That is correct.\nQUESTION: That's not the question I asked.\nWhen is it that the Department first came up with the\nposition that all sand and gravel, no matter where it is,\nis covered by the mining laws?\nMR. SANSONETTI: I don't know the exact answer\nto your question, but I can say in regard to this --\nQUESTION: Is it after -- is it after 1940?\nMR. SANSONETTI: It's before 1940 because in\n1919 the Department of the -- as of 1919, the Congress had\nstated that sand and gravel is a valuable mineral.\nQUESTION: Then how do you explain the 1956\nsolicitor letter -- opinion -- the DOI solicitor who said\nthat -- that there's a reservation only if the gravel had\na definite economic value because of the proximity of a\nmarket at the date of the patent?\nMR. SANSONETTI: It was that -- okay, first of\nall, the 1956 solicitor's opinion was also reviewed by\nthis Court in Western Nuclear. And the only portion of\nthe solicitor's opinion that was approved by this Court\nwas the finding that gravel was a mineral. The -- this\nCourt in --\nQUESTION: Well, did this Court disapprove of a\nportion that Justice Ginsburg just referred to? I don't\nremember.\nMR. SANSONETTI: It did not adopt it. In other\nwords, it was considered, but not adopted.\nQUESTION: Did it say it was wrong? Did it say\nthat was wrong?\nMR. SANSONETTI: It did not, but then that's\nbecause Western Nuclear didn't answer this precise\nquestion of site-specific.\nQUESTION: We're not talking for the moment\nabout what the Court adopted. We're talking about what\nthe Interior Department adopted. What is there in the\nInterior Department that would have contradicted its\nsolicitor's opinion?\nMR. SANSONETTI: Well, for one, it's the\npractice that has been followed since that time. Since\nsite-specific is what's being mentioned in the solicitor's\nopinion -- and frankly, it's an issue that related to an\nIndian reservation -- has absolutely no basis with the\nStock-Raising Homestead Act grants or the Pittman Act\ngrants. The statute at issue there related to an Indian\nreservation. It continued to grant United States control\nover all the minerals on that reservation, considered the\ntrust responsibility. There were other elements being\nconsidered there rather than whether or not site\nspecificity should be what the BLM follows all across the\nboard. Note that we are here --\nQUESTION: There's -- there's another -- there's\nanother piece from the Department of the Interior that Mr.\nMcCrum emphasized in addition to the 1956 opinion letter,\nand it was a heading or a sentence in the Western Nuclear\nbrief, in the SG's brief, stating that the reservation\nembraces only gravel deposits that are economically\nexploitable and would justify an entry under the 1872\nMining Act. So in Western Nuclear, according to Mr.\nMcCrum, that issue wasn't before the Court and the\nGovernment said, indeed, the issue is it has to be\neconomically exploitable at the time of the patent.\nMR. SANSONETTI: Your Honor, we're mixing up two\nthings. The 1872 Mining Act is an act that -- that tells\nyou how to obtain a mineral. The reservation we're\ntalking about today is describing what is covered by the\nmineral. Once you've got the what, then you can decide\nthe how, whether it's the 1872 act which has these deposit\nreferences and -- and the like, or whether something is\nsaleable under contract. That -- those are the hows.\nToday we're talking about the what, what is\ncovered by the reservation. And the Pittman Act House\nreport notes that the reservations in both the SRHA, the\nStock-Raising Homestead Act, and the Pittman Act are\nidentical.\nQUESTION: Well, but that -- that can't be\ncorrect, can it, because one uses the term valuable and\nthe other doesn't? And the House report certainly doesn't\nprevail over the statute.\nMR. SANSONETTI:\nstatute except let me come back to the question about the\ntwo words being -- the two phrases being different because\nsection 8 of the bill -- again, Pittman was passed after\nthe Stock-Raising Homestead Act, and the actual quote is\nthat section 8 of the Pittman Act contains the same\nreservations of minerals which was passed by Congress in\nthe Stock-Raising Homestead Act.\nNow --\nQUESTION: Well, that's not a quote from the\nstatute. That's a quote from the report.\nMR. SANSONETTI: And now as to the quotes from\nthe statute.\nQUESTION: Will you -- will you answer my\nquestion?\nMR. SANSONETTI: The answer is yes.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. SANSONETTI: Okay. Now as to the actual\nstatutes. In the Stock-Raising Homestead Act, it is all\nthe coal and other minerals. That's section 9. In\nsection 8 of the Pittman Act, it is all the coal and other\nvaluable minerals.\nQUESTION: Right. So -- so can I -- can you\ndeal with this --\nMR. SANSONETTI: Yes.\nQUESTION:\nmind? Okay? All right.\nYou wanted to finish what you were saying.\nMR. SANSONETTI: If -- if I may, the position of\nthe United States is that those two phrases, valuable\nminerals and minerals, are synonymous. The word valuable\ndefinitely has a meaning. That meaning was set out in\nWestern Nuclear as being used for commercial purposes. So\nused for commercial purposes, the concept of value is\ndefinitely part of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act, and\nconsequently, it means the mineral must be valuable.\nIn Pittman, you've got again the exact same\nlanguage of section 8 and section 9 with the addition of\nthe word valuable. It appears eight times in both of --\nof those sections, and it is our -- our position then that\nthey are interchangeable. Minerals sometimes, valuable\nmineral other times. So it's a distinction without a\ndifference and valuable is definitely not a word of\nsurplus.\nQUESTION: Okay. What's bothering me in the\nback of my mind, assuming all the opinion letters and\neverything are sort of a wash, is that we don't ranch all\n-- as much as we used to and we don't farm as much as we\nused to. And therefore, what's really at stake is the\nability to transfer title.\nAnd once I begin to think in that way, I think\nthat whoever might want to sell or buy some of this land,\nwhich now might be used for a city or a town or who knows\nwhat, might think to himself, well, I can deal with the\nreservation of, let's say, a specific precious mineral\nright like gold or even tungsten or even uranium. But if\nthere's a possibility here that the Government can come in\nand start digging, because the mixture of organic only\ngoes down about 6 inches, and if everything below that 6\ninches potentially belongs to the Government, and the\nGovernment can come in and tear up even that 6 inches to\nlook for rocks or look for sand or look for gravel or\ngranite or all that stuff, which is undoubtedly there, I\njust don't know what I'm getting into. And therefore, I\nwould be pretty reluctant to buy this piece of land, or at\nleast not for much of a price.\nNow, it's that kind of uncertainty in land\ntransfer title that is coming on 100 years after the event\nthat's worrying me. So I would like you to reply and tell\nme what you think of that.\nMR. SANSONETTI: Let -- let me try it in -- in\nthis fashion because we're talking about expectations here\nand what the patentee, the surface owner, is obtaining and\nhow it passes that on to successors.\nThe United States was saying through the\nCongress through both of these acts that the mineral --\nthrough the mineral reservations that you, the patentee,\ncan come onto the surface of this land, use it as you\nwill. We, the citizens of the United States, keep\nanything that may be found on or underneath that land that\nhas mineral value. The patentee gets to use the surface\nas his benefit of the bargain and should not expect\nanything else. If there are windfalls -- if there are\nwindfalls of valuable minerals that no one knew were under\nthese lands in Nevada, if any, they should belong to the\ncitizens of the United States and --\nQUESTION: Most of the States that have ruled on\nthis subject -- most of the State courts that have ruled\non this subject, have come out the other way from Western\nNuclear. Do they have a different perspective or\ndifferent concerns?\nMR. SANSONETTI: They -- they do -- they do\nbecause there's no congressional mandate in those -- in\nthose State court cases. Those State court cases\ninvariably have situations where the reservations may or\nmay not be applied by the Secretary of the Interior, in\nreference to the Hess case for instance.\nQUESTION: No, but the practical problems and\nthe -- and -- and the likely expectations and\nunderstanding of the purchasers would be the same.\nMR. SANSONETTI:\nexcept in our instance, they're much more clearly laid out\nbecause once that affidavit is signed under section 3,\nthen you have the person coming onto the land\ncontemplating cultivation. They are signing an affidavit\nsaying they want the free land, and it's free land. For\n20 acres of crops, they get up to 640 acres of free land.\nAnd they get the appreciation of that land. This\nparticular plot happens to be just north of Las Vegas. If\nit appreciates --\nQUESTION: If they find -- if they find water.\nThey have to come in --\nMR. SANSONETTI: They have to --\nQUESTION: -- and expend a certain amount of\nmoney --\nMR. SANSONETTI: Yes, they did.\nQUESTION: -- considerable money sometimes, to\nfind water. And if they find it, then they have the right\nto -- to farm. And, you know, I don't think that's a --\nsuch a terrific deal if they can be just dug out of their\n-- of their homestead by the Government.\nMR. SANSONETTI: But the fact is is at the point\nwhere they did find water, they applied for the patent.\nThey get their 640 acres. In this case it was 560. They\nacknowledge that they are getting this free land for\ncrops.\nthat had been grown that got them the opportunity to file\ntheir final certificate and obtain that patent.\nNow, remember, if this land appreciates, they\nget the benefit of that bargain, the same way as if the\nUnited States happens to find that there is a valuable\nmineral underneath, they happen to benefit from it. This\ncould be a golf course or a WalMart or anything in a few\nyears north of Las Vegas.\nQUESTION: If -- if the --\nMR. SANSONETTI: The United States is not asking\nfor that appreciation.\nQUESTION: If the property owner had exported --\ntransported the water to Las Vegas for a municipal water\nsupply, would that be consistent with reclamation?\nMR. SANSONETTI: Any -- as I understand it, that\nunder Nevada State law, the water actually that was found\nby Farmer Butler in this case is -- is dealt with by the\nNevada State water engineer. So long as he uses it for\nbeneficial uses, the permission to take it off premises or\non premises has nothing to do with this reservation. It\nhas to do with Farmer Butler and Nevada State law.\nBut I would like to note a couple quick things\nin regard to the bad consequences of a site-specific test\nbecause it does place the ownership of other minerals into\ndoubt.\nwith on one hand and sand and gravel or some ubiquitous\ncommon gravel over here. What happens? What's the test\nthen for things like trona or bentonite or limestone or\ndolomite or any other thing. You mentioned uranium.\nUranium was used for watch dials way back in 1919, but of\ncourse, we now see it has a much more important purpose\ntoday.\nQUESTION: The -- the test, as I understand it,\nwould be whether it was commercially worthwhile to extract\nit and transport it to wherever you'd have to take it to\nuse it.\nMR. SANSONETTI: Ah, and if it was, it would be\na mineral reserved to the United States. But if the site-\nspecific test is put into place, imagine then the\npractical difficulties in trying to show that from the\nBureau of Land Management's point of view going back in\ntime --\nQUESTION: No, no. I mean, the -- the Bureau\nhas always had a -- a doctrine of inherently valuable\nminerals, gold and silver. You don't have to show that it\ncan be extracted at a commercial profit. And benthamite\nor kryptonite, which Superman uses --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- whatever you want, all you have to\ndo is say that that is an inherently valuable mineral.\nMR. SANSONETTI: Well, to the extent that\nthere's any doubt on -- on the Court about whether or not\ngravel is a mineral reserved to the United States in the\nPittman Act reservation, we feel it should be resolved in\nfavor of the Government due to the old canon of\nconstruction that says that about the scope of land grants\nare construed favorably to the Government.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Sansonetti.\nMr. McCrum, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF R. TIMOTHY McCRUM\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. McCRUM: Thank you.\nOne point that I'd like to make as clear as I\npossibly could is that sand and gravel was not locatable\nunder the Mining Law from 1872 onward. It -- it -- the\nInterior Department was as clear as could be in published\ndecisions that common material like sand and gravel and\nclay were not subject to the 1872 Mining Law, not within\nthe class of valuable minerals. The -- the first\npublished decision we see on this is in the 1880's and we\nsee a repeated line of cases from 1901 through 1919.\nThey're all cited in our opening brief. We really\nshouldn't have an issue about that.\nIt was not until 1929 --\nQUESTION: Well, your opponent flatly disagrees\nwith you, doesn't he, on that?\nMR. McCRUM: I have great respect for my\nopponent, Mr. Sansonetti, but I -- I think that this point\nthat I'm making is -- is as clear as could be in the\nrecord.\nAnd the Zimmerman case is not an isolated case.\nIt's merely a case in 1910 that is stating this very\nexplicitly in the case of sand and gravel that this was\nactually the general understanding and that the Department\nwas not even receiving applications for sand and gravel\nmining claims because this was so well known.\nIt was not until 1929 in the Layman v. Ellis\ndecision where the Department changed that rule, 10 years\nafter the Pittman Act in this case. Then it was\ndetermined on a site-specific basis. That's the site-\nspecific base -- basis argument that we are putting\nforward here, which then was adopted in the 1956\nsolicitor's opinion in the context of mineral\nreservations.\nThere was some reference to the Soderberg case\nof this Court in 1903. That involved valuable granite\nbuilding stone of the type that we see here in the\nJefferson Memorial and around this city. Not -- it was\nnot a surprising ruling when this Court upheld the\nposition of the Interior Department patent that valuable\ngranite could be subject to the Mining Law within the\nclass of valuable minerals.\nBy then, in 1897, in the Pacific Coast Marble\ncase, the Interior Department had already ruled that\nmarble was a valuable mineral, which is an eminently sound\nruling looking at the marble in this Court building, which\nis quite different from common sand and gravel.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. McCrum.\n"
