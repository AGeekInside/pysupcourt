        "content": "(10:53 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in No. 02-1684, Michael Yarborough v. Michael\nAlvarado.\nMs. Chuang.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DEBORAH J. CHUANG\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. CHUANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFor nearly 4 decades, the ultimate inquiry as to\nwhether a person is in custody is whether there is formal\narrest or restraint in freedom of movement to the degree\nassociated with formal arrest.\nThe Ninth Circuit acknowledged that the State\ncourt had identified the correct legal standard for\ndetermining custody, that no Supreme Court case had\naddressed whether age and experience needed to be\nconsidered for that determination, and that it was\nborrowing legal principles from another area of\njurisprudence. Yet, it held that it was objectively\nunreasonable for the State court to have abstained from\ninnovating such a new role.\nThis case illustrates why Federal habeas relief\ncannot be granted under 28 U.S.C., section 2254(d), when a\nState court decision does not extend Supreme Court\nprecedent to a new context. Such relief is incompatible\nwith the provisions of section 2254(d) for three reasons.\nFirst, to require a State court to extrapolate\nSupreme Court precedents from the voluntariness context to\nthe custody context cannot be fairly characterized as\napplying this Court's custody precedents.\nQUESTION: Ms. Chuang, there are two questions\npresented in the petition for certiorari. One is what I\ntook it to be -- is the rule that the Ninth Circuit\nannounced correct under our precedents, and the second,\nunder AEDPA, was it objectively unreasonable for the State\ncourt to rule otherwise. Are you going to address both\nthose questions?\nMS. CHUANG: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMS. CHUANG: The Ninth Circuit fundamentally\nchanged the rule for resolving custody claims by juveniles\nand, second, Federal law as determined by the Supreme\nCourt refers -- is limited to the Supreme Court's\nholdings. The Ninth Circuit substituted its holding for\nthat of this Court when it recognized that this Court had\nnever held so in the custody context.\nAnd third, to say that an extension of Supreme\nCourt precedent to a new context is clearly established\nlaw would define clearly established at such a high --\nQUESTION: But how is it a new context? I mean,\nthe -- the rule was how a reasonable man in the suspect's\nposition would have understood his situation. So is it\nnew to say you -- I mean, it might be new if in fact there\nwas blind person and the agent who was holding him wrote\non a note, you are free to leave. You know, he can't read\nit. Now, would you need a new, special Supreme Court case\nto say that's ridiculous?\nMS. CHUANG: No, Your Honor. You -- you would\nnot. What --\nQUESTION: Then why do you need a new, special\nSupreme Court to say a very young person might feel very\ndifferently about whether he's in custody from a person\nwho's a -- not -- not a child and not a minor?\nMS. CHUANG: Well, because this Court's\nprecedence as for custody determination has only\nconsidered the circumstances encountered by the person --\nQUESTION: Well, we haven't considered blind\npeople either. We haven't considered deaf people whom\nsomeone might whisper, you're free to go. I mean, the\npoint is it's so obvious that -- that being a child or a\njuvenile would make a difference, that you don't have to\nwrite it in all the cases. So my question is, why isn't\nthat obvious?\nMS. CHUANG: I believe that the answer is that\nthe ultimate inquiry for custody determinations is whether\nthere is a formal arrest or restraint in freedom of\nmovement.\nQUESTION: How old was the respondent in this\ncase? 17-and-a-half, wasn't he?\nMS. CHUANG: Yes, Your Honor. He was 17-and-a-\nhalf years old during the interview.\nQUESTION: And I suppose, in the view of the\nNinth Circuit, he would have had to be treated quite\ndifferently if he were 6 months older, if he were 18.\nMS. CHUANG: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I thought --\nQUESTION: What -- what if he were 6? Would --\nwould you acknowledge that -- that that factor should be\ntaken into account?\nMS. CHUANG: No, Your Honor, I don't believe\nthat a 6-year-old -- that age and experience should be\nconsidered because the test -- the ultimate inquiry is\nwhether there is a formal arrest or restraint in freedom\nof movement.\nQUESTION: No, but that depends upon what a\nreasonable person in the circumstances would understand to\nbe his situation whether a reasonable person would believe\nhe was being detained. Isn't that the test? So, I mean,\nit doesn't -- it doesn't help to simply say that, you\nknow, the question is whether there's an arrest. Yes,\nthere is. That is the question.\nBut our standard for whether there has been an\narrest is what would a reasonable person believe. Would\nhe believe he was arrested? Which gets you right back\ninto the determination of what a person would believe.\nNow, would we take into account the fact that\nsomebody is 6 years old?\nMS. CHUANG: We don't deny that a 6-year-old\nwould certainly be more vulnerable to overall coercion.\nYet, that is -- overall coercion is addressed by the\nvoluntariness test and really the custody question is only\nconcerned with one aspect of coercion and that is custody.\nAnd to --\nQUESTION: Why -- why isn't it? Look, I'm not\n-- I guess let me try again because I can understand you'd\nsay there's only 6 months difference here. So in this\ncase, being a juvenile didn't matter. But that's not what\nyou're talking about.\nYou're talking about the standard that says the\nnature of a person as a child or an adult is something\nthat can make a difference. All right? To custody. You\nagreed being blind could make a difference to custody.\nYou agree being deaf could make a difference to custody.\nWhy can't being a child in principle make a difference to\ncustody? That's the question. And it has only to do with\nwhether the first part of your argument, not the second.\nMS. CHUANG: Well, Your Honor, I suppose that a\nblind person, if you hand the blind person a note saying,\nyou are free to leave, would not -- you could not use that\nnote as an indication that he was free to leave. You\ncouldn't use that as a circumstance to show that he was\nfree to leave.\nQUESTION: Well, isn't what you're objecting to\nin the Ninth Circuit's decision the idea that there is\nsome sort of a bright line cutoff date when the person\nturns 18? You don't deny that a person 6 -- 6 years old\nwould be treated differently than a 17-year-old, I\nsuppose, for determining the objective test.\nMS. CHUANG: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Is that -- I thought you said age is\nirrelevant.\nMS. CHUANG: Yes.\nQUESTION: That age is -- you -- you said age is\nirrelevant to the custody determination.\nMS. CHUANG: That's correct. Age --\nQUESTION: Other things like language is --\nlanguage is relevant if the person doesn't -- is not\nconversant with English.\nMS. CHUANG: Language might not be relevant,\nYour Honor, because -- or -- or it might relevant because\nif the person did not understand English and the officer\nsaid, you are free to leave, that is -- that is a\ncircumstance that the person encountered that is within\nthe officer's control that the -- and the person doesn't\nunderstand English, that would be something that could not\nbe relied upon later on to show that he was -- he\nunderstood that he was free to leave. But then again,\nthat might not mean that he could use it to show that he\nwas in custody as well.\nQUESTION: Let -- let me ask you about two facts\nin -- in this particular case. The first one is this.\nAnd correct me if I'm wrong.\nWhen the -- when the sheriff's department wanted\nto question this -- this young man, they went to his\nparents and the parents said, in effect, yes, we will --\nwe will bring him down or take him down with us, and they\ntook him to the station, so that as I understand it, the\nsheriff's department didn't ask him to make a choice as to\nwhether they would go down to the headquarters and talk\nwith him. The parents did that.\nThe second fact I want you to comment on is that\nwhen they got down there, the parents said, in the boy's\nhearing, can't we go in with him or can we go in with him?\nThey -- they made it clear that they would like to go into\nthis interrogation. And the deputy sheriff said no, kept\nthem out. The sheriff and the boy disappeared.\nAre those two facts relevant in making the\ndetermination of whether he would reasonably understand\nthat he was being under -- held under conditions\nequivalent to a formal arrest?\nMS. CHUANG: No, Your Honor, I don't believe\nthey are relevant.\nQUESTION: Why -- why not? Why not?\nMS. CHUANG: Because once -- again, if his -- if\nhis parents were asked for permission to interview, the\ndetective had asked the parents for permission to\ninterview him, and his parents said yes, the meaning of\nthat question was that he could have said no, and --\nQUESTION: Wait a minute. You just lost me.\nHow -- how is it that he could have said no?\nMS. CHUANG: He could have refused to have\nsubmitted to the interview, and there's no indication in\nthe record --\nQUESTION: Well, but he -- but he -- he didn't.\nHis parents said, yes, you can interview him. We will\nbring him down, and the boy came along. That's all we\nknow.\nMS. CHUANG: That's correct, Your Honor. That's\n-- that's what we know.\nQUESTION: And why is that? And that is\nirrelevant you say because the boy might have said, well,\nI won't go?\nMS. CHUANG: That -- yes, Your Honor. It's --\nQUESTION: You don't know whether he would have\nfelt free to say that or not, do you? Do we have anything\nin the record on that?\nMS. CHUANG: There's no indication one way or\nthe other. But there was no indication that he was not\nvoluntarily being interviewed.\nQUESTION: Well, there is an indication. I -- I\nmean, that's what I'm trying to get at. The -- the\nindication is that he was taken down to the station house\nby his parents. He didn't make the choice. And when they\ngot down there, the parents, who wanted to be present\nduring the interrogation, were told that they couldn't.\nThe -- the -- it seems to me that the objective\nappearance of -- of these two facts is, number one, the\nboy appears to be under the control of his parents and his\nparents appear to be under the control of the sheriff's\ndepartment when they get down to headquarters. And on\nthose two facts, I would think it would be difficult --\nstanding alone, those two facts, it would be difficult to\ninfer that this boy would have felt that he was free to\nturn around and -- and walk out of the interview and\nleave. And -- and I don't understand why those facts are\nnot relevant.\nMS. CHUANG: Well, Your Honor, I -- I -- there's\nno indication, though, that he was at the station\ninvoluntarily. Certainly he came with his parents, but --\nQUESTION: Well, the indication is that his\nparents brought him. That's all we know.\nMS. CHUANG: Well, Your Honor, Mr. Alvarado --\nit indicated in the record that Mr. Alvarado lived at home\nwith his parents and that he did not have a car.\nQUESTION: He's a minor, isn't he?\nMS. CHUANG: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION:\nhim to, doesn't he? Isn't that what being in the status\nof -- of a minor means, that if your parents tell you stay\nat home, you're grounded, you're grounded? Isn't that\nessentially the disability of being a minor?\nSo I guess maybe the proper inquiry is whether\nhis parents thought that they could let him leave if they\nwanted to. Either that's the proper inquiry or perhaps no\nminor can be interrogated in -- in a police station\nbecause it always requires the consent of the parents, and\nwhen the parents tells him, you know, you go be\ninterrogated, he thinks he can't leave. It's a terrible\nproblem, isn't it?\nMS. CHUANG: Well, Your Honor, I -- I believe\nthat custody by -- custody in the sense of a parental and\njuvenile situation is not the same as custody as you are\nunder formal arrest or restrained in freedom of movement\nto the same degree --\nQUESTION: Well, then that's the whole point.\nThat's why I think Justice Souter asked that question,\nsaying, look, you're -- you're used to your parents\ntelling you what to do and maybe even sometimes you do it.\nAll right?\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: So the parents bring them down --\nbring him down. He doesn't think he has any choice. He\nthen asks Ms. Comstock, I guess, who was the arresting\nofficer that brought him in there, can I take my parents\nin this room. The parents say we want to go in the room.\nAnd the policewoman -- I think it was a woman, wasn't it?\nI think she said no. And they, who desperately -- or\ncertainly want to get into the room, can't. So he's\nsitting there and that, together with all the other things\nthat are going on -- and there are quite a few -- would\nlead a reasonable person, who's used to being under the --\nthe rule of his parents, to think, my goodness, this\npolice woman controls the situation. Of course, I have to\ndo what she says, and of course, I can't leave until, as\nshe said, I've finished answering the question and she can\n-- tells me I can leave. I'm in custody. Now, maybe an\nadult wouldn't be thinking that. Maybe he would. But\nthat's a reasonable question.\nBut our standard here is, you know, not whether\nthey were right in the State but whether they were\nreasonable. But a juvenile certainly would be thinking\nthat. That's -- that's I think what the point is.\nNow, I'd like to hear sort of a full-blown\nresponse to that.\nMS. CHUANG: Yes, Your Honor. Well, first a --\nQUESTION: Just as full-blown as the question.\nQUESTION:\n(Laughter.)\nMS. CHUANG: Yes, Your Honor.\nA juvenile -- unless the Court is willing to say\nthat the parents in this case operated as agents of law\nenforcement by bringing him into the sheriff's station and\nthat when the officer -- the detective had asked him if he\n-- if the parents would give permission, that somehow that\nreally wasn't an option that the detective was giving, Mr.\nAlvarado was not in custody.\nQUESTION: What I -- what I can't understand --\nand this was Justice Souter's question. Forget how these\nfactors play out one way or the other. Are these factors\n-- the circumstance that the parents brought the juvenile\nto the station; two, that the parents wanted to go in or\nasked someone -- asked to go in and they couldn't -- are\nthose objective factors that the Court can consider in the\ncustody determination?\nMS. CHUANG: No, Your Honor, because --\nQUESTION: So -- so if -- if the defense counsel\nbring this up, the judge rules that it's to be excluded.\nIt's irrelevant.\nMS. CHUANG: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMS. CHUANG: Because as this Court alluded to in\nColorado v. Connolly what the Fifth Amendment is concerned\nwith is government coercion, and to the extent that the\nparents brought Mr. Alvarado to the station, that is not\ngovernment coercion.\nAnd as far as the parents not being allowed in\nthe interview room, there -- Mr. Alvarado actually did not\npresent any evidence that his parents were not permitted\ninto the interview room. And indeed, the interview room\ndoor was open, as indicated at joint appendix page 150.\nQUESTION: Well, would yo just correct me on the\nfacts? I thought the -- the record indicated that the\nparents had asked to go in, and as Justice Breyer pointed\nout, that in fact the boy at one point said, you know, do\nI have to go alone? Isn't anybody coming with me? Are --\nare -- is there testimony to that effect in the record?\nMS. CHUANG: No, Your Honor. There is no\ntestimony to that. Indeed, it was only argued by his\nattorney, but his attorney relied upon the transcript of\nthe interview.\nQUESTION: This was at the suppression hearing.\nMS. CHUANG: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMS. CHUANG: And --\nQUESTION: Did -- did the State object to those\nfacts as being untrue and not in evidence?\nMS. CHUANG:\nHonor. The State did not, but the -- the State was\nrelying on the fact that it was the interview transcript\nthat Mr. Alvarado's counsel was using, and indeed, at the\ntrial when Mr. Alvarado testified, he never stated that he\nasked for his parents to be in there, and he had testified\nthat he didn't feel coerced or --\nQUESTION: May I --\nQUESTION: Where -- where did this fact come\nfrom? It's in the interview transcript?\nMS. CHUANG: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: Where did this fact or factoid come\nfrom that -- you know, that -- that his parents wanted to\ngo in but they were told they couldn't? Where did it come\nfrom?\nMS. CHUANG: His -- it came from his attorney's\nargument during the suppression hearing.\nQUESTION: It's not in any evidence.\nMS. CHUANG: No, Your Honor. It's not in any\nevidence. And to say that -- to require the State court\nto extrapolate from this Court's voluntariness precedents\nthat predated Miranda to decide what types of individual\ncharacteristics needed to be considered for a Miranda\ncustody, is not what section 2254(d) requires. Section\n2254(d) --\nQUESTION:\nI thought you conceded that if he were only 6 years old,\nthat would be relevant. And the question presented is\nwhether age is ever relevant. What -- what is your\nposition exactly? Is it it's okay to consider it if he's\n6 but not if he's 17-and-a-half?\nMS. CHUANG: No. Actually, Your Honor, it --\nyet -- we -- my position is that a 6-year-old age would\nstill be irrelevant. It might be relevant for the\nvoluntariness as to overall coercion.\nQUESTION: But not as to whether he thinks he's\nfree to leave.\nMS. CHUANG: That's correct. The California\ncourt of --\nQUESTION: Do you know any other category where\nage is ever and always irrelevant, any other category in\nthe law?\nMS. CHUANG: Yes, Your Honor. In the Fourth\nAmendment seizure area, this Court has held that it's a\nreasonable person, and indeed in Hodari D. v. California,\nthis Court used the -- the reasonable person standard\nwithout considering age. While this Court did mention age\nin the Kaupp case, which was cited by Mr. Alvarado, it's\nuncertain to what degree age actually was relevant for the\nseizure question, whether a person felt free to leave.\nA better reading of Kaupp is that it was -- the\nCourt may have mentioned the Mr. -- the age of the\ndefendant in that case for the voluntariness of\naccompanying the officers to the station, as this Court\nindicated with a citation of Royer v. -- Royer and also\nSchneckloth. Both of those cases indicate that age does\ngo to the voluntariness of consenting to go with officers.\nThe California Court of Appeal in this case\nidentified the correct standard for making a custody\ndetermination, and it engaged in a reasonable application\nof existing custody precedent. The Ninth Circuit\nrecognized no Supreme Court case has required age and\nexperience to --\nQUESTION: Thank -- thank you, Ms. Chuang.\nMS. CHUANG: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Elwood, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. ELWOOD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Ninth Circuit erred when it held that a\njuvenile's age and experience must be considered in\ndetermining whether or not he is in custody for purposes\nof the Miranda test.\nQUESTION:\nparents brought the person to the station and that they\nwere -- requested to be in the room it -- are -- are not\nrelevant to the custody determination?\nMR. ELWOOD: I think that they can be considered\nby the court in determining the -- the circumstances\nsurrounding the interrogation, just as in Oregon v.\nMathiason they considered the fact the -- the person came\nto the station on his own power.\nQUESTION: So that they are relevant to the\nobjective inquiry whether or not a reasonable person\nthought he was under custody in these circumstances.\nMR. ELWOOD: I think that they are facts that\ncan be considered by a -- under the reasonable person\nstandard to determine whether a reasonable person would\nhave felt that he was not free to leave or rather that he\nwas under formal arrest at that point.\nQUESTION: So you disagree with the State on\nthat point.\nMR. ELWOOD: I -- I think it's a -- it's a\nslightly different viewpoint because I -- I don't think\nthat's what the Ninth Circuit was getting at. What the\nNinth Circuit was basically saying is that you don't\nemploy the reasonable person standard. You, rather,\nemploy a reasonable juvenile standard, and you view all\nthe circumstances differently.\nI think, though, that you can consider the fact\nthat he -- particularly the alleged fact that he -- his\nparents were excluded from the interview in determining\nwhat a reasonable person would have felt from that.\nUnfortunately, because it was simply argued by his\nattorney at the suppression hearing and there were no\nfindings on it, we don't know exactly how that happened.\nIf --\nQUESTION: But it is true there was testimony on\nit, is it not?\nMR. ELWOOD: I --\nQUESTION: The -- the -- page 2 of the red brief\ngives transcript cites for -- as Michael -- his parents\nasked if they could come in and Detective Comstock refused\nto do it.\nMR. ELWOOD: I -- I -- I don't -- unfortunately,\nI -- I left my transcript at my seat, but it may be that\nthe defendant testified at the trial itself that that is\nwhat occurred.\nQUESTION: J.A. 49 --\nMR. ELWOOD: In any event, we don't have any\nfindings from the State court about what exactly\ntranspired. I think that if the --\nQUESTION: But your view is different from your\ncolleague. She said there was nothing in the record. You\nsay there are just no findings on it.\nMR. ELWOOD: That's correct, that there are no\nfindings on it and that we have the lawyer's assertion and\nwe may have -- I -- I don't recall -- the defendant's own\ntestimony at the -- the trial itself.\nBut in any event, our point with respect to the\nexclusion is you have to look at what -- how a reasonable\nperson would view that, not necessarily a reasonable\njuvenile, but a reasonable person. And if the --\nQUESTION: But do you think the child whose\nparents were denied permission to come into the room would\ndraw any inference about whether he could leave at --\nanytime he wanted to?\nMR. ELWOOD: Again, I think it depends on how it\nwas put because if they just say, no, you may not come in,\nI think a reasonable person could conclude from that that\nthey're exercising control over the interrogation and that\nthey -- that might extend to whether or not he's free to\ngo. However, if it -- the officer says something more\nalong the lines of, no, we'd rather you not because he'll\n-- he'll be able to be more candid if there's no one else\nin there with you, I think that that would express a very\ndifferent --\nQUESTION: Do you think it would make a\ndifference in that inquiry if the person being\ninterrogated was 35 years old, on the one hand, and 10\nyears old on the other hand?\nMR. ELWOOD: I think that it doesn't make a\nlegal difference for Miranda purposes, and that's our\nbasic argument, is that Miranda doesn't -- didn't develop\na rule that provides protection tailored for the specific\ncircumstances of -- of the person who's under\ninterrogation. Rather, it's a uniform rule that provides\nthe same level of protection for all people, regardless of\nwhether they're very experienced of inexperienced. And I\nthink --\nQUESTION: And you're telling me that the 35-\nyear-old example and the 10-year-old example should be\ntreated precisely the same.\nMR. ELWOOD: I think that they should be treated\nthe same for purposes of the Miranda prophylactic rule.\nThey should not be treated differently for voluntariness.\nQUESTION: For the purposes of determining\nwhether he thinks he's in custody.\nMR. ELWOOD: Yes, that is correct. And I think\nthat traditionally what the Court has done is it has\nviewed the circumstances that you look to, the totality of\nthe circumstances, as being external to the reasonable\nperson. I think that's the inference you get from\nThompson v. Keohane.\nQUESTION: A person of borderline competency who\ndoesn't speak the language is -- we don't consider that\na --\nMR. ELWOOD: You don't consider that for\npurposes of the -- of the altering the reasonable person\nview. You don't say a reasonable person of borderline\ncompetency. You can, I think, consider it for different\npurposes like in Justice Breyer's example of the blind\nperson. One of the very important things to figure out\nbefore you apply the reasonable person standard and our\nbasic objection to the Ninth Circuit's rule is it altered\nthe reasonable person standard and said it's a reasonable\njuvenile standard when you're determining --\nQUESTION: All right. So your point is instead\nof having a standard of a reasonable blind person, you\nhave a standard of a reasonable person and one -- in the\ncircumstances and one of the circumstances is that he's\nblind.\nMR. ELWOOD: But one of the reasonable under the\ncircumstances --\nQUESTION: Is that the point?\nMR. ELWOOD: It's not quite right, but it's\ngetting there.\nQUESTION: No. And -- and then you say it so\nit's right.\nMR. ELWOOD: The point is that one -- one of the\nimportant factors to determine when you're figuring out\nwhat the totality of the circumstances is that you apply\nthe reasonable person test to is what police officers told\nthe person about his freedom to leave. And if you --\nQUESTION: I understand all that. I'm trying to\nget what your objection is to the standard. I'm not\ntalking about this case now. And is the right way to say\nit that we don't apply a reasonable blind person test, we\napply a reasonable person test in the circumstances, and\none of the circumstances is that he's blind. Now, you\nsaid, no, that isn't the right way. Then what is the\nright way?\nMR. ELWOOD: I -- I think that you can consider\n-- I think we might be saying basically the same thing but\njust slightly different --\nQUESTION: I want you to say it --\nMR. ELWOOD: I'm trying to get --\nQUESTION: -- so that I understand what your\nstatement is.\nMR. ELWOOD: Is that the -- is the -- is that\nthe person -- you can consider what the police officer\ncommunicated to them, and when you're figuring out what\nthe police officer communicated to them, the police\nofficer doesn't get to, you know, pretend that a blind\nperson can see. They have to take into consideration that\nwhen you hand them a written notice, they're not going to\nsee it, just as though -- just as if you whispered it to\nthem in a voice too low for them to hear. The basic point\nis that you didn't communicate anything to them.\nAnd our objection to the Ninth Circuit's\nstandard is they're trying to make you view the entire\nworld through the viewpoint of a reasonable juvenile,\nwhich means that we're not talking about whether or not\nthe person was unable to leave the room when they wanted\nto because they couldn't reach the doorknob because they\nwere short. The point is that we're trying to infer\nsomething about the way they view the entire world because\nthey're a juvenile. Because they're a juvenile, they're\nmore likely to be submissive to authority. Because\nthey're a juvenile, they're more likely to feel that --\nthat anything that the police officer says is a command.\nAnd I think that it's very different to adopt a\nwhole different world view thing versus simply asking\npolice officers to take notice of things that are\nobjectively very plain or rather observable and very\nplain, such as a blind person cannot see the warning that\nyou give him. And I think that that is the basic\ndifference between what is permissible under the\nreasonable person test, as it has always been applied, and\nthe Ninth Circuit's innovation of it.\nNow --\nQUESTION: On -- on your view of this case, is\nit -- suppose we say, all right, reasonable person doesn't\nmean 16. Could -- would a remand be appropriate to view\nthe totality of the circumstances and see if they add up\nto in custody using the reasonable person standard?\nMR. ELWOOD: Justice Ginsburg, I think that a\nremand isn't necessary because I think that what the State\ncourt of appeals did is approximately right, or at least\nit's within the range of reason. So, no, I don't think\nthat you would need to do that.\nNow, if I could get back to one -- one of the\nquestions that Justice Scalia asked, which was do we apply\nthe same standard for a 6-year-old. And although it may\nseem kind of intuitively wrong, yes, we would apply the\nsame reasonable person standard that we would to anybody\nelse, with the point being that it's a very difficult\nthing to require police officers not only to know that a\n6-year-old is more vulnerable, but also to know exactly\nwhere along the continuum of custody versus non-custody\nthat -- that puts them because they have to take\nthemselves out of their reasonable person mind-set that\nthey're used to applying and figure out how it applies\ndifferently here.\nAnd I think that it doesn't make a lot of sense\nto develop this whole different kind of sideline to the\nnormal Miranda reasonable person test for 6-year-olds\nbecause the very factors that would make them more likely\nto view themselves to be in custody would also make them\nless likely to be able to use these Miranda rules if they\nwere actually -- Miranda rights if they were given them.\nIf -- if a -- if a 6-year-old is going to feel too\nsubmissive to authority, it doesn't make a lot of sense to\napply a lower custody threshold if then he's not going to\nbe able to take advantage of it.\nQUESTION: I really don't understand. If you\nseem to agree that a 6-year-old would be more likely to\nfeel submissive to authority, is -- does it not follow\ninexorably he, therefore, would reasonably feel he could\nnot leave when -- where an older person would?\nMR. ELWOOD: Justice Stevens, our point is that\nbasically we don't require police officers to figure out\nthe mind-set of 16, 17 --\nQUESTION: I wish you would tell me yes or no on\nmy question.\nMR. ELWOOD: I -- I think the -- well, I've\nalready forgotten what it is.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ELWOOD:\nQUESTION: Let me -- let me restate it. You --\nyou say that you -- the 6-year-old would feel more\nsubmissive to -- to an officer. Does it not, therefore,\nfollow that he would be less likely to think he was free\nto leave than an older person would?\nMR. ELWOOD: I think if -- in generalities, yes,\nthat's true, but I also --\nQUESTION: But then isn't age relevant?\nMR. ELWOOD: No, it's not relevant because I\nthink Miranda -- we -- because it's a prophylactic rule,\nit's a supplemental protection in addition to the --\nQUESTION: No.\nMR. ELWOOD: -- voluntariness test.\nQUESTION: Just relevant to the question whether\nhe's in custody. That's the only thing we're asking\nabout, not the Miranda warning.\nMR. ELWOOD: Right. And our point is that --\nQUESTION: And if it -- if it makes a difference\nof his age, why doesn't that make it relevant?\nMR. ELWOOD: Because what we're talking about\nhere is not just 6-year-olds. We have to have a rule that\nis workable for police officers with respect to 17-year-\nolds and people who are 17 years and 7 months and 18 years\nand 1 month. And when you -- when you can say with some\ncertainty that a 6-year-old is going to be feeling more\nvulnerable, but you can't say with a lot of certainty that\nan average 16-year-old is going to be feeling more\nvulnerable than an average 18-year-old, and if so, by how\nmuch. So that, for example, they know that when they\nsay --\nQUESTION: But it's relevant by even a tiny,\ntiny bit if you've got a totality of the circumstances\ntest. To say it isn't very much -- I don't see the\ndifference between a 6-year-old, the 16-year-old, and the\n18-year-old in your presentation.\nMR. ELWOOD: Justice -- Justice Stevens, our\npoint is that it's not relevant because the law says it's\nnot relevant, that the police officer -- all they're\naccountable for is the way a reasonable person would view\nthe circumstances, and they shouldn't be required to\nfigure out -- get inside the head of a reasonable 16-\nyear-old, a reasonable 15-year-old. They just have to\napply one reasonable person standard to the circumstances\nthat are before them.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Elwood.\nMs. Allen, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TARA K. ALLEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. ALLEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nI would first like to start by clearing up some\nthings about the record that the Court was asking about\nearlier. As far as the parents' being refused permission\nto attend the interview, that was a finding of fact made\nin the Federal district court. It is contained in the\nmagistrate's report and recommendations in this case, and\nit can be found at joint appendix 49 and also the\npetitioner's brief, appendix B3.\nQUESTION: Was that based on testimony presented\nin the district court?\nMS. ALLEN: There was no evidentiary hearing in\nthe district court.\nAs far as --\nQUESTION: Then how -- how did the district\ncourt know to make a finding?\nMS. ALLEN: I believe they based it on the\npetition for habeas. This contention --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMS. ALLEN: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: A written petition? And what -- what\nwas the basis for the district court's finding or the\nmagistrate's finding? There was no testimony?\nMS. ALLEN: No, there was no evidentiary hearing\nin the Federal court.\nQUESTION: Then --\nMS. ALLEN: And there was no testimony in the\nState court either.\nQUESTION: Then what is the basis for the\nfinding?\nMS. ALLEN: At the motion to suppress in the\ntrial court, in the State court, the argument was, in both\nthe written motion to suppress and the oral argument in\nfront of the court, that the parents were refused\npermission to attend the interview. The State never\nobjected to that. They never contested it. It was in the\nbriefs on direct appeal and it wasn't contested there.\nThe -- the first time it's been contested is now.\nQUESTION: So -- so you're saying it was the\nsubject of evidence at one point, but in a different\nproceeding, and -- and when the record of the different\nproceeding was used here, no one objected to it.\nMS. ALLEN: No one objected to it. And the\nState has a right to object --\nQUESTION: You're saying it was -- it was the\nsubject of allegation, not of evidence.\nMS. ALLEN: Yes, certainly. And when a\nmagistrate files a report and recommendation, either party\ncan object to any facts that are not correct, and they\ndidn't do that in this case.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMS. ALLEN: Secondarily --\nQUESTION: What's RT? It refers to RT 910 as\nthe cite.\nMS. ALLEN: That was the reporter's transcript\nfrom the motion to suppress at trial -- pretrial.\nSecondarily, there was some contention about\nwhether Detective Comstock was armed. That is also found\nin the joint appendix, page 65, note 29, and it was in the\npetition for writ of habeas corpus in the district court\nas well, citing the -- Alvarado's interview, which is in\nthe joint appendix.\nThere was some contention about whether Mr.\nAlvarado, Michael, was referred to as a suspect. That can\nbe found in the joint appendix, page 189. That was\nargument of trial counsel during the motion to suppress.\nIt was not disputed at that point. It hasn't been\ndisputed until now. But I would assert that in addition\nto that, even if he had not heard another officer refer to\nhim as a suspect, it was obvious by Detective Comstock's\nword and deed to him during the interrogation that he --\nhe indeed was a suspect.\nAnd the last contention is my --\nQUESTION: Well, and your -- your argument is\nthat you think the fact that he thought he was a suspect\nwould make him less likely to feel he was free to leave?\nMS. ALLEN: Yes. And this Court in California\nv. Stansbury found that anytime that it's communicated to\na suspect by word or deed that he is a suspect, that that\ngoes into the totality of the circumstances of whether\nthat person would reasonably feel free to leave.\nSecondly, I would like -- well, one more thing\non the facts. The fact that Michael said, can't somebody\ncome in here with me, is found at the joint appendix, page\n185. That's also trial counsel's argument at the motion\nto suppress that was not disputed until now.\nBut next I would like to -- to move to this idea\nof this being a new context. Miranda is the son of\nvoluntariness and coercion. This Court found in 1948 in\nHaley v. Ohio that juveniles in general are more\nsusceptible to police coercion than adults.\nQUESTION: That -- that was not a Court opinion,\nwas it?\nMS. ALLEN: I don't know, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: You're citing it and you don't know?\nMS. ALLEN: Is it a plurality?\nQUESTION: It was a plurality opinion.\nMS. ALLEN: Plurality of this Court, yes, Your\nHonor.\nIn that case, it recognized that juvenile status\nbe taken into consideration when determining the proper\nprocedural safeguards.\nIn Miranda in 1966, this Court found that those\nprocedural safeguards would be the Miranda warnings.\nAnd then in In re Gault in 1965, the Court found\nthat the greatest care must be taken to assure a minor's\nconfession was voluntary not only in the sense that it was\ncoerced, but also that it's not a product of ignorance of\nrights.\nIt follows --\nQUESTION: What -- what good does -- does a\nMiranda -- I mean, you know -- warning -- what -- what\ngood does it do if you -- if you recite it to a 6-year-\nold? I mean, isn't it -- isn't it really a -- a warning\nthat is designed for a reasonable person, meaning a\nreasonable adult? And so that the situation is as -- as\nhas been portrayed. It's just an objective thing that --\nthat the police are supposed to do.\nMS. ALLEN: If you were to recite a Miranda\nwarning to a 6-year-old, in the waiver determination they\nwould decide whether that 6-year-old understood the waiver\nof his rights, and the evidence would come in there as\nwell.\nQUESTION: Oh, so -- so that even the giving of\na Miranda warning would not suffice.\nMS. ALLEN:\ndoesn't suffice. It severely cuts down the cases in which\nyou can contest coercion.\nQUESTION: Well, coercion of what? I'm not\ntalking about coercion, whether the statement is -- is\ncoerced. They are not contesting that -- that you cannot\nget in the age of the -- of the individual when it comes\nto deciding whether the confession was voluntary or not.\nThey -- they agree that you can for that.\nBut just for the question of whether the person\nwas in custody and therefore has to be given a Miranda\nwarning. It seems to me strange to say that you take into\naccount for that purpose the age of the individual even\nthough you don't take it into account for the purpose of\nwhether he can understand -- can get any benefit out of\nthe Miranda warning at all. You recite a -- a Miranda\nwarning to a 6-year-old. It's not going to mean anything\nto him.\nMS. ALLEN: However, if you cite a Miranda\nwarning to a 17-year-old, it may.\nQUESTION: Well, counsel, the -- the person to\nwhom the warning is given must be found to have waived the\nrights so warned and to have understood that a waiver was\nbeing made. Isn't that true?\nMS. ALLEN: That's correct.\nQUESTION:\nisn't it?\nMS. ALLEN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So -- so that means you cannot\ninterrogate a 6-year-old, neither in custody nor out of\ncustody. Right? 6-year-olds just skip away. That can't\nbe right.\nMS. ALLEN: Usually --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Isn't the question whether we're\ngoing to --\nMS. ALLEN: I -- I --\nQUESTION: Isn't the question whether we're\ngoing to treat them and prosecute them as adults?\nMS. ALLEN: That's -- that's right.\nQUESTION: And we don't -- we don't do that with\n6-year-olds.\nMS. ALLEN: And in most circumstances you're not\nprosecuting 6-year-olds. You're -- you're prosecuting\nteenagers.\nQUESTION: What is the evidence or the\nindication here that the State did not take account of the\nfact that he was a juvenile, but having taken account of\nit in the State proceedings, they just reached the\nconclusion that it didn't in this case matter that much?\nNow, why do we think that that isn't what happened?\nMS. ALLEN: When you read the California State\nopinion in this case, they don't mention Michael's age.\nThey don't mention anything about the fact that he was a\njuvenile or how a reasonable juvenile would have assessed\nthe situation.\nQUESTION: I can understand why they might not\n-- they would mention things that did matter, but if they\nthought it hadn't mattered here, why would we have\nexpected them to mention it?\nMS. ALLEN: Is your question if they thought it\ndidn't matter?\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, is our only indication\nthat they didn't take it into account the fact that they\ndidn't mention it? Because maybe they didn't mention it\nbecause they thought it's only 6 months. It doesn't\nmatter that much. That would be a reason for not\nmentioning it. Or maybe they didn't mention it because\nthe lawyers then didn't make that much of an issue of it.\nI mean, there are a lot of reasons why, when I write an\nopinion, I don't mention things. Usually it's because I\ndon't think it matters.\nMS. ALLEN: Well, the objectively unreasonable\nthing about what the California court did in this case was\nthey recited the correct test for custody, yet they\ncompletely failed to imply it.\nthe totality of the circumstances, they spent their entire\ntime distinguishing a State case from this case and\nfinding that --\nQUESTION: To -- to what extent do we require a\nState court, when we're talking about the AEDPA rules, to\nbe absolutely accurate in following, say, precedent of\nthis Court? I mean, I -- I thought the rule was that it\nwas up to the other -- the other side to point out how\nthey had departed from it.\nMS. ALLEN: As this Court has found, a totality\nmeans a totality.\nQUESTION: Well, then you say that in any --\nevery single Miranda case, a court must take into account\nin its opinion every single circumstance that is mentioned\nin the record?\nMS. ALLEN: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, then what -- why do you say\ntotality?\nMS. ALLEN: Most certainly they should discuss\nthe factors that make a difference, and in this case they\ndidn't. They didn't discuss any of the factors that made\na difference.\nQUESTION: Well, why should they have said that\nthe age of a 17-and-a-half-year-old made a difference?\nMS. ALLEN:\nNot only is it a reasonable juvenile standard, but also\nit's the enlisting of the parental authority to bring him\nto the station, the refusing of permission for the parents\nto attend the interview in front of him.\nQUESTION: Well, that's mentioned in the court's\nopinion, that they brought him to the station house.\nMS. ALLEN: When they're talking about the\nfacts, they take the facts from Detective Comstock's\ninterview where she says, I called the parents and had\nthem come down. She doesn't say anything about refusing\nthem permission.\nQUESTION: That both Mr. and Mrs. Alvarado came\nto the sheriff's station with their son.\nMS. ALLEN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Well, so then they did talk about\nsome of these circumstances. It's not correct to say they\nmentioned none of them.\nMS. ALLEN: They --\nQUESTION: It's right in the opinion.\nMS. ALLEN: They didn't mention that they were\nrefused permission, and they didn't mention that Michael\nwas 17. I guess you can infer from the fact that she\ncalled the parents that he was under the age of majority.\nQUESTION: Well, maybe they didn't mention that\nbecause it's not in the record.\nbeing a little more precise about what -- what should be\nin their opinion than -- than we have been here today. I\nmean --\nMS. ALLEN: Well, part of the record were the --\nthe trial transcripts which included the motion to\nsuppress hearing, and -- and the briefs cited to that and\nthe motion itself. So it was in the record.\nQUESTION: I -- I didn't -- well, I -- I'm not\nsure that you're required -- or it's even proper to take\ninto account allegations that are made in -- in a motion\nto suppress when there's been no evidentiary hearing on\nthem. I don't --\nMS. ALLEN: Well, where they're not disputed by\nthe prosecution and -- and the judge finds no contrary\nfinding and they're argued in all the briefs without the\nrespondent saying that that's not correct, it seems\nreasonable that the court of appeal would -- would take\nthat as fact.\nQUESTION: Why should it matter in the -- in the\n-- why would a court say, oh, yes, I know that age could\nbe -- could be relevant, but this was a 17 and more --\nmore than 17-and-a-half-year-old, closer to 18 than 17? I\nthink in this case age was irrelevant. I mean, it seems\nto me you have a rather bad case on the facts to press the\ndifference in age of somebody who's almost 18.\nMS. ALLEN: I think even if Michael had been 18\nand the court had no duty to apply a reasonable juvenile\nstandard, there are plenty of facts that point toward\ncustody in this case not only the parental involvement,\nbut the very fact that this interrogation took place in an\ninterrogation room at a police station.\nQUESTION: That's the question I asked Mr.\nElwood and he -- his answer was a remand wouldn't be\nappropriate because what the State court held was a -- was\nreasonable.\nMS. ALLEN: What the State court held was\nobjectively unreasonable because they -- they failed to\napply the clearly established Federal law from this Court,\nwhich is Thompson v. Keohane. The recited it, but\ncompletely failed to apply it in any meaningful way.\nQUESTION: In -- in what respect?\nMS. ALLEN: In the respect that that case says\nyou need to look at all of the circumstances surrounding\nan interrogation, and once you add up those circumstances,\nyou decide whether a reasonable person would have felt\nfree to leave. That's a cumulative totality of the\ncircumstances test.\nThe California court did not look at the factors\ntogether cumulatively. They took two factors to\ndistinguish this case, neither of which was proper: one,\nthat the police did not tell him affirmatively that he\ncould not leave until he told the truth, which would be a\nfinding of custody straight off. You would never even get\nto the totality test. And two, that the tactics weren't\nintense and aggressive enough to prove coercion.\nAnd as this case said in Kaupp, interestingly,\njust as you can't require the perversity of resisting\narrest to prove coercion, here you can't require the\nperversity of -- of this being coercive to prove custody.\nYou can't use a -- say that the -- the police had to have\nenlisted intense and aggressive tactics in order for this\nto be custody. That's not even part of the custody\ndetermination. There are things like location. Here it\nwas at a police station. Who initiated the contact. Here\nit was initiated by the detective. Whether the defendant\nvoluntarily came. Here he was brought by his parents at\nthe behest of the detective. Whether he was informed that\nhe was not under arrest. Not only was he not informed of\nthat, he wasn't given anything to sign to say the\ninterview was voluntarily -- voluntary. The length of the\ninterview. He was interrogated for over 2 hours. The\nfamiliarity of the surroundings. And this is where his\ninexperience may go into a -- a circumstances test. He\nhad never been in a police station or an interrogation\nroom. And whether it was communicated to him that he was\na suspect, which it was certainly by Comstock --\nQUESTION: You're -- you're not meeting their\nargument, though. Their argument is it doesn't matter\nthat although voluntariness of the confession later on is\nindeed a subjective inquiry, was it really voluntary on\nthe part of this person, custody or not, is not a\nsubjective inquiry. It is purely objective. Was this\nperson in custody or not in custody? And their argument\nis that determination is to be made from the standpoint of\nwhat a reasonable adult would -- would deduce from the\nsituation. It is objective. It has nothing to do with\nthe subjective feelings of the particular individual,\nwhether because he's too young or because he's -- he's\nmentally not -- not competent or anything else. It is an\nobjective determination. Did the police have this person\nin custody?\nMS. ALLEN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Now, what is -- what is your response\nto that?\nMS. ALLEN: It is an objective determination,\nand nobody is arguing that it should be subjective. The\npetitioner is the one who has created this facade that\nwe're trying to turn an objective test into a subjective\ntest. We're not. The Ninth Circuit is not trying to do\nthat.\nto leave. We're asking whether a reasonable person in his\nposition would have felt free to leave because of such\nfactors as his age and the parental involvement.\nQUESTION: Well, every subjective inquiry uses\nobjective factors. I mean, you're -- you're not making it\nnon-subjective simply because you say whether it's a --\nyou know, an objective 17-and-a-half-year-old who had been\nabused by his parents and who was, you know, off from\nSunday school or whatever and put in every factor in his\nlife and say, well, of course, you know. That -- that's\nsubjective. That's not an objective test at that point\nwhen you're using all sorts of factors that -- that go to\nwhat his thinking was. When -- when you use all of that,\nyou're using the subjective test.\nMS. ALLEN: There's a fine line here. Because\nthe custody test asks how a reasonable person in the\nsuspect's position would have felt free to leave, it's\nsaying how would a reasonable person have felt, how they\nwould have felt free to leave. And that sounds\nsubjective, but you're using objective factors. And the\nfact of juvenile status -- it's not subjective. It's not\na state of mind. It's a status. It's a class that this\nCourt has recognized from the beginning.\nQUESTION: Yes, but not in this particular\ncontext.\nMS. ALLEN: In the context of custodial\ninterrogations and the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth\nAmendment. These are two sides of the same coin. Miranda\nis concerned with exactly the context that this Court has\nrecognized.\nQUESTION: But up -- up to now, it's been\nconcerned with respect to the custody inquiry to the\nexternal circumstances of -- of the person. You know, how\nwould a reasonable person have reacted to these\ncircumstances? Now, you're -- you're saying we don't any\nlonger limit it to that. We look inside the person and\ntry to figure out on his background how we would react,\nand that of course, is -- Justice Scalia says I think --\nis -- is not a -- an objective standard.\nMS. ALLEN: Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I\nrespectfully disagree. We're not asking what was in the\nmind of the person. We're simply saying that this Court\nand other courts in the land and the police need to\nrecognize what is obvious, that juveniles do not assess\ntheir freedom to leave the same way as adults do.\nQUESTION: Well, but you say juveniles, and\nyou're saying the 17-and-a-half-year-old will not assess\nhis freedom to leave in the same way an 18-year-old. That\njust doesn't make any sense at all.\nMS. ALLEN:\njurisprudence has drawn lines with juveniles versus\nadults. When things are close to the line, it's going to\nbe fuzzy, but to say what the petitioner is arguing, that\nit never matters, that a 12-year-old would assess their\nfreedom to leave the same as a 35-year-old, it can't be\ntrue.\nQUESTION: Well, it certainly matters for\ndetermining voluntariness of any statement. Was that ever\nchallenged at trial?\nMS. ALLEN: No, it wasn't. The --\nQUESTION: That's kind of odd, isn't it?\nMS. ALLEN: It is. The main contentions at\ntrial were, one, that the Miranda wasn't read and he was\nin custody, and two, that when he said, can't somebody be\nin here with me, that that as a request for counsel.\nQUESTION: But never an assertion that the\nstatements were involuntary.\nMS. ALLEN: No, no.\nQUESTION: And all of these things would be\nrelevant in the voluntariness inquiry, would they not?\nMS. ALLEN: Yes, sure.\nQUESTION: If juvenility must be taken into\naccount for the custody determination, how -- how is it\nthat it is not taken into account for the purpose of what\nthe nature of the warning has to be, assuming custody? I\nmean, we have one Miranda warning that presumably I have\nalways thought is given to everybody from the 6-year-old\nto the senior citizen.\nMS. ALLEN: And --\nQUESTION: Now, if -- if, indeed as you say,\nrelevant to this whole thing is -- is the age of the\nperson, we ought to have different Miranda warnings, an 8-\nyear-old Miranda warning, a 17-and-a-half-year-old Miranda\nwarning, and so forth.\nMS. ALLEN: I have two things to say about that,\nJustice Scalia. One is many States do employ a different\nMiranda warning for juveniles in their statutes.\nSecondly, this Court in Miranda, when putting down the\nwarning, I assume it applies to both juveniles and adults,\nand ignoring the -- the juvenile status is basically\nmaking it an adult standard. If you're applying an adult\nstandard to juveniles instead of providing for the\ngreatest care, you would actually be giving them less\nprotection to which they're entitled under the clearly\nestablished Federal law.\nQUESTION: And is it also not true that in many,\nmany cases, voluntariness may remain an issue, for\nexample, as in Oregon against Elstad. If there's a\npreliminary question followed by Miranda warnings, you\nfirst have to look at the voluntariness of the first\ninterrogation. So we haven't abandoned voluntariness as a\nrelevant issue in these cases.\nMS. ALLEN: No, not at all, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Does that help your case or hurt your\ncase? I -- I -- I would think -- I thought that was the\nargument of the other side, that you -- you can raise all\nof this on the voluntariness point. You don't have to get\nit in on the -- on the quite objective factor of whether\nthere is custody or not.\nQUESTION: Sure you can, but voluntariness is\nretrospective, and Miranda is prospective. So if you're\ntrying to protect people's rights from the beginning, it\nshould be taken into account at the beginning instead of\nwaiting until the end when it's too late essentially.\nIt's very hard to meet a voluntariness test when this\ncould be taken care of on the front end by police giving\npeople their 15-second Miranda warnings, particularly\njuveniles who they know are going to assess their freedom\nto leave differently than adults.\nSo unless the Court has any other questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Allen.\n"
