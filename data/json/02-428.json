        "content": "(10:55 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in Number 02-428, Dastar Corporation versus Twentieth\nCentury Fox Film Corporation.\nMr. Gerber.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. GERBER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GERBER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nDastar discovered that an old TV show made by\nTime Inc. was in the public domain because Fox neglected\nto renew the copyright. Dastar adapted the public domain\nshow at considerable expense to make it into a war\nnarrative as opposed to Eisenhower's story. Dastar's\nproduct did not refer to Time Inc. Dastar's product also\ndid not refer to respondents who had their own competitive\nvideo of the same TV show.\nQUESTION: Of the same what?\nMR. GERBER: TV show.\nBecause of the latter, that is, the omission of\ncredits to respondents, and the finding that Dastar acted\nwillfully in omitting those credits, the lower court\nawarded $1.6 million, substantially in excess of the\n$850,000 total gross of Dastar, in order to deter it.\nThe lower courts departed from the Lanham Act in\na very expansionary way in our view in six separate\ndimensions.\nQUESTION: Can we go back to your statement? As\nI -- as I understood it, it wasn't the omission of Fox,\nbut the addition of your people. In other words, it\nwasn't the failure to give credit to respondents, but it\nwas petitioner's taking credit for it that was what the\nlower courts thought was wrong.\nMR. GERBER: Taking the lower courts in\nascending order, on page 53a of the cert petition, the\nlanguage is that the court finds that defendant's failure\nto identify the television series and the book is\nmisleading to the public. And then at the Ninth Circuit\nlevel, on page 3a of the petition, the language is that\nDastar copied, et cetera, and marketed it without\nattribution to Fox.\nNeither court, Justice Ginsburg, examined\nDastar's credits, affirmative credits, for accuracy, for\nwhether they registered with the consumers, for\nmisleadingness or falsity in any way. I would suggest\nthat the record indeed is that it was the omission of\ncredits for their competitors that was, in fact, the basis\nfor the double award.\nQUESTION: This is a failure -- this is a\nfailure to attribute case then?\nMR. GERBER: Yes, it is, Your Honor.\nOur first and most sweeping point --\nQUESTION: But may I just point out on 3a, it --\nthe quote -- you left out the first clause I think.\nThey -- they labeled the -- the resulting product with a\ndifferent name and marketed it without attribution.\nMR. GERBER: Oh, yes. That's a reference to\nchanging the title of the work. The entire phrase -- and\npardon my truncation of it -- on page 3a is that Dastar\ncopied substantially the entire Crusade in Europe series\ncreated by Twentieth Century Fox, labeled the resulting\nproduct with a different name, and marketed it without\nattribution. The name Dastar put on it, instead of\nCrusade in Europe, was World War II Campaigns in Europe.\nAnd you will, I believe, see that in neither\nopinion does either court take a look at the credits on\nDastar's product and conclude that they were in any way\nmisleading, nor does the court examine them at all.\nOur first --\nQUESTION: Counsel, would -- would the new\nDastar video qualify as a derivative work that would\ndeserve copyright protection on its own?\nMR. GERBER: Yes, yes. The --\nQUESTION: And is that issue being litigated?\nMR. GERBER: No, it isn't.\nQUESTION: No. Thank you.\nMR. GERBER: Our -- our most sweeping statutory\npoint is, while not necessary for this opinion\ncertainly -- this case, certainly would dispose of it,\nthat the current version of the governing statute, Lanham\nAct 43(a)(1)(A), does not recognize reverse passing off at\nall. The judicial interpretations of the Lanham Act,\nunder which this claim was born, were under a prior\nversion that was substantially amended in 1988, and while\nno court has construed the '88 language, we think that the\nnatural and plain meaning of it is that it encompasses\nonly forward passing off.\nQUESTION: Only what kind of passing?\nMR. GERBER: Forward passing off.\nQUESTION: What is forward passing off? It\nsounds like a football game.\nMR. GERBER: It's not football, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GERBER: It is the standard type of\ntrademark or trade dress infringement in which the\nwrongdoer -- let's call it Brand X -- utilizes the mark\nRolex -- of usually a well-recognized company and puts\nthat mark on its product.\nQUESTION: Is it some kind of affirmative\nmisrepresentation?\nMR. GERBER: In forward passing off?\nQUESTION: Mm-hmm.\nMR. GERBER: I -- I --\nQUESTION: To -- to get some kind of liability\nunder the Lanham Act under a reverse passing off theory.\nMR. GERBER: If I may first distinguish reverse\npassing off and then come back to Your Honor's question.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. GERBER: Reverse passing off, in contrast,\nis where Brand X for some reason -- the commercial\nmotivation is often hard to discern -- gets a legitimate\nRolex, removes the Rolex name and puts the Brand X name on\nit. Instead of passing its goods off as Rolex, it's\npassing Rolex's goods off as its own.\nI'm sorry, Justice O'Connor, I --\nQUESTION: Well, it's -- it's related to this.\nThis is a so-called reverse passing off theory that the\nNinth Circuit is relying on. Right?\nMR. GERBER: Yes.\nQUESTION: And do you say there is no such thing\nat all or do you acknowledge that there could be some\nLanham Act violation if there were some kind of\naffirmative misrepresentation?\nMR. GERBER: Both. Our -- our most ambitious\nargument is none at all, and we do have as a less\nambitious argument the second.\nQUESTION: Indeed, the Solicitor General would\nurge that we -- we not take the broader view. Right?\nMR. GERBER: I don't believe so, from the\nSolicitor General's brief. And let me --\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, we'll find out in a\nminute.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GERBER: Yes. I -- our view, which I\nbelieve is shared by the Solicitor General, is that under\nthe particular statute in issue in this case, subsection\n(a)(1)(A), reverse passing off is a no.\nQUESTION: Where -- where is that? Let's --\nlet's look at the statute and talk about it.\nMR. GERBER: It's on -- it's on page 2 of the\ncert petition.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. GERBER: And if I may present our most\nsweeping argument, the language in particular in (a)(1)(A)\nrequires a designation as to the origin, sponsorship, or\napproval of Dastar's goods by another person. So that\nwould naturally cover the situation in which Dastar's\ngoods had the name of another person such as Fox on them,\nbut it would not cover the situation in which Dastar's\ngoods had its own name on them because of the by another\nperson language. When Fox's name is on Dastar's goods --\nand that is the normal passing off, forward passing off --\nthere is a designation that Fox sponsored Dastar's goods\nor approved it or was the origin of it. But you can --\nQUESTION: Now, I mean, that's -- that's one\nreading of that. I mean, you could say -- and maybe --\nmaybe it's the more natural reading -- that as to the\norigin by another person means that some other person\noriginated it. But it could mean as to the origin by\nanother person, if I represent that I originated it, okay,\nwhen in fact another person originated it, I would be\nmaking a misrepresentation as to the origin by another\nperson because I'm denying that that other person\noriginated it. I'm saying that I did.\nmisrepresentation as to the origin by another person?\nMR. GERBER: I don't think -- the -- the latter\nprinciple that Your Honor stated I think would be correct,\nbut I would suggest that it's not illustrated by the\nexample.\nI think Your Honor is perhaps looking at the as\nto language here. And in our view what that means is that\na representation by Dastar that Fox did sponsor Dastar's\nwork or that Fox did not sponsor Dastar's work would be\ncovered.\nQUESTION: Yes, either it did or did not.\nEither it did or did not.\nMR. GERBER: But neither of -- both of those are\nin contrast to reverse passing off in which the offending\nparty is putting its own name on the work. So that\ndoesn't help.\nAnd the -- the other argument -- the other\nconstruction, which is the only competitor on the table\nhere by respondents to --\nQUESTION: Well, excuse me. Before you get\non --\nMR. GERBER: Excuse me, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: When -- when you put your own name on\nit, aren't you denying that it was originated by somebody\nelse?\nMR. GERBER: You're not stating that it was\noriginated by another person, and that is the statutory\nrequirement.\nQUESTION: You're -- you're stating that it was\nnot. You're saying that it was not originated by another\nperson. And that seems to me it could be interpreted as\nbeing a misrepresentation as to the origin by another\nperson.\nMR. GERBER: Well, I --\nQUESTION: If you put your name on it, you're\nsaying I did it. Nobody else did it. You -- you made\na -- well --\nMR. GERBER: Pardon me. I -- I would rely on\nthe statutory distinction. It's one thing to make a\nrepresentation that the wrongdoer is the originator, with\nwhatever implications that may have, and another to make a\nmisrepresentation which -- which seems down the middle of\nthe alley of the statutory language, that another person,\nFox, originated the work.\nQUESTION: Well, and is this affected at all by\nthe fact that the copyright had expired? This was in the\npublic domain.\nMR. GERBER: Well --\nQUESTION: Is there some -- how does that affect\nit?\nthe public domain?\nMR. GERBER: That, separate and apart from the\nmost sweeping argument we have, really goes to a number of\nother attacks on what the lower court did. The short\nanswer is you can if it is not likely --\nQUESTION: Mr. Gerber, I'd like to go back to\nwhat the lower court did because I don't think that you\nwere accurate when you said in the view of the lower\ncourt, this was a non-attribution case. I'm looking at\npage 53, and the court indeed does start out by saying\nthat defendants failed to identify the series, but then\nthere's a semicolon, and it goes on to say --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. Where -- where is this?\nAt what page -- what page are we on?\nQUESTION: 53 -- 53a of the petition.\nI'm questioning Mr. Gerber's characterization\nthat this case is simply a non-attribution one because\nafter the semicolon, it says why that was a problem.\nIt's -- it gives the false impression that the series\ncontains only the work of those listed in the credits. So\nthat was the problem that was central for the district\ncourt, not simply a non-attribution, but an incorrect\nattribution. And I don't see how you can ignore that\nclear statement by the district court.\nMR. GERBER:\none is talking about the -- the wheat and the chaff, on\npage 31a in which the district court introduces its\nlengthy discussion, the statement is that the lawsuit is\nbased on defendant's distribution of a video series, which\nplaintiffs claim is an infringement of the protected\nmaterial found in the book, and is an appropriation of the\ntelevision series, Crusade in Europe, without proper\ncredit.\nNow, the reason I think that is the correct\ninterpretation of what the district court was doing --\nQUESTION: Without proper credit could mean\nimproper credit, but when the court is developing that\npoint in full, it says there are two things. It was the\nfailure to identify. Why was that a violation of the\nLanham Act in the court's view? Because it gave the false\nimpression that only those listed --\nMR. GERBER: Yes. I would suggest that without\nproper credit means what it says. It doesn't mean\nimproper credit. It means that the proper credits were\nnot affixed.\nAnd then, of course, when you look at the Ninth\nCircuit -- Circuit --\nQUESTION: It was an improper attribution case,\nnot simply a non-attribution case. I'm simply questioning\nyour original characterization which I do not think pays\nattention to what the district court, in fact, said.\nMR. GERBER: I understand, Justice Ginsburg, but\nagain I would urge that without proper credit, that\nphrase, is not a statement that there were improper\ncredits. It's a statement that the proper credits were\nabsent. And I would add that whatever ambiguity may lurk\nin the district court's findings, it's quite clear that at\nthe Ninth Circuit level, which, of course, is what this\nCourt is reviewing, the case is a non-attribution case.\nQUESTION: The Ninth Circuit had a rather quick,\nunpublished opinion --\nMR. GERBER: Correct.\nQUESTION: -- in this case.\nMR. GERBER: We agree with that.\nQUESTION: So it didn't tell us very much.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GERBER: If -- if I may turn just for a\nmoment to some of the -- to the question 2, the remedies\nissue. Here we would urge that the statutory language and\nlegislative intent, to the extent that it is pertinent,\ncoalesce. Subject to the principles of equity, means\nsubject to the principles of equity.\nThis Court, while the Lanham Act was being\ndebated, applied equitable principles in an intellectual\nproperty case to define the circumstances under which\nprofits may be disgorged. That's the Sheldon case. And\nit said equitable disgorgement of profits is permissible\nonly for restitutionary purposes, only to restore to\nplaintiff something that he has lost. That by definition\nprecludes a purely deterrent award which is not\nrestitutionary in the slightest.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I would\nlike to reserve my remaining time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Gerber.\nMr. Garre, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe petitioner in this case did not make any\nfalse designation as to the origin of its good, a\nvideotaped series on World War II, when it put its own\nlabel on that good. Petitioner manufactured the good at\nissue in this case, the video series. It produced it and\nit and it distributed it to consumers. Under this Court's\ndecisions interpreting the Lanham Act and under the Lanham\nAct itself, petitioner is, therefore, the origin of the\ngood at issue at this case and is the source of that good\nin the way that this Court has used that term.\nIn 1990, Congress addressed the question of\nartistic attribution and it addressed it in the -- in the\ncontext of the copyright laws. And it --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. Before you go on,\nsuppose -- suppose they hadn't edited the -- the prior\nCrusade in Europe thing at all. They had not done\nanything to it, didn't have a -- a new introduction,\ndidn't have the little snippets of addition that they had.\nHowever, they did, indeed, make the copies and they --\nthey made the -- the plastic cassette in which it was\ninserted and so forth.\nWould you take the position that -- that they\nwere the origin of that -- of that product and therefore\ncould represent that it was their product?\nMR. GARRE: We -- we would take that position,\nJustice Scalia, and I think that -- that would be\nconsistent with the way this Court has consistently\ninterpreted the term origin, if you look at the Wal-Mart\ncase, the Qualitex case, and going back to the concurring\ndecisions in the Two Pesos, which is to refer to the\nsource of production or manufacture.\nQUESTION: Production not in the Hollywood sense\nof production.\nMR. GARRE: Absolutely, and --\nQUESTION:\nthis -- this physical article.\nMR. GARRE: That's correct, Justice Scalia. And\nthat's -- of course, we encourage the intellectual\nproperty laws, and this Court's decisions encourage firms\nto go out and copy goods that come into the public domain.\nIn the Court's recent TrafFix case --\nQUESTION: That's what this was, in the public\ndomain, was it not?\nMR. GARRE: That's correct. The television --\nQUESTION: Do you think that this Dastar product\ncould have been copyrightable as a derivative work on its\nown?\nMR. GARRE: We do think that it could be\ncopyrightable as a derivative work to the extent that it's\nnot subject to copyright protection. Of course, the --\nthe original television series was subject to a copyright,\nbut that copyright expired in 1977 because respondent,\nTwentieth Century Fox, failed to renew it. And of course,\nif -- if the respondent had renew it, one suspects that we\nwouldn't be here today arguing about the -- an expansive\ninterpretation of the Lanham Act.\nNow, Congress has addressed the -- the question\nof artistic rights of attribution. It did so in the\ncontext of the copyright laws, and it did so very\ncarefully.\nartistic attribution in 1990, but it limited those rights\nto a small class of visual arts, made them personal to the\nauthor of those works, and limited the duration of the\nlife -- limited the duration of the -- the rights to the\nlife of the author.\nIn this case, the Ninth Circuit recognized a\ngeneral right of artistic attribution that is not limited\nin time, that applies to a work, an audiovisual work, that\nCongress specifically exempted from the scope of its 1990\nlegislation and that is not personal to the author of the\nwork, which in this case was Time Inc. who initially\nproduced the television series.\nQUESTION: Now, is there -- is there no -- I\nunderstand you're saying I say I produced this, all it\nmeans is I produced this physical object. But suppose in\naddition the person says I produced this -- this physical\nobject and, moreover, I -- I produced the show that is on\nthis physical object. That is, I'm using produced in the\nHollywood sense now. Is there -- is there -- when in fact\nI didn't. I just did a little bit and most of it was done\nby Fox.\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nQUESTION: Is there no remedy for that? Because\nthat's what they say occurred here. They -- they wouldn't\nmind your just saying, you know, I -- I am the maker of\nthis cassette or of this disk. They wouldn't mind that.\nBut -- but what happened was that on the disk it said I am\nthe artistic producer of this thing. That's what they're\ncomplaining about. Now, is there no remedy for that when\nthey weren't?\nMR. GARRE: Two responses. First, when they\nlabeled a good that they manufactured and produced as\ntheir own good, they didn't make any false designation of\norigin within the meaning of section (a)(1)(A) of the\nLanham Act.\nNow, as we've discussed in our brief, section\n(a)(1)(B) of the Lanham Act, which the respondents in this\ncase have never invoked and the courts below didn't\naddress, isn't limited to false designations of origin.\nIt applies to false designations that misrepresent the\nnature or qualities or characteristics of a good.\nSo the second type of description that Your\nHonor characterized conceivably could fall within the\nscope of section (a)(1)(B), but of course section\n(a)(1)(B) was not raised in this case and it's also\nlimited to the context of commercial advertising and\nprotection.\nThe purpose of the Lanham Act and the trademark\nlaws -- and this is made clear in the definition of\ntrademark that appears at 15 U.S.C. 1127, is to ensure\nthat firms identify and distinguish their goods in order\nto prevent consumer confusion as to the source of goods.\nQUESTION: There isn't any general Federal\nanti-lying law --\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nQUESTION: -- that you could get these people --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GARRE: No. There's -- there's another\nsource, Justice Scalia, and we've mentioned in note 7 of\nour brief, the Federal Trade Commission Act gives the\nFederal Trade Commission authority to go out and address\ndeceptive or unfair trade practices. But that statute too\nisn't limited to false designations of origin. Origin\ndoesn't even appear in that -- in that statute. Origin\nhas --\nQUESTION: If I -- if I just read the -- the\nlabel on the videotape and it says Campaigns in Europe and\nit's identical to Crusades in Europe, and I want to sue\nunder (B) because I've just bought something that\nduplicated what I bought last week, does the label\nconstitute commercial advertising or promotion?\nMR. GARRE: We haven't addressed that issue,\nJustice Kennedy, and -- and there is some varying case law\non that. I think most courts would probably answer that\nquestion in the negative.\nsection (a)(1)(B) to refer to advertising in the print\nad --\nQUESTION: Well, then (B) doesn't -- doesn't\nhelp and if -- if --\nMR. GARRE: Well, of course --\nQUESTION: -- in the case I put, the -- the hope\nyou hold out for us under (B) isn't -- isn't very\npromising unless you're talking about sitting and reading\nwhat comes on in -- in --\nMR. GARRE: Of course, advertising is often --\nQUESTION: -- in the credits which no one ever\nreads.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GARRE: Advertising is often associated with\nthe sale of products, but more importantly, (a)(1)(A) is\naddressed -- it's intended to ensure that consumers can\nlook at a product and identify the source of that product\nso if they do have complaints about the product, they can\ngo to that person. And notably, in this case, no consumer\nwho has ever purchased petitioner's videos has registered\nany complaint along the lines that Your Honor is\nsuggesting. And if --\nQUESTION: Well, I'm -- I'm supposing a case,\nand I thought you had indicated that (B) might cover it,\nbut there has to be some advertising other than what's\non -- on the label.\nMR. GARRE: Under section (a)(1)(B), that's\ncorrect, but I think that the important distinction\nbetween (a)(1)(B) and (a)(1)(A) in this case with respect\nto origin is that -- is that (a)(1)(A) is limited to\nfalse designations of origin or as to sponsorship or\napproval, and -- and the latter two elements, sponsorship\nor approval, aren't addressed in -- in this case.\n(a)(1)(B) is much broader and -- and would include the\ntypes of other representations that Your Honor is\nconcerned about.\nAnd of course, all this we think goes back to\nthe notion that respondents seek artistic attribution for\ntheir product.\nQUESTION: May I -- on that score, may I go back\nto your answer to Justice O'Connor's question about the --\nthe possibility of copyright as derivative work? Would\nthat copyright cover not only the new material, but all\nthe original material that they incorporated in?\nMR. GARRE: I believe that the copyright would\ncover the new material. And of course, the --\nQUESTION: So -- so that if they -- if they did\nthat, if they got that copyright, they then couldn't turn\naround and sue for copyright infringement when the\noriginal Crusade in Europe was -- was marketed by the\nothers.\nMR. GARRE: I -- I think that's right. We\nhaven't addressed that --\nQUESTION: Okay. Okay.\nMR. GARRE: -- question in detail in our brief.\nQUESTION: But your -- in that case your -- your\nunderstanding is that it's only the new material that\nwould be subject to copyright.\nMR. GARRE: Under the derivative work.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. GARRE: I believe that that's true.\nBut we think it's also important that when a\nconsumer buys the product in this case, a video -- a\npackage of videotapes on World War II, the consumer\ndoesn't purchase the intellectual property on those tapes.\nAnd that's the purpose of the FBI warning that appears at\nthe very beginning of -- of the tape. The consumer\npurchases a videotape series package and a copy of that\nwhich it can view at home. Nothing in the Lanham Act,\nwhich is not an artistic credit statute, required the\npetitioner in this case to provide any attribution to the\ntrue creator of the television series that petitioner\ninitially copied.\nQUESTION: Or prevented him from -- prevented\nthem from making a misattribution.\nMR. GARRE: Well, we -- we think that -- that's\ntrue with respect to authorship because we don't think\nauthorship or -- or the concept of invention is covered by\n(a)(1)(A).\nAnd, of course, the notion of attribution that\nrespondents would urge this Court to adopt this case would\nhave to apply to other types of goods like the sign stand\nin the TrafFix case. No one in TrafFix suggested that\npetitioner could go out and reverse engineer and copy the\nsign stand which had entered the public domain. But that\nwhen it did that, it had to go and give credit to\nMarketing Displays, the firm that initially had the -- the\npatent on that, or to the original inventor himself,\nRobert Sarkisian.\nNow --\nQUESTION: Mr. Garre, before you finish, there\nwas a reference in your brief that I didn't follow. It\ncropped up in another brief too, and it had -- it was a\nreference to the Berne Convention. Could you -- what is\nthe relevance of that international treaty to this -- to\nthis case?\nMR. GARRE: May I answer that question?\nQUESTION: Briefly.\nMR. GARRE: It is relevant in that it's an\ninternational convention that -- that covers copyrights,\nbut we explain our brief it -- we don't think that it\naffects the analysis in this case because it -- as -- as\nthe Berne Convention Implementation Act states, it doesn't\nexpand or reduce existing rights under -- under domestic\nlaw.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Garre.\nMR. GARRE: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Ms. Cendali, we'll hear from you.\nQUESTION: It's still too high.\n(Laughter.)\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DALE M. CENDALI\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. CENDALI: Italians.\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThis is not a case about copying. It's a case\nabout deception. No one is disputing that someone has the\nright to copy works when they're no longer protected by\ncopyright or patent, but as this Court has long recognized\nin decisions like Bonita Boats, Sears, and Compco, that\ndoesn't give you the right to create consumer confusion in\nhow you label such works.\nThis, I should correct, is not a case about a\nwork that's actually in the public domain. Since the\nNinth Circuit decision, as we've explained in our brief,\nwe retried the work for hire issue.\nonce again affirmed her previous summary judgment decision\nthat the work was work for hire. So the underlying book\nby General Eisenhower is, in fact, still protected by\ncopyright, though they intend to appeal.\nIn any case, here Dastar violated the Lanham Act\nby advertising, packaging, titling, and crediting Crusade\nin Europe in a manner intentionally designed to give the\nfalse impression that it was an original product\noriginally created by it. And Dastar knew, moreover, that\nconsumer confusion was likely. Norman Andersen, Dastar's\nPresident, admitted that a consumer would not be happy to\nhave purchased a copy of Campaigns if he or she already\nhad a copy of Crusade.\nQUESTION: But the -- the issue is whether the\nLanham Act creates a cause of action with respect to that\nparticular unhappiness. What do you respond to the\ncontention that the word origin in this provision simply\nmeans who manufactured it, not whose -- whose idea it was?\nAnd to put it in -- it applies in a patent\ncontext as -- as well. You know these -- these vise grips\nthat you can have a pliers that will hold on automatically\nuntil you release it. Suppose the patent has -- has\nexpired on that, and I produce an identical copy of -- of\nthe vise grip and I sell it and I say, you know,\nmanufactured by Scalia.\nnot my idea? I want you to know that, you know, Mr. Vise\nGrip is the guy that -- that originally did it.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I don't have to say that, do I?\nMS. CENDALI: Absolutely not, Your Honor, and\nwe're not urging that, but --\nQUESTION: And what if I say, and moreover it\nwas my original idea? Would there be a cause of action\nunder the Lanham Act?\nMS. CENDALI: Yes, that would --\nQUESTION: It would be.\nMS. CENDALI: If -- if you hold yourself out\nfalsely --\nQUESTION: Oh, my.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. CENDALI: If you hold yourself out falsely\nas the inventor of a product when you are not, that\ncreates liability under the Lanham Act.\nQUESTION: Why? What does -- what does that\nhave to do with -- all right. I don't see it.\nQUESTION: Why is it -- I mean, why is it Lanham\nAct rather than Copyright Act?\nMS. CENDALI: Well, the Copyright Act just deals\nwith copying, people making copies of something and\nselling it.\nthat's what -- that's what this is. It's not just that\nthey made the copies, but by crediting themselves as the\ncreator of Campaigns in Europe, they were able to jump\nstart their video business and to be able to then get all\nthe good will associated with that product and say, look,\nwe can make these videos --\nQUESTION: No. I -- I realize that, but you\nsay, well, the Copyright Act is concerned with copying.\nIt's -- it's concerned basically with -- with copying a\ncertain intellectual content. That's what's -- that's\nwhat they're trying to protect.\nMS. CENDALI: That's right.\nQUESTION: The Lanham Act, I thought, was not\ntrying to protect intellectual content. It doesn't have\nto. There's another statute there. The Lanham Act, I\nthought, wanted to make it clear -- wanted producers to\nmake it clear who is at fault if somebody buys the product\nand doesn't like it. There's no deception here about\nthat, is there? They know they're going to go to Dastar\nand raise the devil if -- if they don't like it. Isn't\nthat the point of the Lanham Act?\nMS. CENDALI: No, Your Honor. For one thing, if\nthey don't like the content and they go to Dastar, they'll\nhave no one to talk to.\nWith regard to the purposes of the Lanham Act,\nas this Court has made clear in Inwood and in Qualitex --\nQUESTION: No, but they will have somebody to\ntalk to. Dastar will say -- I'm assuming they are honest\npeople, and they will say, well, yes, we did that. You --\nMS. CENDALI: But --\nQUESTION: -- you don't like the fact that we\ncopied this other stuff and said it was ours? We're the\nones to blame.\nMS. CENDALI: But the purposes of the Lanham\nAct, as this Court has made clear numerous occasions,\nmost -- very recently in Qualitex, is to let consumers be\nable to know when they're getting a product, if they want\nto get -- if they like it, they want to get other things\nfrom that product -- from that supplier, they can.\nQUESTION: Dastar knows who to plagiarize.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: When -- when I see the Dastar name,\nI'm getting good stuff.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. CENDALI: Well -- well, Your Honor, you just\ndon't know whether the next person they plagiarize is\ngoing to be as good as Twentieth Century Fox --\nQUESTION: That's why I'm relying -- yes, but\nI'm relying on them.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: They -- they knew who to copy the\nfirst time. It seems to me that is just as much a -- a\nguarantee that they'll know who to copy the next time, as\nif they had made it themselves.\nMS. CENDALI: Well, the other problem with it,\nbeyond the fact that they are deprived, because you have\nno idea whether the next time they copy will be as good as\nthe first time, you're also depriving the consumer of the\nability to end up buying two of the same product, a very\nreal possibility that they would recognize.\nQUESTION: That's right, and they -- and they\ncan go to -- and they can go to Dastar and raise the\ndevil. They said, you didn't tell us that you copied that\nother thing. We'll never buy Dastar again. But they know\nexactly who to blame.\nMS. CENDALI: They don't know who to blame\nbecause if someone buys Campaigns and Crusade, they will\nnot know who cheated them. They will not be able to tell.\nThe products are lodged with the Court. The Court can\nlook at them. If you bought them both, if I bought my dad\none for Christmas and another one for him for his\nbirthday, he's not going to be happy to find he has\n2 hours of the same -- two copies of the same 7-hour\nvideotape. And in page 205 of the record, it's clear that\nthere are 7 hours of content in that.\nQUESTION: But the same point. Why can't he sue\nor you sue Dastar?\nMS. CENDALI: You wouldn't know who to sue. And\nmaybe he also would think --\nQUESTION: You sue the person you bought it\nfrom.\nMS. CENDALI: But it could have been Fox. He\nwouldn't have known who was the one telling the truth.\nMoreover, he also wouldn't know -- maybe he would think,\nyou know what?\nQUESTION: Well, he can sue -- he can sue them\nboth and find out.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. CENDALI: I don't know if that's -- that's\nthe -- the best way the law should deal with it. Going\nback to Justice Scalia's question, though, about origin,\nthere's nothing in the Lanham Act to suggest that Congress\nwanted to limit the word origin to just the manufacture of\na product.\nNow, in Justice Stevens' concurring opinion in\nTwo Pesos, he specifically noted that the term origin has\nexpanded over time from its original roots as denoting\ngeographic origin, a concept that's now in (a)(1)(B) of\nthe Lanham Act, to encompass origin of both source and\nmanufacture.\nis something different from manufacture.\nWhat is source? Going back to Justice O'Connor\nwriting for the Court in Feist, in talking about origin,\noriginator, author, the common reading of what --\nQUESTION: Yes, but there is -- there is a sort\nof an ambiguity or at least a debate over what the source\nis. I think your Traficante -- the -- the sign that stood\nup well in the wind -- what obligation did the -- did the\nsecond manufacturer have to say the idea was somebody\nelse's?\nMS. CENDALI: Absolutely none. They could --\nQUESTION: Why not? Why isn't it the same case?\nMS. CENDALI: It's not at all the same case.\nBut when you're -- because you're simply selling a\nphysical product -- if all Dastar did here was sell\nCrusade in Europe as Crusade in Europe, it would be a\ntotally different case. But what they did here is they\nheld themselves out as the maker of it, as the creator of\nit.\nQUESTION: No, but they didn't hold themselves\nout as the people who took all the pictures. A lot of\nthem were secondhand pictures, you know, taken by news\nphotographers and all sorts of people.\nMS. CENDALI: They held themselves out by\nputting their names and only their names on the credits,\nby -- by having a special thanks to the National Archives\nright before their names, when they admitted they had no\ncontact -- contact with the National Archives with regard\nto creating these products, by putting only a '95\ncopyright notice on it, by -- by listing only themselves\nas producers. The only conclusion one can reach --\nQUESTION: I don't -- I don't readily see the\ndifference between that and the sign situation. The sign\nmanufacturer wants everybody to think what a brilliant\nbuilder of signs he is. He has a lot of other models in\nhis catalog.\nMS. CENDALI: But the sign manufacturer -- when\nwe deal with products, we don't normally think, when you\nhave a product, that someone is saying I invented this.\nWe're accustomed to lots of people selling similar\nproducts. The commercial context is very different.\nQUESTION: Is what you're -- is what you're\nsaying that when you buy the books or the videotape,\nyou're buying it because you think it's going to be\ndifferent and you're disappointed when you find out that\nit isn't. With -- with TrafFix you know if it's a sign\nthat stands in the wind that --\nMS. CENDALI: Well, you're right, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But that goes again to what I --\nJustice Souter's initial line of questioning. I -- I\nreally think it's the major problem in the case for me.\nQUESTION: Yes, and --\nQUESTION: What you do is you sue the seller\nDastar -- Dastar -- for misrepresenting.\nMS. CENDALI: But --\nQUESTION: And -- and that Fox is not the\ninjured person.\nMS. CENDALI: I maybe can help you on that, Your\nHonor --\nQUESTION: And that's critical in the case for\nme.\nMS. CENDALI: -- because -- because the Lanham\nAct does not provide a cause of action for consumers. So\nif you -- if you posit the idea that consumers need to --\ncan sue Dastar if they're disgruntled, they cannot do that\nunder the Lanham Act. The Lanham Act provides -- it's\nbeen well recognized that there's only -- there's no cause\nof action for consumers. The only people then who can\nsue --\nQUESTION: There's no cause of action if a\ncommercial advertising misrepresents the nature of the --\nof the goods?\nMS. CENDALI: No, Your Honor. There's been --\nif you can look in McCarthy, there's well-established case\nlaw.\nQUESTION: No. But who has the cause of action?\nThe cause of action is the other company.\nMS. CENDALI: The -- that's right. The people\nwho can sue are people such as -- as respondents --\nQUESTION: All right.\nMS. CENDALI: -- who are -- who are -- who have\nhad some other company come along, steal the --\nQUESTION: No, I -- I --\nMS. CENDALI: -- good will of this product\nand --\nQUESTION: I realize.\nQUESTION: Well, you know, I -- I -- this just\ntotally ignores the fact that it was in the public domain.\nI mean, of course, they had a right to copy it. Why\ndidn't Fox renew the copyright if they wanted to do that?\nMS. CENDALI: Your Honor, they had --\nQUESTION: You wouldn't have all this trouble if\nthey had renewed the copyright.\nMS. CENDALI: There's -- there's no issue if\nthey simply copied it as Crusade in Europe and sold it as\nCrusade in Europe. There -- we would not be here on a\nLanham Act cause of action. Our problem is, as we said in\nour complaint at -- at paragraphs 12 and 22 I believe,\nwhat they did was that they held themselves out as the\nproducers.\nQUESTION: No, but isn't the --\nQUESTION: Does someone have a right to go in\nand take part of a previous work that's now in the public\ndomain and add original work to it and reissue it under\ntheir name and get a derivative copyright for at least the\nnew part? Now, is that authorized?\nMS. CENDALI: Yes, they absolutely can do\nthat --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. CENDALI: -- but when you have a case like\nthis which is two courts have found it was a bodily\nappropriation. The only things they changed were to --\nQUESTION: -- the State court, we're talking\nabout the district court and the court of appeals in a --\nMS. CENDALI: That's right.\nQUESTION: -- a jurisdiction that has taken a\nrather extreme view of what the Lanham Act protects.\nThat's what we're reviewing. I mean, there -- it -- it's\na means, it seems to me, of expanding copyright\nprotection.\nMS. CENDALI: Your Honor, I -- I really don't\nthink so because, again, they could have copied. The\nproblem isn't with the copying. The problem was the\ntaking credit for themselves. Going back to the\nmisattribution point on page 21 of the cert petition and\nJustice -- Judge Cooper's description of her own summary\njudgment decision, she says, by bodily appropriating the\nCrusade series and falsely identifying themselves as\nproducers of Campaigns --\nQUESTION: How does the phrase, bodily\nappropriation, fit into the Lanham Act?\nMS. CENDALI: I think it's designed as a -- as a\ntool in reverse passing off cases where you're dealing\nwith products to help assess how similar those -- those\nproducts are.\nTo go back to --\nQUESTION: Certainly there's nothing like that\nin the Lanham Act itself.\nMS. CENDALI: No, but -- but what it's trying to\ndo is to find a way of getting at the reverse passing off\nproblem. The Lanham Act doesn't provide a particular way\nof establishing confusion, deception, or --\nQUESTION: But what it -- what the Ninth Circuit\ntheory seems to me to do is to equate the likelihood of\nconsumer confusion with bodily appropriation. Now, in --\nin the case of the traffic sign, once there was no more\nprotection under law for that, some other manufacturer can\ncome in and sell it and produce it and that's a bodily\nappropriation, all right, but it wasn't treated as\nproducing consumer confusion.\nMS. CENDALI: I don't think it -- there would be\nliability for TrafFix under the Ninth Circuit test because\nit's not just bodily appropriation, but it's\nmisattribution. And as I say, when you're just simply\nsaying I manufactured the product, you're not\nmisattributing it. If Dastar said, Dastar -- I\nmanufactured and distributed this product, that would not\nbe reverse passing off. They are allowed to credit\nthemselves for what they did. They just cannot credit\nthemselves for what they didn't do.\nQUESTION: What -- Ms. Cendali, how far back do\nyou go? I mean, my problem with your interpretation of\nthe word origin -- it seems to me a very good cut-off\npoint means origin means who's selling it, who -- who\nproduced the physical thing. Now, you -- you don't want\nto limit it to that. You want to say it also includes\nwhat the physical thing contains if it's a -- if it's an\nintellectual matter.\nBut why do you cut it off at the last copyright\nowner? I mean, suppose the cassette contained Carmen\nJones. Okay? Why -- why -- would I have to identify not\nonly whoever was the author of the derivative work, Carmen\nJones, Harry Belafonte -- I don't know who did it. Would\nI also have to identify Bizet as -- as the, you know,\nthe -- the author of the original idea, plus the unknown\nFrenchman who wrote the novel from whom Bizet got the --\ngot the idea?\nMS. CENDALI: Absolutely not, Your Honor.\nThere --\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMS. CENDALI: Because --\nQUESTION: Why -- why do you arbitrarily say,\nyou know, you go back to the last copyright owner?\nMS. CENDALI: It has nothing to do with who is\nthe copyright owner or not. It's distinct from copyright.\nThe issue is and the only issue a court needs to decide in\nthese cases is does the person claiming a credit for\nthemselves --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMS. CENDALI: -- was that accurate. So if the\nperson --\nQUESTION: Okay. But may I ask what difference\nwould it make if the person claiming the credit, instead\nof claiming for himself, said, developed by an unknown\ngenius --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- when he knows it was developed by\nyou? That would be equally misleading. And would it be\ncovered?\nMS. CENDALI: I'm -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: The representation is not I developed\nit.\nMS. CENDALI: Right.\nQUESTION: I know you developed it. What I --\nwhat I represent is it was developed by a brilliant third\nparty whose name I'm not going to disclose. Would that be\nalso actionable?\nMS. CENDALI: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Why not? It's the same -- it's the\nsame impact on you. It fails to give you credit for what\nyou did.\nMS. CENDALI: But again, the issue isn't giving\nus credit. The -- the danger here is them taking the\ncredit, them taking it --\nQUESTION: Well, but what does it matter whether\nthey take the credit for themselves or -- or for Thomas\nEdison or some third party that everybody assumes really\nis the genius here? It's false in both cases.\nMS. CENDALI: You're -- you're right. If -- if\nI understand what you're saying is if someone mislabels a\nproduct in a false way as to what the origin of that\nproduct is --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. CENDALI: -- that is -- that I believe is\nactionable under the Lanham Act, and I think it should be.\nQUESTION: Even you didn't have a copyright.\nAnd that would apply even if you had no copyright on the\nproduct, just -- just --\nMS. CENDALI: Copyright really has nothing to do\nwith -- with this case. They're separate causes of action\nfor separate purposes --\nQUESTION: Does it have to be a deliberate or\ncould be a mistake? Suppose the person thought the third\nparty did it and he was wrong. He said this was really\nwritten by William Shakespeare and it was written by Joe\nSmith. Would that also be actionable?\nMS. CENDALI: If it was -- if it was a mistake,\nit may be false or misleading, but there wouldn't be\nany -- the damage is likely to be very different if there\nwas a mistake.\nQUESTION: Why wouldn't the damage be exactly\nthe same? You didn't get credit for something you\ndeveloped.\nMS. CENDALI: But again, it's not the -- to go\nback, Your Honor, it's not the giving us credit. It's\nsimply the injury lies from someone taking the credit for\nthemselves, for a company such as Dastar with no\nexperience in the video business to suddenly in 3 months,\nat the investment of $4,000, be able to produce a 7-hour\nvideo tape that it can represent to the world and use to\njump start its video business and sell 150 other boxed\nsets in competition with our client.\nQUESTION: Well, that's certainly -- it may be\nunfair competition, but I'm not sure that it has anything\nto do with confusion.\nLet me -- may I ask you a different kind of\nquestion? I thought, in answer to a question I put to you\nearlier, that you might be suggesting -- you did not come\nout and say it, but I thought you might be suggesting that\nthere would be a different kind of analysis, depending on\nwhether we were talking about an object like the sign on\nthe two springs, on the one hand, and an object with\nintellectual content on the other.\nYou said to me -- I -- I said, you know, they --\nif they don't like what they get, they will know that\nDastar is to blame. And your answer was, no, they won't\nbecause they won't know whether Dastar copied or Fox or\nFox copied Dastar. And therefore Fox will suffer because\nthere is confusion and Fox will get hurt. And -- and that\nseems to be a distinction based on the fact that you're\nbuying intellectual content as opposed simply to buying a\nsign that either stays up or it doesn't stay up. Is -- is\nthat an argument that -- that you would make?\nMS. CENDALI: Well, yes, in part, in the sense\nthat certainly when someone buys a creative work knowing\nthe author is important to the person. If you like a Tom\nClancy novel, you'll buy another Tom Clancy novel.\nQUESTION: No, but I mean, that's important to\nme, but I thought your argument was that the original\nproducer is -- is, in fact, going to be hurt by the\nconfusion because maybe the original producer will be\nblamed for the fact that there are these two identical\nintellectual products on the market.\nMS. CENDALI: Yes. That's exactly right.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, what happens in the\ncase -- what would happen in the case in -- in which we --\nwe start out with -- with Fox marketing its -- its series\nand they call it Crusade in Europe, just -- just as\nthey -- they labeled the original TV program, and Dastar\ncomes out with a -- with a series which is identical to\nit, again, copyright has expired? Dastar comes out with a\nseries that is identical to it and calls it War and simply\nsays at the bottom of -- of the cassette, cassette\nmanufactured by Dastar. Is there a Lanham Act violation\nthen? There is no claim that Dastar produced anything.\nIs there a Lanham Act violation then?\nMS. CENDALI: There would not be a false\ndesignation of origin claim under (a)(1)(A). It's --\nbecause -- because Dastar is not representing itself to be\nthe -- the creator.\nitself --\nQUESTION: But the consumer would be just as mad\nand -- I suppose, and there would be a danger even in the\nsecond case of Fox being blamed for the identity of these\ntwo products.\nMS. CENDALI: But there might -- there would be,\nhowever, I believe in that scenario a claim under\n(a)(1)(B) of the Lanham Act for falsely describing the\nnature of the product. As -- as the cases cited in our\nbrief --\nQUESTION: No, but in my second example, they\ndidn't falsely describe it. They just said, cassette\nproduced by Dastar.\nMS. CENDALI: Only -- that was true from the\npurposes of origin, and I'm saying there wouldn't be an\norigin claim.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. CENDALI: But with regard to the title, for\nthe reasons discussed in the Second Circuit cases, the new\nAmerican Library cases, when someone comes up with a\ncreative work, and puts a title on it, inherent in that\nuse is the idea that -- that this --\nQUESTION: Any change in title is therefore a\ndeception.\nMS. CENDALI:\ncases said, so to the --\nQUESTION: It's a deception in the sense that\nit's an implicit denial of the identity.\nMS. CENDALI: That's right --\nQUESTION: Yes, okay.\nMS. CENDALI: -- and so therefore, I think that\nwould be a separate issue. And that's why as consumers,\nwe all know when we look at a book and we check to see,\nyou know, if it was the same Agatha Christie book\npublished under a different title. And that's an example\nwhere disclaimers are not very difficult for people to\ndeal with in -- in reality, and something that consumers\nall can expect.\nQUESTION: Ms. Cendali, could you describe to us\nprecisely what it is that Dastar could represent? It has\nthis cassette that it's selling, and you said that they\ncan't say produced by Dastar and not say Fox. What\nexactly could they say? You don't question that they\ncould copy word for word what's in the public domain. In\npackaging it, what could they say?\nMS. CENDALI: Probably the easiest thing for\nthem to have done would have been to have copied it down\nto the last iota of the frame and simply called it and\nsaid, manufactured and distributed by Dastar. That would\nnot have been a problem under the Lanham Act or the -- or\nthe Copyright Act if -- but for the fact that the work is\nnot truly in public domain.\nIf they had want -- they could have also said,\nnew credits created by Dastar. They could have accurately\ncredited themselves for that.\nThey could have chosen not to credit anybody.\nThere's no requirement of credit.\nOr they could have given credit to everyone.\nThey could have listed the original creditors and they\ncould have -- creators, and they could have added their\nname on it.\nAll of these things they could have done which\nwould have protected the consumer. The consumer would\nhave known what he or she was getting and also not usurped\nfor themselves unjustly in an unjust enrichment way the\ngood will to which they do not deserve. This is --\nQUESTION: You haven't had time to address the\ndamages aspect of it, and if you're right that what went\nwrong here was not the copying -- they were free to\ncopy --\nMS. CENDALI: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Then -- and the only thing that was\nwrong was that they -- the attribution of creator.\nMS. CENDALI: The misattribution, yes, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: Why should they get the profits of\nDastar when -- when all they did wrong -- I mean, did --\ncopying the pages, copying the cassettes was fine. It\nseems to me to -- to have that large disgorgement of\ndamages is a misfit.\nMS. CENDALI: For several reasons, Your Honor.\nFirst, the -- what they -- the disgorgement is the normal\nremedy in cases like this because it's very difficult to\nestablish actual damages of -- of any type.\nThe statute is premised and works this way.\nYou -- you establish your entitlement to profits. In\nother words, the plaintiff just simply, once they show\nliability, needs to show what their -- that they are --\nwhat the sales were, and then the burden is on Dastar to\ncome forward and establish what -- what deductions should\nbe from that. Deductions have included the ability to\nargue apportionment, that only some of the sales should be\nattributed to the infringement, for example.\nQUESTION: Yes, but can I interrupt with --\nwith -- you got double profits in this case, didn't you?\nMS. CENDALI: Yes, we did. The court had --\nQUESTION: And wasn't the theory of that to\ndeter new violations, which I find strange when there's an\ninjunction against new violations.\nMS. CENDALI:\nthe -- they -- this was undisputed. This was the first of\n150 videos. And as Judge Posner in the Louis Vuitton\nopinion, discussed in our brief, discusses the enhanced\ndamages, and, in fact, damages of any type, are\nparticularly proper in cases such as this where there's a\nrisk of surreptitious infringement. And it's not easy to\ndetect reverse passing off.\nYou could easily have a situation where someone\nwould rather -- a rational, economic actor would rather\nlose the profits on a particular item if -- if they can\nget their entire stream of -- of business going forward.\nThis is just such a case because this was their first\nvideo. They -- they were able to use this to get instant\nlegitimacy in the video business, and get -- the injury to\nus isn't just with regard to this product, but the injury\nfor us is the entire future diversion of sales that\nthey've been able to get by suddenly using Twentieth\nCentury Fox's work to march into the video business and\nget profits time immemorial.\nThat is why Congress has enacted the kind of\ndamages provisions it has under the Lanham Act which I\nthink are singularly suited for just this type of case\nwhere it's difficult to show actual damages in any given\nway.\nI'll note, though, that the court in our case\ndid specifically find that we did suffer actual damages\nand they did not appeal from that. The -- the record\nis -- is clear and they're bound with it, that we lost\nsales and that we also lost good will. They have not\nappealed from that. The court did not quantify that in\nany way, but the court then went on to award us profits\nand, in her discretion, to award us double profits. She\nwas using her discretion. She could have awarded treble\nprofits, but she chose in the -- in the principles of\nequity to make a rational decision as befitting the facts\nof this case.\nAnd I -- she also had the opportunity, after a\ndamages trial, to see the demeanor in each of everyone of\nthe witnesses and to assess the credibility of their\nvarious statements, and I'm sure she factored that into\nher analysis as well.\nAnd I think that the award should be upheld and\nwe hope that the Court will affirm summary judgment. I\nnote that even though the Ninth Circuit opinion was -- was\nshort, given the fact it was a summary unpublished\nopinion, my understanding is that this Court has de novo\nreview and has the ability, if it so chooses, to affirm\nthe district court's opinion on any fact in the record.\nWe think that the record amply supports the fact\nthat there was reverse passing off here.\naction. I'm not aware of any court to ever suggest a\nreading of the Lanham Act that reads reverse passing off\nout of the Lanham Act the way that the Solicitor General\nand Dastar urges here. I'm not aware of a single court to\never make that suggestion. It just doesn't make sense in\nlight of the plain language of the Lanham Act. It doesn't\nmake sense in light of the fact that, as this Court again\nhas recognized in Two Pesos, the '88 amendments were only\ndesigned to codify existing law. They weren't entitled --\nintended to make any change, and there was absolutely no\nsuggestion anywhere that anyone ever thought that reverse\npassing off should be eliminated. It's --\nQUESTION: Did the disclaimer or the\nacknowledgement have to be on the package or just in the\nforewords -- or on the film, just in the screen credits?\nMS. CENDALI: The disclaimer -- I'm sorry, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: If -- if Dastar had done what you say\nthey're required to do, would it have sufficed if they put\nthe information just on the screen credits, or does it\nhave to be on the package that the consumer buys?\nMS. CENDALI: Well, I think it -- probably on\nthe package the consumer buys it should have said,\nmanufactured and distributed by Dastar.\nQUESTION:\npackage, then there's --\nMS. CENDALI: And --\nQUESTION: -- then there's a cause of action\neven if it's on the screen credits?\nMS. CENDALI: No. I think that if the\ncredits -- if our credits are on the inside and not on the\noutside, they wouldn't need to put a disclaimer probably\non the -- on the outside. In other words --\nQUESTION: But the buyer doesn't -- the buyer\nhas already bought it by the -- I mean, the screen\ncredits, you know, you're going to the refrigerator or\nreading cert petitions or something.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: No one -- no one looks at --\nMS. CENDALI: Well, that -- well, that's why the\nouter packaging has to be correct. All I'm saying is that\nif they simply put on the outer packaging manufactured and\ndistributed by Dastar, they wouldn't need to have a\ndisclaimer. If on -- if on the inside they were doing\nsomething different, or if they --\nQUESTION: Again, I -- I'm bothered. It doesn't\nseem to me this is for the protection of the consumer at\nall. I -- I understand what you're telling me about the\nact.\nMS. CENDALI:\nCourt in Qualitex and other decisions have said, a\nconsumer -- and Colgate-Palmolive -- has the right to know\nwhen they buy something, even if it's a capricious reason,\nyou know, who they're getting it from and they should have\nthe right to base their future purchasing decisions based\non accurate information. Here Dastar took that right from\nthe consumer. A consumer, if they liked Campaigns in\nEurope, they may go out --\nQUESTION: Yes, but if that's right, there's a\nduty to disclose the true producer then. That's your\nposition.\nMS. CENDALI: No. You would think it could be,\nbut it doesn't have to be.\nQUESTION: Well, if you're saying they have a\nright to know that, there must be a duty to disclose.\nMS. CENDALI: No. Only that they had the right\nnot to know what's false. In other words, the law could\ngo so far --\nQUESTION: Well, that's a very lesser right than\nthe one you were just describing --\nMS. CENDALI: I appreciate that, but -- but\nat -- at a minimum a consumer should not have false\ninformation.\nAnd again, as I come back to where I started,\nthat's what this is about.\nwith the Court. I invite the Court to -- to look at them.\nAnd you will see how deceptive they are on the inside and\non the outside and how going back to the -- my -- the\nfather getting the -- the Christmas and birthday presents\nthat are identical, which is a very real possibility, that\nis not a happy situation for the consumer. Congress put\nin the competitor the -- the private attorney general role\nto stop it.\nAnd I note, moreover, that this was very\ntargeted act -- misconduct on their part. Before they\nreleased Campaigns in Europe, they saw in a video catalog\nthat Crusade in Europe in a boxed set was for sale. They\ndidn't care. They targeted the competition and they\ncontinued.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Cendali.\nMr. Gerber, you have 5 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. GERBER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GERBER: I have two short points.\nNumber one, Ms. Cendali contends that there is\nno textual support in the section of the Lanham Act at\nissue, 41(a)(1)(A), supporting our and the SG's\ninterpretation of origin and excluding the authorship\nconcept. I would suggest that she's wrong.\nThe textual support is the word origin. Unlike\nthe Copyright Act, which uses the word author, the Patent\nAct, which uses the word inventor, the Lanham Act uses a\ndifferent word and the word is origin. And that is\ncompletely in accord with this Court's jurisprudence. I\nthink perhaps as Justice Souter had suggested, the -- the\npurpose from a policy perspective is to render efficient\npurchasing decisions, as this Court stated in Qualitex.\nQUESTION: And you -- you would stand by that\nfor forward --\nMR. GERBER: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: -- causes of action --\nMR. GERBER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- as well as -- as well as reverse.\nMR. GERBER: Yes.\nQUESTION: So that if I sold a cassette that I\nphysical manufactured and I advertised it as being Carmen\nJones, the original MGM production, and in fact it was The\nCapitol Steps, there wouldn't be any -- there wouldn't be\nany Lanham Act cause of action.\nMR. GERBER: I think that is forward passing\noff. I may be --\nQUESTION: That's what I'm saying. That's\nforward passing off, and you would say that since origin\nmeans what you say it means, I've manufactured the piece\nof plastic, there's no -- there's no cause of action under\nthe Lanham Act.\nMR. GERBER: Oh, excuse me. Yes.\nQUESTION: I mean, he who says A must say B,\nright?\nMR. GERBER: The -- the answer under the\nspecific, myopic section we're looking at that it is\ncorrect. That would not be assertable.\nIt would be redressable under, arguably,\nsubsection (B) and we may differ from the SG with respect\nto commercial advertising and promotion and whether a\npoint of sale labeling qualifies.\nAnd under a lot of consumer protection statutes\nin the States as well as the Federal Trade Act, the -- the\nsecond point that I promised responds, I believe, to\nJustice O'Connor. I wanted to add to the answer to the\nquestion yes, this would be a copyrightable derivative\nwork, the observation that the copyright defines proper\ncredits for derivative works. It tells owners of\nderivative works who may be designated as the copyright\nproprietor, and the law there is that the owner of a\nderivative work, such as Dastar, may use its name. It\ndoesn't have to refer to the names of owners of\npreexisting works. So what we have with the suggestion of\nrespondents is a kind of dual series of credits, proper\ncredits under the Copyright Act, and then authorial\ncredits.\nI -- I would suggest another example in response\nto Justice Scalia's question, it can become quite\nburdensome. You know, for a very highly complex,\niterative product like a car, you might have 300 pages of\ncredits in the owner's manual before you even get to how\ndo you turn on the key under the alternative universe of\ncredits that is completely different from the derivative\nwork credits required by the Copyright Act.\nUnless the Court has further questions, then --\nQUESTION: Well, if you have a minute, would you\naddress Ms. Cendali's argument that there is significance\nwhen a product has intellectual content and there is\nduplication because then the confusion may very well,\nindeed, redound to the -- to the original -- to the\noriginator of the product? The consumer doesn't know who\nto blame, so the originator of the product may well be\nhurt. What is your response to that argument?\nMR. GERBER: I'm not sure I -- I'm recalling the\nexample completely. If I get it, the consumer does know\nwho to blame. It has the --\nQUESTION: No. Her -- her point is you got --\nyou got two sets of videos out. One has got Dastar on it\nsaying, in effect, it's ours.\nCrusade in Europe saying Fox. The consumer is mad because\nthe consumer has both. The consumer doesn't know who to\nblame, so the consumer blames both. What's the response\nto that argument?\nMR. GERBER: I'm not sure I will buy into that\nconsequence. Where both parties state their names as\nmanufacturer, the consumer could be quite happy. He could\nsay Dastar's cost one-fifth of what Fox's did and\nrecommend it to all of his friends. So while there might\nbe confusion in the literal sense, it might actually be\nsalutary. And the efficiency of that type of consumer\ndecision is really what putting the name of the\nmanufacturer on enables the consumer to do. It renders\nthe transactions efficient.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Gerber.\n"
