PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe fundamental question in this case is whether\nthe common law doctrine of equivalence between defendant\nnegligence and plaintiff negligence applies under the\nFELA. The doctrine of equivalence is, I think, most\nclearly stated in the Restatement (Second) of Torts,\nwhich is reproduced on page 19 of our blue brief in the\nmiddle paragraph. And I think it is worth taking a\nsecond to read it.\nThe rules which determine the causal relation\nbetween a plaintiff's negligent conduct and the harm\nresulting to him are the same as those determining the\ncausal relation between the defendant's negligent conduct\nand resulting harm to others. That is a principle of law\nthat has been in effect long before the Federal Employers\nLiability Act was enacted. It is obviously a restatement\nof the law in 1965, and it is an absolutely clear\nstatement of the law as it applies today.\nThere is nothing in the Federal Employers\nLiability Act that remotely modifies the doctrine of\nequivalence. The two provisions, section 51 talks about\nnegligence resulting from -- or negligence in whole or in\npart. And section 53, which describes the contributory\nnegligence portion or comparative negligence talks about\nnegligence attributable to. None of that deviates at all\nfrom any kind of common law doctrines. Negligence\ninherently calls for an analysis of proximate causation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except that the -- what was it,\nthe Rogers case, which said that the -- well, you debate\nwhether it said that, but let's assume that it said that\nthe rule of proximate causality doesn't apply to the\nnegligence of the defendant.\nThe basis for that holding was that in whole or in\npart language which is used for the negligence of the\ndefendant, but not used for the contributory negligence.\nSo if you believe that that case was at least decided for\nthe right reason, it seems to me there's a good argument\nthat it changed it for the one, but not for the other.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, even if that were true, we\nwould still, of course, be entitled to -- I mean, it\ndoesn't change the doctrine of equivalence. It doesn't\nsay that we're not entitled to the same rule with respect\nto the -- our clients --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But nobody does --\nMR. PHILLIPS: The plaintiff would be. That\ndoctrine is unaffected by that holding. Now, I'd like\nto take issue with the interpretation of Rogers, if you\nwant, at this point. But it seems to me the doctrine of\nequivalence is fundamentally different from the doctrine\nof proximate causation. And therefore, you can change one\nwithout affecting the other one whatsoever.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, the fundamental\nproblem, at least for me, in this case is that there was\nno objection at all at trial to the instruction that the\njudge gave on negligence. There was an instruction\nrequested by the defendant on contributory negligence,\nwhich read, \"such negligence of plaintiff contributed in\nwhole or in part to cause his injury.\" That was the\nonly instruction objected to, because the refusal to\ngive that instruction. But you seem to be using that as\na lever to attack the instruction on negligence to which\nno objection was made.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's not our attack, Justice\nGinsburg. Our objection, which is reproduced in 28A of\nthe cert -- of the petition's appendix, that says -- and\nI think the current MAI instruction has a different\ncausation standard for comparative fault, meaning that\nunder Missouri's rules, we must prove that such\nnegligence of plaintiff directly contributed to the cause\n-- to cause the injury. And that misstates the law,\nbecause of the doctrine of equivalence.\nThat's our initial argument, is that no matter how\nyou analyze this, whether you do it from a proximate\ncause or a slightest cause standard as the appropriate\nway to evaluate our negligence, that same standard has to\nbe applied in evaluating the plaintiff's negligence.\nThat's the core doctrine. That's what we sought\ncertiorari on.\nThe argument with respect to Rogers was not an\nargument we put into this case, Justice Ginsburg. It's\nan argument that the Respondent put into this case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I take it you would be satisfied\n-- not wholly satisfied, but substantially satisfied if\nwe said, yeah, we accept the doctrine of equivalence, and\nwe think the instruction on contributory negligence was\ncorrect. Because that would mean in the next case, you\nwould get a proximate cause instruction on defendant's\nnegligence.\nMR. PHILLIPS: We would regard that as certainly\nat least half a loaf, maybe more than half a loaf. But\nat the end of the day, I think the right answer in this\ncase is that the Court ought to go ahead and decide\nwhether or not Rogers really did work a sea change in the\nlaw.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If we came out the way I just\ndescribed --\nMR. PHILLIPS: You wouldn't have to address that\nissue.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We wouldn't have to.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely don't have to address\nthat issue. On the other hand, the question is squarely\npresented. And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I thought you argued the\nRogers standard was a correct standard in the Missouri\ncourt?\nMR. PHILLIPS: We clearly did that, Justice\nKennedy. And we didn't raise -- we are not here\ncomplaining about Rogers as an argument for why we\nshouldn't be liable. That's not our -- we're not\ncriticizing that.\nWhat we're saying is, in response to the\nRespondent's argument which seeks to undermine the\ndoctrine of equivalence based on an overreading, I would\nargue, of Rogers, that that interpretation is incorrect.\nAnd if we're right that that interpretation is incorrect,\nwe would win on the doctrine of equivalence for two\ndifferent reasons.\nThe first one that Justice Souter described. And\nthe second one would be that to the extent that there's\nany equivalence, there's no problem here because\nproximate cause is required in every case. And we think\nthat that's an issue that the Court doesn't have to\ndecide, but certainly could. I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, the defendant\nrequested a charge on contributory negligence that read,\n\"such negligence of plaintiff contributed in whole or in\npart to cause his injuries.\" You didn't want the direct\nrelationship, you didn't ask for that. You asked for one\nthat said, \"such negligence of plaintiff contributed in\nwhole or in part to his injury.\" Now you are saying that\nthat was -- what you asked for was an incorrect charge.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, what we're saying, Justice\nGinsburg, is that we were entitled to the same -- if they\nwere going to use slight negligence with respect to our\nnegligence, then with respect to the plaintiff's\nnegligence, we were entitled to slight negligence as\nwell.\nThat's our fundamental argument. That's the issue\nwe have put on the table. And candidly, I don't think\nthere's an answer to that that's been offered in this\ncase, other than a harmless error argument, which I think\nis candidly without substance.\nThe issue, then, is whether in evaluating the\ndoctrine of equivalence, do you want to then entertain\nthe plaintiff's or the Respondent's counter argument,\nwhich is that somehow Rogers requires this fundamental\nchange, and indeed overrules the doctrine of equivalence\nas it applies to FELA.\nAnd I would say, one, Rogers doesn't speak to the\ndoctrine of equivalence at all. And, two, to the extent\nit does speak to it, it was never meant to change the\nfundamental rule with respect to proximate causation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except we've rejected petitions\nfor certiorari on that issue at least a couple of times.\nEleven circuits are in agreement as to what Rogers\nrequired. You --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, at least one circuit clearly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you really expect to get five\nvotes for the railroad on this, what would be a massive\nchange of what is assumed to be the law for, what, 50\nyears?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the -- well, the\nanswer is yes, of course, I expect to get five votes for\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you were wise enough not to\nask for that.\n(Laughter)\nMR. PHILLIPS: But you know, the basic -- the\npoint here is that if you look at the decisions that have\nanalyzed this Court's opinion in Rogers, I don't think\nany of them has analyzed it with much care. And the\nreality is the Third Circuit has analyzed this case with\ncare, and reached the opposite conclusion.\nWe think there is a split in the circuits. And at\nsome point, if not through this vehicle to address that\nissue, then through another vehicle to address that\nissue. But, yes, it seems reasonably clear that, first\nof all, there were at least 20 decisions of this Court\ndealing not only with the sufficiency evidence, but also\nwith the adequacy of the jury instructions prior to\nRogers that refer specifically to proximate causation.\nThere is nothing in the statute that remotely\nmeant to change that. There is nothing that's been\nidentified in that context. It is at least clear to me,\nand I hope clear to five of you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Rogers said, in whole or in part.\nNow, I agree with you, that I don't see how that does it.\nBut Rogers said that it did it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But what Rogers saying in whole or\nin part eliminated was the specific proximate causation\nstandard existing in Missouri. And Missouri's proximate\ncause standard talked about sole causation. And this\nCourt said, no, in whole or in part means sole causation\ncan not be the right standard for proximate cause.\nThe Court was not asked to decide, and I don't\nthink it did decide, that proximate causation, as it is\ntraditionally understood, was also thrown out the door,\nor more fundamentally, that you can never ask for a jury\ninstruction that calls for proximate causation to be\ngiven to both parties -- I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Phillips, I may be\nlost a bit here. But I mean, which -- I'm looking at the\ninstructions that were given. And it seems to me it is\nhard to take issue with the instruction on the railroad's\npart because it tracks the statutory language. The\nstatute says in whole or in part, and the instruction\nsays in whole or in part.\nSo if you're pushing the doctrine of equivalence,\nyour objection seems to be to the directly contributed\nlanguage with respect to the employee, the plaintiff.\nNow, but doesn't directly contributed, isn't that a\ntypical proximate cause instruction?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, that is a typical proximate\ncause instruction, and that meant that our burden was\nheavier than the plaintiff's burden, which is why we're\nsaying that under the doctrine of equivalence, we're\nentitled to the equivalent instructions. Whatever they\nare. If it is slight cause or proximate cause.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. But on the other\nhand, you're also arguing in favor of proximate cause. You\nare saying Rogers didn't change proximate cause.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. But we are only doing that\nin response to the Respondent's argument. I'm not -- we\ndidn't bring to this Court an affirmative argument that\nsaid we are entitled to no liability because of proximate\ncause. That's not the argument we made. The argument --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How is the blue brief in\nresponse to Respondent's argument?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because if you look at the\nopposition to the cert petition, which took us to task\nfor not discussing Rogers in our petition, it says on\npage 6, \"inexplicably, petitioner does not cite, let\nalone discuss Rogers, an omission that enfeebles its\nentire discussion of FELA's causation standards.\"\nAgainst that kind of an attack, we felt it\nincumbent on us to deal with Rogers.\nJUSTICE BREYER: As we're supposed to decide the\ncase, in your view, there was instruction 13.\nInstruction 13 used the word direct.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You object to 13. You said it\nshould use the word in whole or in part.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You then argued to the lower\ncourts, 13 should use the word in whole or in part. And\nthen you say you've argued that here. So what you're\nsaying is now we're supposed to decide, should\ninstruction 13 use the word in whole or in part. That's\nwhat it is.\nI have to admit, I didn't quite get that out of\nthe blue brief. I thought you were arguing something\nelse about railroad negligence. But you're not now, you\nsay, arguing about railroad negligence. You're arguing\nabout plaintiff negligence.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, we're arguing both.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So if I reread the\nblue brief, what I'll discover on closer examination,\nthat your real objection, not responding to the other\nside, has simply been about the standard to use in\nrespect to plaintiff's contributory negligence. And what\nyou want this Court to say is, you're right about that,\nwe want the more relaxed standard used for contributory\nnegligence. End of case.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It says that in the blue brief?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, it does say that in the blue\nbrief. Because what we say is that the doctrine\nof equivalence is the principle that should apply. And\nyou know, it is not specifically before the Court whether\nthat means slight cause or proximate cause.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would say it sure is before the\nCourt, because what we are considering before the Court\nis your objection to instruction 13. And you said it\nshould use the words in whole or in part. And I have to\nadmit, I don't know why it shouldn't. But I'll have to\nask them that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's fair.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're going to say yes.\nSo all this other stuff is quite extraneous about whether\n-- the railroad standard of negligence, the railroad\nshould be in a relaxed standard of negligence, in whole\nor in part.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't know that it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Causation.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't know that it's extraneous.\nIt clearly is not something that the Court needs to\ndecide. On the other hand, it is something that the\nRespondents, to my mind at least, put into the case. And\nthen we responded, to be sure, somewhat aggressively in\nurging the Court to rethink whether Rogers was right --\nwhether Rogers really decided this issue as some courts\nof appeals have.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Perhaps my memory is faulty,\nbut as I recall your opening brief, many pages were\ndevoted to what instruction should have been given on\nrailroad negligence. You were dealing not simply with\nwhat seems to be the question presented, that is, was the\ninstruction on contributory negligence wrong, because it\nsaid -- it didn't use the in whole or in part language.\nInstead it said directly caused.\nSo that's the limit of what we can deal with,\nwhether the in whole or in part should have been in the\ncontributory negligence. But it was your brief that\nspent a lot of time talking about the proper standard for\nthe railroad's negligence.\nMR. PHILLIPS: There is no question about that,\nJustice Ginsburg. But the point is that we made both\narguments. And they are in some ways intertwined, in\npart because so much of the doctrine of equivalence\nitself is based on proximate cause as the standard. And\nso if you go back and look at all of the common law\nanalyses here, which are the predicate --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you didn't object to the\ncharge that was given on negligence. You didn't object\nto the in whole or in part. So that should be out of the\ncase.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Except to the extent that the\nRespondents are asking you to interpret Rogers as a\nmechanism for getting at the doctrine of equivalence.\nNow, it seems to me you can answer that in one of two\nways.\nYou can say simply, as I said to Justice Scalia,\nRogers doesn't speak to the doctrine of equivalence, and\ntherefore, you don't have to entertain that, you should\njust reaffirm a doctrine that every court except the\ncourts in Missouri have recognized for a very long time.\nOr alternatively, you can say, well, look, they say that\nin order to properly analyze the doctrine of equivalence,\nyou should examine whether or not Rogers worked a sea\nchange in the law.\nAnd we took them up on that argument, and said, we\ndon't think it did. And that if it didn't work a sea\nchange in the law, then there is no basis at all for\ndoubting that you would grant equivalent instructions in\nthese two cases. And that's the guidance you would give\nto the lower courts on remand. Because this case would\nhave to go back for a new trial.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're not taking them up on\nany argument when you spent half your brief arguing about\nwhat the proper standard was for the railroad's\nnegligence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I would add to that that we\ndon't usually look at a BIO to see the issues that the\nPetitioner is presenting.\nMR. PHILLIPS: And you know, Justice Kennedy, I\nunderstand that. But the reality is we raised the\ndoctrine of equivalence as our question presented. The\nother side raises and uses a substantial amount of its\npages for the issue of the meaning of Rogers. We answer\nthat in the reply brief. The Court grants certiorari.\nWe decided under those circumstances that the sensible\nway to proceed was to address the Rogers issue.\nNow, to be sure, I suppose we could have said,\nhere's -- section one is the doctrine of equivalence.\nThat's a 10 page brief. Maybe the better way to do it is\njust write a 15 page brief, wait for their 47 page brief\non Rogers, and then 20 pages on Rogers.\nBut we anticipated that they were going to do\nprecisely what they did, which is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you would have us\nannounce a decision on the doctrine of equivalence\nwithout saying which way it should be made equivalent?\nRaising the railroad's standard or lowering the\nemployee's?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, because -- courts of appeals\nhave been doing that for years. There have been a lot --\nyou know, a lot of them assume that there's a lower\nstandard, and they say that the doctrine of equivalence\nrequires that if the plaintiff gets to go with slight\ncause, then the defendant gets slight cause. So that's a\nruling that's been rendered for years and years.\nIs that the most sensible way? I don't know. I\nthink it would make sense for this Court to address the\nmore fundamental issue of Rogers. Because I think it is\nan important issue that needs to be decided. I don't\nthink the Court needs to decide it. I do think it has\nbeen thoroughly vetted for the Court on both sides, and\nit would certainly provide significant guidance to the\nlower courts.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, may I ask you this\nquestion. Assuming you're right on the doctrine of\nequivalence and you're wrong on proximate cause, for the\nmoment. Now, you said earlier in your argument, it is\nperfectly clear there was no harmless error here.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seemed to me that a possible\ninterpretation of the record -- and I'd like you to comment\nof the record -- is that the jury either believed the one --\none truck driver or the other. And that the direct causation\nthing really didn't have an impact on the calculation of\ndamages.\nAnd I was going to ask you to comment on that and\nto tell me whether during the argument of the case before\nthe jury, did the plaintiff's lawyer argue, in effect,\nthat he had -- the railroad has a much heavier burden of\nproving a causation than we do?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Let me take the first question\nfirst, and then I'll address the second one. There were\nthree theories that the plaintiff put forward of the\nnegligence of the railroad. Not just that the one driver\ndrove the other driver off the side of the road. There\nwas also a claim that the road wasn't constructed\nproperly, and there was a claim that he wasn't given\nadequate safety instructions.\nAnd there's no way, given that this was a general\nverdict, to remotely figure out which of those theories\nwas the one the jury thought was correct, and how that\ntheory might line up with a causation theory, based on\nthe plaintiff's own particular view and the defendant's\narguments in this particular case.\nSo it is not as cut and dried as he said, he said,\nand that's it. They were more theories in it. And you\nknow, if you accept the idea that jury instructions\ncount, and there's clearly a very different burden that's\nimposed on one as opposed to the other, then it seems to\nme the answer is there's no way for the Court to make a\nharmless error determination.\nIt is also a question of State law. It ought to\nbe decided by the Missouri courts in the first instance\nin any event, I would think, rather than this Court\ntrying to sort through the record.\nWith respect to the argument at the close of\nthe case, I don't remember any specific arguments that\neither side made with respect to the burdens, because the\njury instructions were what they were. And I think each\nside was saying, you know, we really didn't do anything\nwrong. And so that's basically the way that it was\npresented.\nBut I think given the way the jury instructions\nplayed out, that there's no way at this time to\nunscramble that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think I'm seeing now, I think\nthe structure of your brief is -- perhaps a gloss put on\nit, but saying this: Look, we objected to the\ncontributory negligence instruction on the ground that it\ncouldn't be different from the direct instruction -- from\nthe railroad instruction. And we said they should be the\nsame and they should both be in whole or in part.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And we now want you to say that\nthe refusal of the court to do that was wrong, because it\nviolated the equivalence. But as soon as you do that,\nyou're going to have to think about what the right\nstandard should be for a new trial.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if you stop there, probably,\nthey will put the in whole or in part, but that's not the\nright standard.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if you really think about it,\nyou will see that the one we didn't ask for, but the one\nthat the court gave, is the right standard and should\nhave been given in the other case, too. Now, we wouldn't\nhave to say that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you're saying unless you say\nthat, you're not going to give proper instruction to what\nhappens in the future. Now --\nMR. PHILLIPS: You know, that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now let's think back for a minute\non the merits.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE BREYER: How could it be wrong? How could\nit be wrong to have instructed the jury with the in whole\nor in part language for the railroad, since that's the\nlanguage of the statute itself?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think if we were entitled\nto go back to the trial court, and if the issue was\nwhat's the proper instruction, we would have asked for\nand we should have properly received a proximate cause\ninstruction. And that's what -- that's the question that\nwill be at issue on the remand.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What possible -- you have two\nsides. One, you write a proximate cause instruction in\nwhatever language you like.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The other side submits a proposed\ninstruction with in whole or in part. I'm a trial\njudge. I've never heard of this case, kind of case\nbefore. I just was appointed. I read the statute. And\nI say, well, here, theirs says what the statute says, and\nyours doesn't. I'll play it safe. I'll go with the\nstatute. All right? Now, how could that be an error?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it is not a correct statement\nof the law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Is the answer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In other words, what the statute\nsaid it is not a correct statement of the law?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, because it doesn't adequately\nexplain to the jury what decisionmaking it has to go\nthrough in order to evaluate this case. I mean, it is\ntrue, it is not an incorrect statement in the sense that\nthere's nothing wrong with it. But it is not an adequate\nstatement because it doesn't deal, it is not sufficient,\nit doesn't deal with the proximate cause issue. I mean,\nit seems to me --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Phillips, may I interrupt on\nexactly the point that I think you're addressing with\nJustice Breyer? As I understand your argument, you're\nsaying one view of Rogers is that the in whole or in part\nlanguage eliminates the proximate cause instruction. We\nall agree that that is one view of Rogers.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it also does something else.\nAnd I don't think we disagree about that either. It\nspecifically instructs the jury that multiple causation\nmay be present. And if it is, if the defendant is at\nleast one, the source of one of those causes under Rogers\neven slightly --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- that that will suffice. The\nproblem I have with -- in a way with your response to\nJustice Breyer, and the problem that I have with the\ninstruction that your side requested on contributory\nnegligence is this: It seems to me that the in whole or\nin part language would be wrong on contributory\nnegligence, or at least it would be very misleading, for\nthe simple reason that you never get to contributory\nnegligence unless you found the defendant was negligent\nin the first place.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And therefore, if the plaintiff\nis also negligent, it will necessarily be in part. It\ncouldn't be wholly or in part. If it were wholly\nnegligent, you would never have found the defendant was\nnegligent in the first place.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that to the extent the\ninstruction addresses multiple causation, it would be\nmisleading to the jury, and it would assume a possibility\nthat couldn't happen. Therefore, if you are not going to\nmislead the jury on multiple causation when you instruct\non contributory negligence, you've got to have some other\nway of addressing the proximate cause language. Is that\nanalysis right or wrong?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think it is wrong on two\nlevels. One is, I don't know why you would need to have\nproximate cause as your fallback, the last comment you\njust made, because it seems to me if you're saying slight\ncause, which is what Missouri thinks the in whole or in\npart means, then you can just say slight cause when\nyou're describing the contributory negligence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But the instruction that your\nside asked for, as I understand it, was not a slight\ncause instruction, it was an in whole or in part\ninstruction.\nMR. PHILLIPS: What we asked for was an\nequivalence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, and that -- all right. But\nif you're asking for the in whole or in part instruction\non contributory negligence, it seems to me the judge has\ngot to have been correct in saying no to that, because to\nthe extent that it addresses multiple causation, it would\nbe addressing a problem that couldn't even occur in\ncontributory negligence which will always be in part.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That was not the basis on which the\njudge rejected it. He didn't reject it on the basis --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe that was not the\nbasis on which he rejected it, but if -- we've got to\nconsider it in deciding whether to reverse it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the point here that remains\nis we said we are entitled to an equivalent instruction.\nNow, if there's some variant of that, we could certainly\nargue about that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that's not what he said. He\nsaid equivalence instruction was not on multiple\ncausation. It was the equivalence instruction on either\nproximate cause or not proximate cause. It was the\ncausation issue, it was the proximate causation issue,\nnot the multiple causation issue that concerned you,\nright?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, that is the specific issue in\nthis case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They don't have to have\nproximate, we don't have to have proximate.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. That's our argument.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But because the\ninstruction addresses both, in one view, proximate cause\nand multiple cause, it would have been misleading so far\nas the multiple cause issue was concerned, and a request\nfor an instruction in whole or in part on contributory\nnegligence really should have been denied. Is that\ncorrect?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well -- I think -- I think the\nargument would be that that cuts it too fine, candidly.\nI think you can make an argument that what, you know,\nwhat we were entitled to was some variant. And that --\nour objection here is not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You were entitled -- your\nargument is you were entitled to an equivalent\ninstruction on the issue of the need to prove --\nMR. PHILLIPS: The slightest cause.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- proximate cause or no need to\nprove proximate cause.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's your basic argument.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's our basic argument.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. PHILLIPS: And we didn't get that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And I don't think you could have\ngotten where you want to go with the instruction that\nyour side requested, which was an in whole or in part\ninstruction. That's my only point.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it may be that the in whole\npart of this may have been slightly misleading, although\nI think you can make an argument that you can end up with\nin whole on both sides as a conceptual matter. But\nthat's not the -- that wasn't the complaint at trial. It\nwasn't the basis for the trial judge's decision, wasn't\nthe basis for the court of appeals decision.\nIf the Court wants to send it back and say, is\nthere another objection to this instruction, that's fine.\nBut it seems to me, this Court ought to address this\nissue in the way it has been presented.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was wrong with the\ninstruction, in your view of the case, that was given,\ninstruction number 13, negligence of plaintiff directly\ncontributed to cause his injuries?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because that's proximate causation.\nAnd that's higher than we were required to prove under a\ndoctrine of equivalence, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's the direct\nlanguage?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I would like to reserve the balance\nof my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Phillips.\nMs. Perry?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY L. PERRY\nON BEHALF OF THE Respondent\nMS. PERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe controlling question raised here is whether\ninstruction 13 accurately states Federal law. That's\nexactly what petitioner said in their reply brief to the\nMissouri Court of Appeals. They could not have been any\nclearer that their challenge was to instruction 13. In\nJohn versus Poulin, this Court said that State courts\nhave the authority to prescribe the rules of procedure in\ntheir courts even when Federal issues are at stake.\nThe requirements in the Missouri courts were not\ncomplied with here. No abstract question was presented.\nThe sole question presented and preserved was with\nrespect to instruction 13. And that can again be seen in\ntheir opening brief in the Missouri Court of Appeals,\nwhich specifically says the trial court erred in giving\ninstruction 13 based on MAI 32.07(b).\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is the question whether\ninstruction 13 is flawed viewed in isolation, or whether\nit is flawed when it's viewed together with the\ninstruction on employer negligence?\nMS. PERRY: It is viewed in conjunction with the\ninstruction on employer negligence, but a fixed concept\nof what it was, they did not challenge the language of\ninstruction 12. They accepted that. Holding that\nlanguage constant, what should we do to instruction 13?\nThey could have objected to instruction 12 and 13,\nand they could have said, here are a pair of instructions\nboth in proximate cause, and here are a pair of\ninstructions both in -- resulting in whole or in part,\nand then they could have preserved this issue. But they\ndid not do that. They accepted instruction 12 as a\ncorrect statement of the law, and said, now let's look at\ninstruction 13.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But do you agree that they set out\ndifferent causation standards, 12 and 13?\nMS. PERRY: Yes, they do. Rogers concluded that\n50 years ago and the courts in the Federal and State\nsystem have nearly uniformly interpreted Rogers as\nreaching that decision.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So if the causation standards are\nin fact the same, then instruction 13 is defective; isn't\nthat right?\nMS. PERRY: Yes, if you can reach that decision\nwithout interpreting instruction 12, or the propriety of\ninstruction 12, particularly since instruction 12\ncontained the exact language of the statute. Whatever\njudicial gloss has been put on that language was not told\nto the jury.\nJustice Stevens, the question you asked, whether\nthere was any argument about the different standards, the\nanswer is no. There was no argument. The only way in\nwhich the jury learned of this difference was in the\nlanguage of the instruction. And instruction 12 --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you this question, if\nI may. Perhaps I should have asked Mr. Phillips. Is\nthere such an animal as the doctrine of equivalence? I\nunderstand the restatement describes what the plaintiff's\nburden is on proving causation, and then it says the same\nrules apply to defendant's contributory negligence.\nBut that doesn't sound to me like any overriding\ndoctrine of equivalence. It just says when they wrote\nthe restatement, the rules were the same. Is there such\na thing as the doctrine of equivalence?\nMS. PERRY: There wasn't in the early 1900s for\ncertain, Your Honor, because at that time, even\npetitioners recognized the doctrine was emerging. And if\nwe look at the language of 53, it talks about the type of\ncontributory negligence that used to be a bar. And that\ncertainly was a type of contributory negligence that only\narose with the traditional proximate cause. It certainly\nwasn't on the slightest cause standard.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't there have\nto be a doctrine of equivalence when you're running a\ncomparative negligence regime? Because, you know, you\ntalk about the plaintiff's negligence causing the harm to\na certain degree and the defendant's negligence causing\nit to a certain degree. And if you're not dealing with\napples and apples, it seems to me you can't conduct the\ncomparison.\nMS. PERRY: No, Your Honor. You can conduct the\ncomparison, and it happens all the time in cases where\none party has committed intentional misconduct and\nanother party has had negligent misconduct. The\ncausation standards are different in that instance.\nThere's a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. But we're talking\nabout comparative negligence here, where there's\nnegligence on both sides. And I just don't know how you\nsay one party's 20 percent -- contributed 20 percent to\nthe harm and the other 80 percent, if you're using\ndifferent causation standards.\nMS. PERRY: Well, the causation standard is used\nto decide what negligence you use in the balance and in\nthe comparison. For example, if a party is negligent,\nbut the negligence had no causative effect, that\nnegligence falls out of the analysis.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but your example of other\ninstances including having to compare a defendant who did\nthe tort intentionally with negligent -- contributory\nnegligence, that's not what we have here. We have here a\ndifference in the causation. Intentional or\nnon-intentional has nothing to do with causation.\nBut once you say that there's a difference in the\ncausation, it seems to me you cannot compare the two.\nYou cannot compare the two sensibly, unless you are using\nthe same kind of a standard.\nI mean, let's assume that you find that the\nrailroad did not directly, but nonetheless caused the\ninjury to some extent, but the defendant was directly\ncontributory to it. What do I do? Do I add another 40\npercent to his culpability because it was -- his\ncausation was more direct than the plaintiff's causation?\nMS. PERRY: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why not?\nMS. PERRY: It just affects which negligence was\nin the balance. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, it doesn't. It certainly\nbears considerably upon the culpability of the two, it\nseems to me.\nMS. PERRY: Well, in responding -- going back to\nyour question about intentional conduct, the petitioner's\nreply brief, in fact, states that a broader range of\nharms are considered proximately caused by intentional\ntorts. So there is a different conception of proximate\ncause in that context.\nBut in any event, their merits brief consistently\nargues for a proximate cause standard. In fact, it\ncloses with that. And its criticism of instruction 13 in\nthis case was precisely that it was a proximate cause\nstandard. So if they are now before this Court asking\nfor a proximate cause standard, they conceded that\ninstruction 13 was a proximate cause standard, they in\nfact complained about it precisely because it was a\nproximate cause standard, that issue really isn't before\nthis Court anymore.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have any\nconceptual difficulty with adding in whole or in part to\ninstruction 13, which is the employee's instruction,\nbecause it's comparative negligence. It seems to me that\nnecessarily implies in whole or in part. If you can\nreduce his recovery because he's in part negligent, what\nwould be wrong with saying in whole or in part in\ninstruction 13?\nMS. PERRY: Well, I think Justice Souter hit the\nnail on the head on that one, in that it does create\nconfusion and it can mislead the jury that the railroad\nworker is responsible for other parties' culpability as\nwell. Moreover --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I thought Justice\nSouter's point was that taking it out of the railroad's\ninstruction might cause confusion because of it. But I\ndon't see how adding it to both of them when you're\ndealing with comparative negligence, and it's necessarily\nthe case that partial negligence on either of their parts\ncan enter into the verdict, I don't see how that can be\nconfusing.\nMS. PERRY: Well, in --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can answer it.\nMS. PERRY: I don't want to interrupt anybody.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Answer the question, Justice\nSouter. Yes or no.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The point that I was trying to\nmake about it being misleading is that if you use the in\nwhole or in part language for a contributory negligence\ninstruction, you are misleading the jury into thinking\nthat at least there might be whole contributory\nnegligence. There never will be. You don't get the\ncontributory negligence unless you've already found the\ndefendant was negligent, at least to some degree.\nTherefore, if the plaintiff is negligent, it can only be\nin part. That's all I was trying to say.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under that scenario, then,\nwhat objection could there be to a recognition that the\nnegligence of the plaintiff can contribute in part to the\naccident?\nMS. PERRY: If petitioner had asked for an\ninstruction that said directly contributed in part, the\ninclusion of the phrase in part there might not have any\nimpact. It could still potentially mislead the jury, but\nthey were seeking not just to add the words \"resulting in\nwhole or in part,\" but remove the word \"directly\" because\nit connoted proximate cause, and that they felt proximate\ncause was not the appropriate standard for contributory\nnegligence, even though now that is the standard that\nthey solely are seeking.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, two things you might\ncomment on. First, the in whole or in part, you might\ntake account of the fact that there are other negligent\nactors, third parties, who have contributed to the injury\nto the employee.\nSecondly, Section 53 does not contain the language\nin whole or in part.\nMS. PERRY: Absolutely, Your Honor. It does not.\nIn section --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's what Justice\nSouter has identified, right? That's not because they're\nadopting different standards.\nMS. PERRY: I disagree, Your Honor. I think it is\nbecause they are adopting different standards. The\ncontributory negligence --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you just told me, a\ngood reason for not putting in whole or in part in\ninstruction 13 is because it doesn't make sense, the\nwhole part doesn't make sense with contributory\nnegligence. That's a good reason not to put it in\nSection 53 either.\nMR. PERRY: That's one reason. But another reason\nis that it's a different standard. In Section 53,\nthey're talking about contributory negligence that was a\nbar to liability. That type of contributory negligence\nwas the kind that was more than -- it wasn't caused by\nslight causation. It required proximate cause. That was\na pretty harsh result.\nAnd it certainly didn't arise in instances where\nthe plaintiff had just had the slightest causal\nconnection. And that certainly was the conclusion in\nRogers.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, no, no. May I pick you up\non that? Because there's a point at which you and I are\ndisagreeing about Rogers. And in all candor, I think\nit's because you are ignoring one part of Rogers, and if\nI'm wrong, I want you to tell me. You quote the\nslightest bit language from Rogers on both page 26 and 33\nof your brief. And you take that as being language that\neliminates the proximate cause requirement.\nWhat you don't include in your quotation is the\nfootnote in Justice Brennan's opinion following that\nslightest cause language. And the footnote was to a\ncitation, the citation was to the Coray case. The\nopinion in Coray was written by Justice Douglas and --\nI'm sorry, Justice Black. And in the very language that\nJustice Black used, he said expressly that if proximate\ncause is shown, there can be recovery.\nNow, given the fact that in Rogers, the very\ncitation to the language which you say eliminated the\nproximate cause requirement cited a case in which\nproximate cause was part of the very sentence relied on,\nI don't see how you can read Rogers -- maybe later cases,\nbut I don't see how you can read Rogers as eliminating\nthe proximate cause requirement.\nAnd therefore, I think you have to read Rogers as\naddressing the issue of multiple causation, not proximate\ncausation. Now, am I going wrong there somewhere?\nMS. PERRY: I have two responses, Your Honor.\nFirst, Justice Brennan wrote Crane twelve years later.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Absolutely right.\nMS. PERRY: And he, you know, definitely clearly\nsaid that a railroad worker does not have to prove common\nlaw proximate causation relying on Rogers.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He did, but he was also pointing\nout, just to make it simpler, he was pointing out in\nCrane that the liability arose in Crane out of -- I\nforget the full name of it -- the Appliance Act. And the\nAppliance Act had its own set of standards. And\ntherefore, you cannot, from an Appliance Act case, you\ncannot infer anything one way or the other about the\ngeneral standard in FELA. And to make it even more\ncomplicated, as I recall, Rogers was an Appliance case,\ntoo, but he didn't get into that there.\nBut my only point is, you are right about the\ntwo Brennan opinions, Rogers and the -- Crane. But given\nthe fact that it was an Appliance case, I don't think you\ncan infer one thing or another about an ultimate FELA\nstandard in the absence of an Appliance action.\nWhat remains is that the citation in Rogers was to\nCoray, and Coray spoke about there still being proximate\ncause.\nMS. PERRY: Yes. But if we look at those earlier\ncases, particularly Coray, we can see that Rogers\narticulated what was meant by that proximate cause\nlanguage. Proximate cause is, in a sense, a label for\nscope of liability or legal cause, as the restatement\nsays. It doesn't have any singular conception. And in\nCoray, the Court found --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it is understood by\neverybody, isn't it, that at least it has the conception\nwhich is captured by using the word \"direct\" as in\ninstruction 13, and at least it has that core of meaning\nwhenever it is used, doesn't it?\nIn other words, it may not have a lot of bells and\nwhistles associated with it in the prior law, but at\nleast it requires some direct causation as opposed to\nindirect, right?\nMS. PERRY: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. And that's -- I don't know\nthat Justice Brennan's citation to Coray, or Coray's use\nof the language carries you any further than that. But\nthat's as far as Mr. Phillips wants to go.\nMS. PERRY: We don't accept that, but even if\nthat's the case, the Rogers -- the parties to Rogers\nimmediately interpreted that decision as affecting\nproximate cause. Twelve years later, this Court did say\nthat in Crane. The lower courts have uniformly, nearly\nuniformly interpreted Rogers in a certain way. And at\nthis point, stare decisis suggests that this Court should\nnot overrule.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That may be. That may be. But\nit seems to me that that's a different argument from\nsaying Rogers requires it, because I don't think you can\nget that out of Rogers.\nMS. PERRY: Well, and I also think, though, that\nby lightening -- by saying the slightest cause possible\nor, you know, a slight cause would create liability, that\ndoes affect proximate cause.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have to say\nthat. I mean, you know, when in doubt, we ought to\nfollow the words of the statute. And so whole or in part\nmakes sense with the railroad, but directly doesn't\nappear in Section 53. Why don't we just -- why shouldn't\nthe instruction just say, \"such negligence of the\nplaintiff contributed to cause his injury.\" It's not\ngoing to be a complete bar because we know the\nimmediate -- the next instruction talks about reducing\nthe award by the amount of the negligence. Why wouldn't\nthat be preferable to introducing extraneous terms?\nMS. PERRY: Because Section 53 refers to\ncontributory negligence that created a bar. And that was\nthe type of negligence that required proximate cause.\nMoreover, the type of instruction you are positing is not\nat all what petitioner requested in this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no, but he requested\nthat the instructions be the same, and the directly is\nwhat causes the problem, and directly doesn't appear in\nthe statute.\nMS. PERRY: But under Missouri procedures, you\nhave to be clear in the nature of your objection, and the\nobjection was that we want the same language, we want the\nlanguage resulting in whole or in part.\nAnd out of respect for the State courts and their\nright to create the rules that govern in those courts,\nthat was not satisfactory under Missouri rules. Missouri\nrules also have specific requirements for what you have\nto do in the court of appeals. There's a \"Point Relied\nOn\" which is the argument heading in the brief, and it's\nrequired by Rule 84.04. And it sets forth a very\nspecific format, and it's supposed to start with \"The\ntrial court erred in,\" and then you give your reasons.\nAnd it says that negligence -- it erred in\ninstructing the jury to find plaintiff negligent only if\nit concluded that his negligence directly contributed to\ncause his injury, rather than cause his injury in whole\nor in part.\nYou know, there is no issue that was preserved in\nthe Missouri courts other than that challenge. Cook\nversus Caldwell which we cite in our brief, in Missouri,\nnot only do you have to object, but you have to keep\nconsistent with the basis of the objection. You can't\njust object to instruction 13 on one ground, go up to the\ncourt of appeals, and raise a completely different\nchallenge to instruction 13. You have to stay\nconsistent. And out of respect --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think they raised\nan objection based on the doctrine of equivalence?\nMS. PERRY: That was a justification for rewriting\ninstruction 13 to include the words \"resulting in whole\nor in part.\" I do not think they raised an abstract\nargument about equivalency; that in order to do that,\nthey would have had to object to instruction 12 and\ninstruction 13, because equivalency in the abstract would\nrequire modification of both instructions, and they\nclearly chose to accept the language of instruction 12\nand only object to instruction 13.\nSo no, not in the abstract, it hasn't been raised.\nIt was a justification for one particular result, and\nthat was a result that would have modified instruction\n13. And in a particular way, too, modified it in a way\nof including the words \"resulting in whole or in part.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: I guess they want to make the\nargument now, whether they did or not, that if we look at\nSection 53, which I think is the part dealing with\ncontributory negligence. I don't see anything else. It\ndoesn't speak of causation at all.\nMS. PERRY: Exactly, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It just says if there's some\ncontributory negligence, the damages will be diminished\naccording to the negligence attributable to the employee.\nSo I take it their argument was, maybe with\nhindsight, Judge, don't give this direct language,\nbecause nothing requires it. And since, other things\nbeing equal, nothing requires it, you ought to give the\nsame language you gave for the other side.\nAnd they said the judge rejected that argument, so\nnow they tell us, well, that was wrong, he should have\naccepted it. And all the rest of what he's saying is\njust in case the Court wants to reach it, or something\nlike that. But what about that one?\nMS. PERRY: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Could you --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, should we answer\nthe question he now -- perhaps in his minimalist\nposition -- might want to raise, or maybe did, that\nSection 53 doesn't speak of causation, the judge gave a\ncausation instruction. The judge's causation instruction\nin their view was wrong, and the law requires the judge's\ncausation instruction on contributory negligence, if\nthere is one, to be the same as it was on direct, the\ndefendant's negligence. And he says that isn't what\nhappened, we objected to it, we produced arguments, one\nof them was this equivalence thing.\nSo he's saying to us: Decide it, say that they\nwere wrong. What's your view of that?\nMS. PERRY: We disagree with petitioner.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not surprised.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. PERRY: The abstract question of equivalency\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. That's just an argument.\nMS. PERRY: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It was not, but they say,\nnonetheless, we did object that this instruction was\nwrong. One reason it was wrong is because it speaks of\ncausation differently than when they spoke of causation\nin respect to the railroad. We thought that was a reason\nwhy it was wrong then. We think that's a reason why it\nis wrong now, and we would like the Missouri court, but\nthey wouldn't do it, so we want you to say it was wrong\nfor that reason.\nMS. PERRY: Well, I think we're in a difficult\nposition right now, because they're asking for proximate\ncause in their blue brief --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, we say, well, we'll abandon\nall that, that's just a series of different arguments\nthat we'd like the Court to say.\nMS. PERRY: Okay. If we're putting aside the blue\nbrief then --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you read it carefully, you'll\nsee it, basically.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. PERRY: But if the question goes to the fact\nthat Section 53 doesn't have an express causation\nstandard in it, what you fall back on is traditional\nproximate cause, that Congress departed from the\ntraditional proximate cause standard by using the words\n\"resulting in whole or in part\" in Section 51. It didn't\ncreate the same departure in Section 53.\nIn fact, by referring to the kind of contributory\nnegligence that creates a bar, it was pretty much\npointing right back to proximate cause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can you have more than one\nproximate cause?\nMS. PERRY: I believe the treatises that say yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course. So then how can \"in\nwhole or in part\" possibly eliminate the proximate cause\nrequirement, because it could be in part and still be a\nproximate cause. How can that language possibly be\ninterpreted to eliminate the proximate cause requirement?\nMS. PERRY: Because when a cause that -- when a\nslightest cause can give rise to liability, that has\neffectively reduced or relaxed that causation standard.\nThere is still a legal cause requirement, yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it could be the slightest\ndirect cause, which is Justice Scalia's point.\nMS. PERRY: Well, but if we look at like the first\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Now, it may mislead the jury if\nthat's all you say. But as a matter of analyzing the\nstatute or even of analyzing what the Court meant in\nRogers, you can have a slight but direct cause, and that\nwould be proximate cause in the traditional analysis;\nisn't that so?\nMS. PERRY: Well, no. The Restatement, for\nexample, at the time of Rogers talked about substantial\nfactors, and talked, in other words --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How can you say no when you\nacknowledge that the prior law when there was\ncontributory negligence used to require proximate cause\nfor both the negligence of the defendant and for the\ncontributory negligence of the defendant? Such a\nsituation could not exist unless proximate cause doesn't\nhave to be the sole cause. It can be just the cause in\npart, right?\nMS. PERRY: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the mere fact that we had\ncontributory negligence statutes that were applying\nproximate cause requirements demonstrates that a\nproximate cause can be a cause in part.\nMS. PERRY: Yes, Your Honor, but what Rogers and\nthe statute recognizes that it can be a very, very slight\ncause. And what it was understood, for example, in the\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what Rogers might\nhave said, but the statute doesn't say anything about\nslight cause. It only says in whole or in part.\nMS. PERRY: And neither did the instruction. It\njust used the words \"resulting in whole or in part\" also.\nBut Rogers did interpret the language \"resulting in whole\nor in part\" as meaning playing any part, even the\nslightest. And that has been the law for 50 years. And\nit would be a massive change in the law, as Justice\nScalia said earlier, for this Court to depart from that\nat this point in time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't seem to me that slight\nis the opposite of proximate. It could be a slight\nproximate cause.\nMS. PERRY: The Restatement at the time of Rogers\ntalked about substantial factors, and in the comment to\nthat, it explains that sometimes the other causes can be\nso predominant that one causation is just not\nsufficiently significant or of sufficient quantum to\nconstitute a legal cause.\nSo there is a component of quantity within the\nconcepts of proximate cause. I believe their reply brief\ntalks about substantial factor, and to talk about\nsomething as being a substantial factor does have a\nquantum component to it, just as slight has a quantum\ncomponent to it. A slight cause could not be a\nsubstantial factor, or oftentimes would not be a\nsubstantial factor. So the two really do go hand in\nglove.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But under the old rule that\nplaintiff's negligence in whatever degree was an absolute\nbar to recovery, wasn't the rule customarily stated that\nplaintiff's negligence, however slight, was a total bar\nto recovery?\nMS. PERRY: I'm not aware of that, Your Honor. It\nmay be.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I thought it was. I may be wrong\nabout that.\nMS. PERRY: I am not aware of that. So that would\nbe a pretty harsh remedy if that were the case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's what I thought. Yes, I\nthought it was a pretty harsh rule.\nMS. PERRY: And clearly, Congress in this statute\nwas trying to move away from the common law in many\nrespects to protect the railroad worker. And the\ninterpretation of Section 51 as lightening the causation\nstandard for the defendant's negligence, but leaving\nintact the traditional proximate cause standard for\nplaintiff's contributory negligence completely comports\nwith the purpose of Congress in enacting the statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't \"in whole or in\npart\" simply the logical corollary of introducing\ncomparative negligence? Why do you have to read that as\ndeparting from proximate cause, instead of simply\nrecognizing that under 53, negligence on the part of the\nemployee can reduce recovery which -- without barring it?\nMS. PERRY: I reach that conclusion on the basis\nof Rogers. And in the petitioner's brief --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Beyond that, if the plaintiff's\nnegligence was in whole the cause of the action, then the\n-- there was no reason to get to comparative negligence\nor contributory negligence, because by hypothesis, there\nwould have been no negligence by the defendant.\nMS. PERRY: Yes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's why you don't have\n\"in whole or in part\" in 53, not because they wanted to\ndepart from proximate cause there, but because, as\nJustice Stevens pointed out, you wouldn't have it in\nwhole or in part.\nMS. PERRY: Even the petitioner's brief describes\nthe language \"resulting in whole or in part\" as an\nelaboration of proximate cause. They recognize that it\nhas bearing on proximate cause. And so if it has bearing\non proximate cause in Section 51, it certainly would have\nbearing on proximate cause if it was incorporated into\nthe language of the instruction on contributory\nnegligence.\nSo that may be one reason for not including the\nlanguage, but another reason is that it does affect the\ncausation standard and Congress did not incorporate it in\nSection 53, whereas it did have it in Section 51. And\nwhen it modified the statute in 1939 for assumption of\nthe risk, to abolish assumption of the risk, it did not\nequate proximate cause and \"resulting in whole or in\npart\" necessarily as the same thing because one version\nhad proximate cause and it was not adopted. The phrase\n\"resulting in whole or in part\" was used in its place.\nSo suggesting that Congress may, in fact, have\nseen a difference, just as Rogers concluded, and I think\nrightly so.\nMoreover, as I said, that has been the law for 50\nyears, and it's pretty settled in this country and it\nwould create a massive change if this Court were to\ndepart from that. Moreover, this is not the right case\nto decide that because the language in instruction 12\nsaid, \"resulting in whole or in part.\" And petitioner\nhas never --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is not the kind of change\nanybody would have relied on, is it? I mean, I find it\nhard to see reliance interest on this interpretation.\nMS. PERRY: Excuse me, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I find it hard to see any\nreliance interest on this 50 year old interpretation.\nIs there anybody doing something differently because they\nbelieve that the railroad does not have to be accused of\nproximate causality? Does anybody act differently\nbecause of that rule? I don't think so.\nMS. PERRY: Well, for Mr. Sorrell in particular, I\nmean, he acted, that he allowed that instruction to be\nused, and now they're attempting to disrupt this\njudgment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I suppose employees have been\nunder the rule for a long time.\nMS. PERRY: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose employee associations,\nworkman compensation schemes and Congress have all relied\non it.\nMS. PERRY: Yes, you're absolutely right, Your\nHonor. And there is employees' compensation for railroad\nworkers, and that may be very well be because of this\ninterpretation of Rogers that was adopted 50 years ago.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Perry.\nMS. PERRY: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Phillips, you have two\nminutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd\nlike to address just sort of two issues. One is the\nminimalist issue that Justice Breyer asked about. It\nseems to me that the minimalist way to look at this case\nis we raised the question of whether or not the Missouri\nstandard which says that you cannot deviate from our\ndesignated instructions creates a disparity in the way\nyou approach negligence and contributory negligence, that\ndisparity is inconsistent with the common law doctrines,\nand nothing in FELA modifies it, and it's wrong. And\nthat by itself warrants the case being set aside and a\nnew jury being -- and a new trial. That's the simplest\nway to resolve the issue.\nIf the Court wishes to go forward and deal with\nthe issue that Justice Souter addressed, then the\nquestion is, what does Rogers mean and what do you do\nwith this \"in whole or in part\" language. And if you go\nback -- you asked the question, Justice Souter, you know,\nwhat does the common law say. We cite this on page 38.\nIf its negligence contributes proximately to the injury,\nno matter how slightly -- there must be a dozen cases\nthat we cite in those briefs that talk about no matter\nhow slightly. And they refer to \"in whole or in part\" as\nlanguage that still recognizes that you still require\nproximate causation.\nThe reality is nothing in Rogers remotely casts\ndoubt on cases like Brady that say but-for causation is\nnot enough, you have to have proximate causation, or\nEarnest, where this Court said that proximate causation\nis the correct jury instruction that has to be given.\nThis Court said nothing about that in Rogers.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you have in your ideal\ninstruction the words proximate cause given to the jury,\nthat defendant's negligence must be the proximate cause\nof plaintiff's injury?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, Justice Ginsburg. We didn't\nask for that. All I'm saying to you --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you?\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- is that the guidance of the\nCourt on remand, you could, and we would ask you to\naddress that issue and to resolve it. It is fairly in\nfront of you.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in your model instruction,\nin your correct instruction, would the jury be told, in\norder to hold the defendant liable, you must find the\ndefendant's negligence is the proximate cause of\nplaintiff's injury?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. That would be my preferred\ninstruction on remand, yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though almost universally,\nthe term proximate cause has been criticized as totally\nincomprehensible to juries?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this one very brief\nquestion, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIn your view, would the doctrine of equivalence be\nsatisfied if we simply directed that the word directly be\nomitted from the instruction 13?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think that would certainly go a\nlong way. I don't know exactly how strictly you want to\ndo it, but sure. I mean, that's the pivotal problem with\nthe way that instruction reads today, Justice Stevens.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Phillips.\n"
