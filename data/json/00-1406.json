        "content": "(10:07 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnow in No. 00-1406, Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Mario\nEchazabal.\nMr. Shapiro.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SHAPIRO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health,\nhepatitis C kills 8,000 to 10,000 people in this country\nevery year, and it's the largest cause of liver\ntransplants. This is a progressive disease, which in many\ncases goes without any symptoms for a period of time, but\nin a large percentage of cases, it results in cirrhosis\nand liver failure. The disease in this instance was\nchronic, active, and severe, according to the standards of\nthe NIH.\nNow, NIOSH's Occupational Health Guidelines also\nconfirm that the chemicals in this factory were liver\ntoxins. The ordinary worker can withstand that exposure,\nwhich is consistent with OSHA standards. But the\nGovernment's guidelines say again and again that employees\nshould receive medical tests before beginning work to look\nout for special vulnerability. NIOSH's statement about\nphenol, one of the 12 chemicals here, is typical, and I\nquote from the guideline. Liver damage may occur.\nPersons with a history of abnormalities of the liver would\nbe expected to be at increased risk from exposure.\nNow, none of this matters according to the Ninth\nCircuit because injury to self is beyond the employer's\nlegitimate concern. But we believe that the plain\nlanguage of the statute and its structure tell a\ncompletely different story.\nThe defense provision in the statute, which is\nsection 12113(a), first speaks in general terms.\nQUESTION: Where do we find that, Mr. Shapiro?\nMR. SHAPIRO: That is found on page 59a of the\npetition appendix.\nQUESTION: 59a?\nMR. SHAPIRO: 59a, Your Honor, yes.\nQUESTION: Actually it's 58a, 1211(a), at the\nbottom --\nMR. SHAPIRO: It begins on 58a, but the\npertinent provision, 12113(a), is right there on 59a.\nQUESTION: You first referred to the general\nrule. That's what I thought.\nMR. SHAPIRO: And the general provision says it\nis permissible to use qualification standards and tests\nthat are job-related and consistent with business\nnecessity. This is generic language and it does not\nexclude injury to self. After this general provision, the\nstatute --\nQUESTION: Which one is the general provision?\nMR. SHAPIRO: The -- the first part is 12113(a),\nwhich states: in general. That's the general defense\nprovision.\nAnd right after it comes a particular example in\nsubpart (b), which refers to risks to other individuals.\nAnd that, of course, is just an example that fits within\nthe general rule here, and we know it's just an example\nbecause Congress said that permissible standards may\ninclude such a test. This is obviously not an exhaustive\ndescription.\nQUESTION: And why isn't it an exhaustive\ndescription at least of that category, of the category of\ndirect threat to health or safety? I can see that the\nwords, may include, may include this and it may include\nthat, but when the -- when the Congress is describing\ndirect threat and it has only the health of other\nindividuals, why for that part isn't it self-contained? I\nmean, you say it has a plain meaning. It would have been\nmuch plainer if Congress had said: of the individual or\nothers, if that's what it meant.\nMR. SHAPIRO: We think the -- the phrase, may\ninclude, is illustrative of matters that might fit into\nthe general description that comes just before and that\ninjury to -- to other persons and injury to self are --\nare both matters that fit within the general description\nof business necessity, public safety --\nQUESTION: Well, there's some legislative\nhistory that suggests that indeed it wasn't intended to\nallow review of danger or risk to the employee himself.\nMR. SHAPIRO: We found several instances that we\ncite in our brief where Congress was talking about injury\nto -- to the individual himself. So, again, it's not an\nexclusive reference. And I think if you look at the\nstructure of the statute, Justice O'Connor, it again helps\nto answer this question.\nQUESTION: It's -- surely it's exclusive to some\nextent. I mean, Mr. Shapiro, you certainly wouldn't argue\nthat a qualification could include a requirement that the\n-- that the individual not pose an indirect threat to the\nhealth or safety of other individuals.\nMR. SHAPIRO: That might be an inference from\nthat language --\nQUESTION: Right. So --\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- that that would be inconsistent\nwith the express language.\nQUESTION: Right. So, I guess the question is\nhow strong is the exclusionary inference --\nMR. SHAPIRO: We think it's -- it's particularly\nweak because the -- the provision that comes right before\nthis provision that deals with discrimination makes it\nclear that the employer may use medical examinations and\nmay make an offer of employment contingent on the results\nof those medical examinations. That's in the\ndiscrimination section.\nQUESTION: Where -- where is that now? What are\nyou --\nMR. SHAPIRO: That is in section 12112(d), which\nis quoted in our reply brief at page 7.\nQUESTION: Where do we find that? Reply brief?\nMR. SHAPIRO: At reply brief page 7. It says\nthe employer may require a medical examination and may\ncondition an offer of employment on the results of that\nexamination. Again, the focus is perfectly general in\nscope. The exam is lawful if it is job-related and\nconsistent with business need.\nNow, we don't think it's necessary to resort to\nlegislative history in this case, but there is a\nconference report here that stated that this act does not\nintend to override any -- any -- legitimate medical\nstandards or requirements established by employers for\nsafety-sensitive positions.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Shapiro, as I go through\nthis statute, under your theory of the case, beginning on\npage 58a, 12118, do you concede, for purposes of the\nstatutory analysis, that the employee here was a qualified\nindividual?\nMR. SHAPIRO: We -- we deny that he was a\nqualified individual. We make two arguments: one, that\n-- that we have a business necessity not to hire somebody\nwho would be killed in this particular job, but also that\nhe's not qualified.\nQUESTION: So, as -- as you see the case, could\nwe dispose of the case by reading just 1211 -- 121118 and\nend it right there --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: -- and find what we're talking about\nin defenses just does not bear on our determination one\nway or the other? Obviously, you look at the whole\ncontext of the statute to make sure that what you're doing\nis consistent -- consistent with it.\nMR. SHAPIRO: I -- I would agree with that, and\nwe --\nQUESTION: It's hard to say he's not qualified\nwhen he worked there for the other contractor in the same\ncircumstances for 20 years or so.\nMR. SHAPIRO: The qualification standard focuses\non whether he can perform the job on an ongoing basis in\nthe near term. And -- and if the person would become\nseriously ill or die in the near term, that person can't\ncarry out the job functions.\nQUESTION: But 12113 specifically deals with\nqualification standards. I mean, don't you think that the\nqualification standards portion has to be read in pari\nmateria with the -- with the -- with the provision\ndefining a qualified individual? I mean, it seems to me\nthe two are addressing exactly the same thing.\nMR. SHAPIRO: There is linguistic overlap and\nthere is practical overlap. A person who is not qualified\nis a person --\nQUESTION: I mean, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't\nsay that -- that a person is not a qualified individual if\nhe would pose an indirect threat to the health or safety\nof others, would you? Because that's clearly excluded.\nYou cannot use that as a qualification standard. I -- I\njust don't think it's an easy way out. I just -- it is in\nanother section, but I think that other section has to be\nread to -- to be corresponding to the qualification\nstandards.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Our view is that there's overlap\nbetween qualification and business necessity.\nQUESTION: Are we ultimately --\nMR. SHAPIRO: But they're not coextensive.\nQUESTION: Are we ultimately asking the\nquestion, is he qualified?\nMR. SHAPIRO: That's the first question. The\nsecond question is, if he is qualified, because, as\nJustice O'Connor said, he can do the job in the short run,\nwhich we don't think he can, then the question is whether\nwe have a business need to retain him.\nQUESTION: Well, but let me -- when we go\nthrough the whole statute, including 121113, do you\nultimately say we come to the conclusion that after\nreading the whole statute, he is not qualified, as that\nterm is used in 8?\nMR. SHAPIRO: That's our principal submission.\nOur backup --\nQUESTION: Now, you don't even rely on the EEOC\nregulation? At least you're not arguing from that.\nMR. SHAPIRO: We -- we -- it's one of our -- we\nhave several arguments in the alternative, yes.\nQUESTION: The regulation specifically says the\nindividual -- the threat to the individual can be\nconsidered.\nMR. SHAPIRO: We believe we -- we can win the\ncase on that ground.\nQUESTION: But the Ninth Circuit thought that\nwent beyond the clear terms of the statute.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes, and we think that that\nregulation is perfectly consistent with -- with the\ngeneral defense provision, and we believe we can win the\ncase under that regulation and, indeed, that it's entitled\nto Chevron deference because this agency had legislative\nrulemaking power to issue that standard.\nQUESTION: But then you give the -- then you\ngive the agency no deference at all when the agency says,\nyes, of course, he's a qualified individual. He can do\nthe job. He's done it and he hasn't dropped dead for\nthose 20 years. But so you say don't give the EEOC any\nrespect on -- on the qualified individual, but give them\nChevron deference on the 12113.\nMR. SHAPIRO: We --\nQUESTION: So, it's kind of when you like what\nthe agency says, you respect it, and when you don't like\nit, you don't respect it.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, I would note that the -- the\nagency in its cert stage amicus brief said that the\nqualification issue is whether the individual can perform\nthe job in the near term. And we agree with that. But we\nsay this person cannot do that because --\nQUESTION: Well, if you agree with what they\nsaid -- they have spelled it out what their position is in\ntheir brief, and they said, in no uncertain terms, this is\na qualified individual.\nMR. SHAPIRO: But you'll -- you'll note --\nQUESTION: That's just in the brief, though.\nThey didn't issue a rule to that effect, did they?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Absolutely. That's just a\nbrief --\nQUESTION: And we're -- we're not paying any\nattention to what they say in briefs, are we?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, they say -- they say helpful\nthings in the brief too. They note that firemen and --\nand airline pilots and others that would succumb to an\nillness while they're conducting their jobs in the near\nterm are disqualified. They're not qualified to do the\njob. And the reason is that safety considerations are\nparamount there, they say.\nWell, they're paramount in this refinery too.\nThere were five physicians here who said this individual\nwas at imminent risk of death --\nQUESTION: Just out of curiosity, why does he\nwant to kill himself?\nMR. SHAPIRO: It's an old story, Your Honor.\nSome people do not listen to their doctors. I won't\nspeculate on --\nQUESTION: All right. You say -- I mean -- the\nreason I ask that question is I suspect in any real case,\nsince people don't really want to kill themselves, there's\nan argument about how risky it is.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, if you read the cases that\nwe've cited, it's amazing how frequently people with --\nQUESTION: In all those other cases, it seemed\nto me -- in all the cases that you cited --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- there was a different issue at\nstake, and that in part was whether he could do the job.\nAnd here, perhaps unrealistically we are assuming, for the\nsake of this case, that he can do the job perfectly well.\nMR. SHAPIRO: We -- we don't assume that.\nQUESTION: All right. You don't. But suppose\n-- I don't know. I thought the issue is presented in the\ncontext where we're forced to make that assumption. I\ndon't think anyone denies that if he can't do the job with\nreasonable accommodation, you have the right not to hire\nhim. I don't know that anyone denies that one.\nMR. SHAPIRO: We say he -- he is like the steel\nworker with vertigo who can fall --\nQUESTION: Fine.\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- off the beam at any moment --\nQUESTION: Fine. If that's correct -- does\nanyone doubt that proposition of law?\nMR. SHAPIRO: I hope not.\nQUESTION: No, all right. So, this becomes\nserious as a matter of law only if we assume that he can\ndo the job. And I just wonder under those circumstances\nwhether in any real case the issue isn't an argument about\nhow risky it is, and if that's so, my question would be,\nwhy doesn't this statute try to leave that matter up to\nhim? If he does the job for you okay, that's your\nbusiness. And if he wants to run greater risks than you\nthink he should, that's his business.\nMR. SHAPIRO: This statute rejects that thesis\nin the medical examination provisions, recognizing that\nthe employer has a stake in this issue. There are many\nlegitimate interests that the employer has.\nQUESTION: Is it the case that it would violate\nthe Occupational Safety and Health Act for Chevron to hire\nthis person under those circumstances? Do we know that?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Arguably it would, Your Honor,\nbecause this is a known hazard.\nQUESTION: Does that have to be considered then\nin the balance of qualification? And the court below, I\nguess, didn't resolve that.\nMR. SHAPIRO: It should -- it should factor into\nthe business necessity evaluation because we do have a\nbusiness necessity to avoid violating State law and\nFederal law. And here there --\nQUESTION: What section of the OSHA would you\npoint to on that?\nMR. SHAPIRO: I would point to the general\nduty --\nQUESTION: And is it -- is it in the material\nbefore us?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, I -- I see we -- we didn't put\nit in our appendix, but it's the general duty provision of\nthe OSHA statute cited in our opening brief and our reply\nbrief. And what it says is that if you've recognized a\nhazard, you cannot send the employee into the jaws of that\nhazard.\nQUESTION: Where -- where is the text of that\nthat you're reading now?\nMR. SHAPIRO: It's the general duty clause --\nQUESTION: Maybe you can supply it later rather\nthan take your time now --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes. We'll supply it for you.\nQUESTION: -- because we would be interested.\nQUESTION: You were -- you were about to say why\nthe -- the employer has an interest other than the mere\ncharitable one in not letting an employee kill himself.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nQUESTION: What -- what is -- what are the\ninterests?\nMR. SHAPIRO: There are several --\nQUESTION: Other than not violating OSHA.\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- several interests. There --\nthere is Federal law compliance. There is State law\ncompliance. There is State tort law liability that we're\nconcerned about.\nQUESTION: Does Workman's Comp go up if -- if he\nsuffers?\nMR. SHAPIRO: It -- it could. It certainly\ncould.\nQUESTION: Suppose the Federal statute said this\nis -- this preempts any inconsistent duty, that the\nemployer is not liable for compliance with this statute.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, we would hope that\npreemption would work that way, but preemption issues in\nthe States court often do not.\nQUESTION: Let's assume -- let's assume it does.\nIs there still a business necessity?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes, there still is.\nQUESTION: And what is that?\nMR. SHAPIRO: That's -- that's preservation of\nemployment relations, avoidance of adverse publicity, and\n-- and fear of criminal responsibility. There have been\nmany criminal prosecutions, and courts never -- never hold\nthat -- that general criminal laws are -- are preempted by\nFederal safety legislation. So, I don't think that's --\nthat's any defense in that situation.\nThere are -- in all well-run businesses today,\nthe model of the business is safety is our business. For\n100 years in this country, the industrial policy has been\nsafety comes first. So, this is per se a legitimate\nbusiness interest in this context.\nNow, our -- our friend's argument to the\ncontrary, interestingly, is an exact replay of the\nargument that was made to the EEOC back in 1991 when the\nagency adopted its rules. The argument was made then that\nif you refer to risk to self, it's going to encourage\npaternalism and encourage negative stereotypes. But the\nagency rejected that argument, explaining it was\ninconsistent with the purpose of the statute and was\ninconsistent with a long line of cases under the\nRehabilitation Act. And the agency's judgment here, we\nbelieve, is entitled to Chevron deference.\nQUESTION: Wasn't that the argument that was\nmade in Johnson's Control that this is unsafe the -- the\n-- allowing a woman of child-bearing capacity to work --\nwas it -- what was the toxic substance --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- that -- that the same kind of\nevidence that you have about how dangerous it was, it's as\ndangerous to the woman, dangerous to the fetus?\nMR. SHAPIRO: That was evaluated under a\ndifferent legal standard, the BOFQ standard, which is much\nmore stringent. This Court has said the business\nnecessity standard is more flexible and -- and permissive.\nAnd that was a case where the Government said there was no\nserious risk, and all you had to do is take a simple\nprecaution and the lead would not injure the -- the\nfetuses of -- of the woman. And there was discrimination\nbetween the sexes, which was the real thrust of the\nCourt's decision, and there's nothing like that here.\nQUESTION: But I thought the BFOQ goes together\nwith an explicit sex --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- what do they call it? Disparate\ntreatment.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Exactly.\nQUESTION: And that here -- and the business\nnecessity goes with neutral rule disparate effect. Are\nyou saying that's what we have here?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Business necessity applies to any\nscreening test or medical examination or qualification\nstandard that the employer uses. And this was something\nthat the business community fought hard for in Congress to\nget this flexible test. It's repeated three or four times\nin -- in title I of the statute, and -- and to disregard\nit here we think defeats the very basis of this\nlegislation.\nI see I've used a great deal of my time. I\nwonder if I might reserve the balance of the time for\nrebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Shapiro.\nMs. Blatt, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIf I could first address just how the statute\nworks with respect to whether an individual is qualified.\nIt proceeds in two basic steps. The plaintiff has the\nburden of proof to show that he can perform the essential\nfundamental job tasks of the job and that he satisfies the\nemployer's other qualification standards.\nNow, if a particular qualification standard\nscreens out someone because he is disabled, then the\nburden shifts to the employer to justify that standard as\njob-related and consistent with business necessity. And\nwhat -- the EEOC's regulatory threat to self regulation is\none example of a subset of a valid standard that is job-\nrelated and consistent with business necessity.\nThe statute recognizes that a valid\nqualification standard may include a safety requirement\nthat an individual not pose a safety threat to others in\nthe work place. The EEOC has reasonably concluded that a\nparallel defense is available if the individual would pose\na significant safety threat to himself.\nQUESTION: I -- I have one question. I guess\nit's a -- maybe a soft variety of the expressio/exclusio\nargument. But the theory of Chevron deference is that the\n-- that the Congress basically left a blank place to be\nfilled in in whatever way the agency think is best. Why\nwould Congress have wanted to leave, as it were, a hiatus\non the question of individual safety when it specifically\nattended to safety of others? It just seems like an odd\nthing to leave up to the agency when it was that close to\nthe subject in -- in what it did require.\nMS. BLATT: Well, the context is very important\nhere. What the direct threat to others -- the statutory\nthreat to others defense -- is is a codification of this\nCourt's decision in Arline, and that arose in the context\nof a teacher with a contagious disease that posed a direct\nthreat to others. But Congress expressly anticipated that\nother types of safety threats would be addressed by the\nmore general business necessity. Congress simply didn't\naddress safety threats to self or safety threats to others\nin the public and not necessarily the work place.\nQUESTION: Perhaps Congress thought like Justice\nBreyer, that it's quite implausible that anybody would\nwant to kill himself. Right? I mean, it -- it is not\nsomething that leaps to mind, that you -- you have to stop\nsomebody from taking a job that's going to kill him,\nwhereas stop somebody from taking a job in which he's\ngoing to hurt somebody else, that's something you would\nworry about.\nMS. BLATT: The threat to self context can come\nup where an employee wants to either, A, assume the risk\nor, B, there's a disagreement about whether that risk in\nfact exists.\nNow, the question is, is when an employer can\nprove, meet a burden of showing a documented and\nscientific basis for finding a significant risk of\nsubstantial harm, the employer has legitimate interests in\nrefraining from injuring or killing its workers. The mere\nfact that the employee consents to that risk cannot trump\nthe employer's interests, no more than it could if the\nemployees agreed to assume the risk of working in an\nenvironment with a person with tuberculosis. In both\ncases, the employer has legitimate interests.\nNow, at the same time, the legislative history\nshows that Congress was concerned about employment\ndecisions based on stereotype or group-based predictions\nand unfounded fears about disabled people posing safety\nthreats. And what the regulations do is carefully balance\nthe employer's legitimate interest with the rights of\ndisabled persons to be free of these prejudicial decisions\nby requiring an individualized determination that looks at\nthe person's actual medical condition and recognizes that\ndisabilities pose varying levels of side effects and\nlimitations or safety threats and requires an objective\ndetermination based on --\nQUESTION: Well, they have a physician's exam\nand report. Is that enough?\nMS. BLATT: The regulations require it to be\nbased on objective or other medical examination.\nQUESTION: Well, so this --\nMS. BLATT: And that may -- well may be.\nQUESTION: So, is that enough in -- in the view\nof the Government?\nMS. BLATT: In the view of the Government, if\nthe medical opinion is reasonable, then that's enough.\nNow, in -- in this case --\nQUESTION: But you take the position in the\nbrief that perhaps it isn't. I was curious about that.\nMS. BLATT: The position that the EEOC argued to\nthe Ninth Circuit, which the Ninth Circuit did not address\nand would be available on remand, was that there was a\nfactual dispute that summary judgment should not be\nentered on whether there was a reasonable determination.\nBut employers are entitled to rely on the reasonable\nmedical judgments that reflect available current --\ncurrent medical knowledge.\nQUESTION: Can I ask you a question about the\nreg? Because normally you should, of course, defer to the\nagency's regs. I understand that. But this particular\nreg is surprising the way it's written; that is, it\ndoesn't say there are a lot of qualification standards.\nOne of them is a direct threat to individuals, contagious\ndisease problem. Another one is the suicidal employee.\nRather it has the definition of the word, direct threat,\nand that's where it sticks the word self. And it appears\nthen to be talking about a definition in the statute,\ndirect threat to others. And it defines direct threat to\nothers as direct threat to self and others. Now, if what\nit's doing is explaining the words, direct threat to\nothers, I don't see how you can define the words, direct\nthreat to others, to deal with a completely different kind\nof problem involving direct threat to self.\nMS. BLATT: With all due respect, Justice\nBreyer, what the -- what the agency did -- and it's on\npage 60a of the petition -- is said that a valid\nqualification standard includes a requirement that there\nnot be a direct threat to the individual. And then it\nseparately defined direct threat in terms of the way\ndirect threat was defined by Congress.\nQUESTION: And you left out three things. It\nsays, direct threat to the health and safety of the\nindividual or others. See 1630.2(r) defining direct\nthreat, which refers you back to the reg in which what\nthey seem to be doing is defining the words, direct\nthreat.\nMS. BLATT: But what -- what the agency did, as\na matter of administrative convenience in protecting the\nrights of disabled persons, is that in -- in crafting a\nregulatory threat to self defense, it wanted to ensure\nthat the same protections would be given to workers and\nthat there had to be a showing of a significant risk of\nsubstantial harm. At the same time, this was beneficial\nto employers. So they wouldn't be confused by two\ndifferent standards, it would be the same standard.\nThe agency could have accomplished the same\nresult had it said, well, we want this direct threat to\nothers that follows the statute and as far as threats to\nself were concerned, it could have just avoided using the\nword, direct threat, and said, don't adopt a qualification\nstandard unless it screens out significant safety risks\nthat cause substantial harm. So, the mere fact -- it was\nadministrative convenience to -- to have a parallel\ndefense and using the terminology of direct threat.\nQUESTION: May I ask you, Ms. Blatt? Do you\nthink -- does the Government think that it was proper for\nthe district court to enter summary judgment in the case?\nMS. BLATT: Yes, on the -- the EEOC argued that\nthe summary judgment on -- on direct threat with respect\nto petitioner's argument. And that would be available for\nthe Ninth Circuit to consider on remand if this Court\nupheld the -- the regulation.\nQUESTION: Is the district court saying that\nthose two other doctors don't count because they weren't\nbefore -- I thought you had just said, in response to an\nearlier question, that that would be open if the -- on\nremand, the question of whether this person was in fact a\nrisk to himself because, as I understand it, there were\ntwo witnesses that said he -- he was not.\nMS. BLATT: Petitioner is arguing that its\nmedical -- physicians advised that there was -- that there\nwas a direct threat here. And what respondent argued in\nresponse to that on summary judgment is that those\ndecisions weren't reasonable. And we just think the\nparties have a genuine fact dispute about --\nQUESTION: But the district judge said they\ndidn't. The district judge said, I reject those two\nwitnesses. They come too late. Goodbye. Summary\njudgment. So --\nMS. BLATT: It's -- but what's relevant is not\nthat the opinions were submitted late, it's whether at the\ntime -- the -- the relevant inquiries at the time the\nemployment decision is made, but you can still ignore what\nthe medical literature says and make an unreasonable\ndecision.\nQUESTION: So, you think -- you're saying the\ndistrict court erred as to that extent in saying summary\njudgment, no trial. This person is a danger to himself.\nMS. BLATT: The United States hasn't\nindependently briefed it, but that is what the EEOC argued\nto the Ninth Circuit. And it does turn on complicated\nmedical questions that would be appropriately addressed by\nthe Ninth Circuit on remand. What -- what we think this\nCourt should do is hold that respondent was a qualified\nindividual, but the employer is entitled to show that he's\nnot qualified because it has a valid qualification\nstandard that --\nQUESTION: But do you have a position on the\nquestion whether, as a matter of law, the defendant has\nsustained the burden of proof that it was a reasonable\nmedical decision?\nMS. BLATT: The EEOC argued below no.\nQUESTION: I'm not asking what the EEO argued\nbelow. I'm asking what is the Government's position on\nthat issue.\nMS. BLATT: I don't know what the United States'\nposition on that is, but we don't have any reason to\ndisagree with the EEOC. We just haven't independently\nlooked at it. But the EEOC certainly makes a reasonable\nargument that there was a factual dispute on it and\nsummary judgment was inappropriate.\nQUESTION: Was inappropriate.\nMS. BLATT: Inappropriate, right, that there was\na genuine fact dispute about whether the direct threat\ntest was met here, and we think the Ninth Circuit should\nbe able to -- to address that in the first instance.\nQUESTION: Address whether -- whether that\nargument is true or not.\nMS. BLATT: Right, that because there is a valid\nregulation that the EEOC promulgated and it's entitled to\ndeference, it should be upheld, and there's just a\nquestion about whether it was met in this particular case.\nQUESTION: Ms. Blatt, I -- I find it peculiar to\nsay he was a qualified individual but he didn't meet the\nemployer's qualification standards. I mean, what is a\nqualified individual except one who can do what the\nemployer's standard says has to be done?\nMS. BLATT: May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. BLATT: It's just -- if I could give you the\nexample of the airline pilot with a contagious disease.\nHe's qualified to fly the plane, but he may, nonetheless,\npose an unacceptable safety risk, and that's a valid\nqualification standard to -- to not hire him. It's just a\nquestion of burden of proof basically, Justice --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Blatt.\nMr. Bagenstos, we'll hear from you. Am I\npronouncing your name correctly?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL R. BAGENSTOS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Yes, Your Honor.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe exclusion of individuals with disabilities\nfrom jobs for their own protection was a principal target\nof the Americans with Disabilities Act, but the threat to\nself defense proposed by Chevron here would provide\naffirmative legal authorization for precisely that sort of\nconduct.\nFor three principal reasons, we think it clear\nthat Congress did not authorize such a threat to self\ndefense, the first simply being the statutory text and\nparticularly the change from the EEOC's prior regulations\nunder the Rehabilitation Act which specifically included a\nthreat to self disqualification to the ADA's direct threat\nprovision which is limited to threats to others.\nThe second being the consistent jurisprudence\nunder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a statute\nthat provided a significant model for Title I of the ADA,\nthat also responds in significant measure to a problem of\npaternalistic discrimination and --\nQUESTION: Just tell us, if you would, why the\nemployee would want to take a job where the doctor says\nit's going to kill you?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I -- I think that --\nQUESTION: These toxins will cause your early\ndeath. Now, why does the employee want that job?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I think there aren't\nreally employees who want to do that.\nI think Justice Breyer and Justice Scalia's\npoints made in the first half of the argument are well\ntaken. When Congress was looking at this issue, it wasn't\nthinking about the largely fanciful case where the\nemployee -- where the employee wants to -- wants to go\ninto a suicidal situation, but was thinking about the run\nof cases where, you know, there -- there's a small risk,\nthere's an overstatement of the risk, there's some dispute\nabout the risk. The -- and then the question is who\ndecides.\nQUESTION: And what is it here?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: And -- and here I think it's\nclear there's a dispute about the nature of the risk. I\nthink it's also clear if you look to what -- even the --\neven the testimony of Chevron's doctors is here. It's a\nsmall risk. Right? So -- so, when the -- when the\ndoctors are asked what is the probability that this is\ngoing to happen, they can't put a number on it. Dr. Tang\nclosest he -- who is the -- who is the most credentialed\ndoctor for Chevron's side of the case, the closest he can\ncome is he says, well, something like 1 percent. This is\nat page 88 of the joint appendix. So, what we're really\nsaying here is that, you know, people get injured in this\nwork place from time to time. Maybe there's a 1 percent\nincremental risk. Even if you accept Chevron's\nargument --\nQUESTION: May I interrupt you just for a\nmoment? Perhaps you're right on the facts of this case,\nbut the legal rule that you're contending for seems it\nwould apply even if the risk was 99 percent and 2 weeks\nfrom today.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: I think that -- I think that is\ncorrect, Your Honor. And -- and my response to Justice\nO'Connor was I think it's appropriate in crafting a rule\nfor Congress to think that the 99 percent death 2 weeks\nfrom today cases aren't really going to arise, that the\nrun of cases are going to be like this.\nQUESTION: How sure can you be about that?\nThere are people who smoke when they know the risk is very\nclear. There are people who will take serious risks\nbecause they need to earn money to support a family, and\nthey often will do things their doctors tell them not to\ndo. But you say they have an absolute right to take\nwhatever the risk is.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I -- I think they have --\nthey have the same right as people who don't have\ndisabilities. A very important point is that the question\nis -- the question here is -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nWould you like to --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I want to also get your\nview on that because there's another aspect of the case\nthat I'm puzzled by. Mr. Shapiro at the beginning said\nthat everybody else in the plant is safe under the OSHA\nstandards and so that only this person is at risk. Is --\ndo you agree with that, or is there also risk to everybody\nelse in the plant?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I -- I think that the\ntestimony of -- of the two experts on our side of the case\n-- this is why I say it's disputed. The testimony of the\ntwo experts on our side of the case is to the effect that\nif there is a risk for Mr. Echazabal, there is a risk for\neveryone else in the plant.\nBut the real issue is not whether the employer\ncan take steps to make its work place safe. The real\nissue is whether the employer or the employee gets to make\nthe decision whether --\nQUESTION: Is it conceivable that someone would\nnot be disabled but still be in a position where the -- he\nwould propose a risk to himself similar to this?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: I -- I -- of course, it's\npossible. That's absolutely right. And we don't have\nany --\nQUESTION: Surely the employer can say no in\nthat situation.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I think -- I think what\nthe employer can do -- the employer can certainly do\nwhatever it wants with respect to people who don't have\ndisabilities as defined in the statute, at least as far as\nthe ADA is concerned.\nBut again, the -- the question here is we have\nan individual who is excluded precisely because the\nemployer believed that his disability rendered him unsafe.\nAnd the question is who gets to decide whether this job is\ntoo unsafe. Is it the employer? Is it the employee? We\nbelieve that -- that Congress firmly left that decision in\nthe hands of the employee.\nQUESTION: But the reason you make -- I think\nthe reason you make that argument is essentially the --\nthe paternalism theory. Congress rejected paternalism.\nBut isn't what Congress rejected a combination of\npaternalism and stereotype? It rejected the kind of\nJohnson Controls situation which would say all women are\nat risk. Here you can call it paternalism if you want to,\nbut at least the -- the medical claim is that there is a\ndetermination of risk specific to this individual. And\ncan we say that Congress rejected the employer's authority\nto take that into consideration? No stereotype.\nSpecific.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: I think -- I think we can say\nthat. I think we can -- we can say that because of the\nreference to over-protective rules and the statutory\nfindings. We can say that because of Congress' lopping\noff of the threat to self disqualification that had\npreviously appeared in the EEOC regs.\nQUESTION: Well, as I understand -- I want to\ncome back to that, but go ahead. I don't want to --\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I -- I was done with that\npoint.\nQUESTION: I was just going to say with respect\nto -- when you get to the regulation itself, one answer\nfrom the Government was that the -- the reason the\nregulation mentioned threats to others is that there was\n-- there was case law on the point, and there's -- there\nreally isn't comparable case law on threats to\nindividuals. So that one way to read what Congress did\nwas to say it wanted to preserve the law -- the case law\nthat there was and leave the rest open. What do you --\nwhat do you say to that argument?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I think -- I think that --\nthat I may misconstrue their argument, but -- but\ncertainly -- certainly as to the state of the\nRehabilitation Act law at the time the ADA was adopted,\nthere was a specific regulation by the EEOC. It's quoted\nin the petition's -- petition appendix at page 61, right,\nthat specifically said a person is qualified only if he\ncan perform the essential functions of the position in\nquestion without endangering the health or -- and safety\nof the individual and others.\nCongress in 42 U.S.C. 12201(a) adopted by\nreference the Rehabilitation Act regulations, at least as\na floor for protection under the ADA. This is one\ninstance where Congress actually departed from what the\nprior Rehabilitation Act regulations did. We think that\n-- that has particular significance, particularly in light\nof the consistent drum beat not just in the statutory\nfindings, not just in the legislative history at the\nhearing stage, at the committee report stage, at the floor\nstage, but also consistently in Title VII law, this --\nthis distinction between -- between excluding people based\non risk they pose to others and excluding people based on\nrisk they pose to themselves.\nQUESTION: Well, isn't there some room, though,\nfor the argument that it -- there may be a business\nnecessity not to hire somebody who's going to be killed as\na result? You do have OSHA standards. You do have\nworkmen's comp premiums that get jacked up if some\nemployee is injured on the job or made ill because of the\njob. You have probably labor relations problems as a\nresult of having somebody put at risk on the job. There\n-- there are arguments there for a business necessity\ndefense.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I think -- I think there\nmay be arguments there. I think that they -- I think that\nthey're misplaced as a justification across the board for\na threat to self defense as the EEOC has adopted.\nWorker's compensation premiums --\nQUESTION: Maybe but notwithstanding the\nregulation, just looking at the provisions of the act as\napplied in this case, how do we deal with that business\nnecessity argument?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I think I'd say two things\nabout that. First, I think that -- I think that the\ndecision that Congress made in 12113(b), the direct threat\nprovision, to say specifically this is -- this is a\ndefense that is limited to significant risks, because\nthat's how it defines direct threat, and risks to others,\nI think that -- that in and of itself suggests that\nCongress has foreclosed a business necessity defense for\nanything -- anything relating to safety risk that falls\noutside the terms of it, just as Congress couldn't -- just\nas an employer could not say, as Justice Scalia suggested,\nwell, we're excluding this person because of an indirect\nthreat, but there's a business necessity for it.\nQUESTION: Well, I thought Justice O'Connor's\nquestion was somewhat broader. Obviously, we understand\nyour statutory position. But the -- the point of her\nquestion at least, as -- as I began to consider it, was\nwhether or not in this society, it's -- it's wrong to say\nthat an employer should care about its employees.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Certainly --\nQUESTION: It seems to me that that's a very,\nvery important policy to further, and your position wants\nan employer to take a position that could be completely\nbarbarous. You have an employee who has severe mobility\nproblems near dangerous machines where he could be maimed,\nand you say that that's just irrelevant. I think that's a\n-- an argument that's very demeaning to a society that\nwants to encourage good conduct on -- on the part of its\nemployers.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I think that this Court\nconfronted basically the same argument in the Johnson\nControls case, that the employer said -- the employer\nsaid, look, we have a moral interest in the safety of our\nemployees.\nQUESTION: But wasn't that a case involving a\nbroad category of all women of child-bearing age whether\nor not you were dealing with a specific individual who had\nbeen told by the doctor you better not do this. That was\na broad categorical rule. Here we're dealing with an\nindividual and individual circumstances. Does that make a\ndifference, do you think? I mean, I would think Johnson\nis a -- a very sound concept as applied to broad\ncategories, but I'm not sure it covers this case.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I -- I mean, two points\nwith respect to that. One is I think that it's clear that\nas -- as the employment discrimination law moves from\nTitle VII which deals with large groups to -- to\ndisability, which as -- as this Court's definition of\ndisability decisions indicate, is a very individualized\nkind of a concept. Right? I mean, two people who have\nthe same medical diagnosis, one may have a disability, one\nmay not, this Court has repeatedly emphasized.\nNecessarily the kind of intentional discrimination we're\ntalking about is going to be intentional discrimination\nagainst a person because of his particular disability as\nopposed to because of some broader group membership.\nI -- I would suggest that there -- there is\nexclusion on the basis of some kind of group membership\neven in a case like this. Anyone with chronic hepatitis C\nwould be excluded by -- by what Chevron --\nQUESTION: But once -- once you eliminate the\nstereotyping as, you know, Justice Souter was -- was\ninquiring about, I don't see why Congress would be so\nadamant about paternalism for the handicapped but not\nadamant about paternalism for everybody else. I mean, if\n-- if I don't have a handicap, I have some disability that\n-- that does not qualify as a handicap, and I want to -- I\nwant to work in -- in a particular job, and it's\ndangerous, and under OSHA rules I don't have any right to\nsay, paternalistic State, get out of here. I'm willing to\naccept the risk. You can't do it. Why -- why is Congress\nonly worried about paternalism for the handicapped?\nOnce you eliminate the stereotyping, you have\nindividual determination that this person is -- is going\nto be harmed. Why does Congress say, if it's a disabled\nperson, he can kill himself, but if it's not a disabled\nperson, oh, no, you can let him kill yourself? Why would\nCongress want to make that distinction?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I think two -- two\npoints. One is if it's a disabled person, he still has to\nbe subject to the same OSHA rules as everyone else.\nBut two, why is Congress concerned about\npaternalistic discrimination? I mean, I -- I think a\nsignificant part of it is the concern that over the run of\ncases, there's -- when an employer looks at an individual\nwith a disability and the risk posed by that individual to\nhimself, history has shown -- and there's ample evidence\nof this in the -- in the legislative record -- history has\nshown that -- that there is likely to be an over-emphasis,\nan over-determination that there is in fact a risk.\nThe --\nQUESTION: By doctors? I mean, this requires\nmedical -- medical evidence.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: By doctor -- by doctors, company\ndoctors, as occurs -- as occurred --\nQUESTION: You're against even the most extreme\ncase, which this may not be. I mean, that's hard to see\nthat.\nI -- I -- but I'm particularly curious. What\nabout the reg? What about the reg? I mean, there it is.\nI take it your clients in this instance don't like the\nreg, but more often than not, the EEOC regs are quite\nfavorable to disabled people. So -- so, how can we say,\nwell in this case we're paying no attention to the reg,\nbut in some other case you'll be back here arguing we\nought to pay a lot of attention to the reg. So, what's\nyour response to that?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I don't think it's a\nquestion of -- of whose ox is gored. Right? I mean, I\nthink why this reg --\nQUESTION: Well, explain why it isn't.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Right. And why this reg doesn't\n-- ought not to get deference, it seems to me, is because\nwhat the EEOC is basically doing is sneaking back into its\nregulation a piece of the Rehabilitation Act regulation\nthat was cut out by Congress.\nQUESTION: You tell me how I write this sentence\nin the paragraph that says the reg doesn't matter? I say,\noh, they were sneaking this one in? I don't think I can\nwrite that.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: What is it I'm supposed to say about\nthat?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I -- I think that\ndeference doesn't apply when Congress has explicitly --\nQUESTION: If it's clear, that's right, but I\nfind it pretty hard to say it's clear when you start\ntalking about extreme cases. I mean, maybe this isn't one\nof them, but you have the carpenter who's -- you know. I\nmean, you know, we can make them up. I think they're very\nhypothetical. I doubt very much they really exist, but\nyou're asking for a rule that encompasses those\nhypothetical, far-out cases, and there I see the reg.\nWhat am I supposed to do?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: So, two -- two points about the\nextreme cases, I mean, if that's what we're focusing on.\nThe first point, as -- as Your Honor acknowledges, far-\nout probably don't exist. When Congress writes a rule, it\ndoesn't write a rule for the extreme cases. It writes a\nrule for the run of cases. So, it wouldn't be crazy to --\nto read Congress -- what Congress said as not --\nQUESTION: No. I find it difficult because I\nthink the subject matter of the potentially suicidal\nworker has nothing whatsoever to do with the problem of\ncontagious diseases. And so, I find it very hard to say\nthat in writing about contagious diseases, they were\nsaying anything whatsoever about suicides.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I think that -- I think\nthat one of the -- one of the changes that the ADA makes\nin the direct threat provision is broadening that from\ncontagious diseases to all other kinds of risks, number\none.\nQUESTION: You tell me about the reg.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Right, right. So, number two,\nabout -- about the reg, it seems to me that in some of the\nextreme cases, a lot of them, maybe all of them, the\nperson will fail on the qualified individual standard. A\nperson who's going to die by -- simply by walking on the\njob, simply is unable to perform essential functions --\nQUESTION: You're not telling me about the reg.\nI want to know how to avoid -- from your point of view,\nyou want me to avoid the fact that I owe deference to a\nreg of the agency. So, I want to know. I know the normal\nrule is I owe that deference. So, what's special about\nthis in respect to that?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I -- I think that the\nquestion -- the question is, as I said, whether Congress\nhas spoken to the matter with respect to whether an\nemployer can exclude an individual based on risk to self,\nand we say that Congress has spoken to that matter in\n12113(b), the direct threat provision.\nQUESTION: Sure, but the -- the question is how\nplainly. And -- and here's the problem that I have, just\nas a technical matter, without even getting to the\nsuicidal patient.\nYou make a very good argument about the contrast\nbetween what Congress wrote in the old EEOC regs. As\nagainst the force of that argument, you've got the text of\nthe statute that refers to the qualifications, including\nthreats to others. So, in the -- you know, the very\nbreath that they're giving your -- an example, they're\nsaying, and there can be all kinds of other things too.\nIt may very well be -- I don't know. It may\nvery well be that, as Justice Ginsburg suggested earlier,\nthey were talking about other kinds of examples on other\nsubjects. But I don't know. It's not clear to me, and\nthat's the point at which Chevron deference becomes\ncrucial. How can I say it is so plain that Congress was\nexcluding a -- a Chevron treatment?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Okay. Two points, one textual,\none contextual. The textual point, directly on -- on this\nprovision, I think goes back to what Justice Scalia said\nin the first half of the argument which is just because it\nbegins with may include, doesn't mean that everything that\nfollows it -- everything that follows it doesn't place any\nlimitations on everything that precedes may include.\nCongress said, you know, qualification standards may\ninclude a direct threat to others --\nQUESTION: Absolutely, but I don't know how to\ndraw the line. That's my problem.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: And -- and I think the\ncontextual point helps answer that with the -- the\nconsistent statements both in the statutory findings and\nin this provision, the change from the -- from the\nRehabilitation Act regs, and consistently in the\nlegislative history, including that specifically referring\nto this particular provision saying the reason why we cut\nthis language out basically is in order to say that\npaternalistic determinations, determinations by employers\nfor the safety of employees, for the safety of the\nparticular excluded employees, should not be permitted to\njustify --\nQUESTION: Okay. But that gets back to the\npoint that several have raised and that is paternalism\ncombined with stereotype, yes, I understand. That's out.\nJohnson Controls is out.\nBut paternalism alone? Particularly where, as\nJustice Scalia has said, paternalism for the -- for the\nnon-disabled is -- is alive and well in OSHA. That's --\nthat's not so easy for -- for me to follow.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Paternalism for everybody, the\nnon-disabled, as well as the disabled --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: -- taken as a whole -- I -- I\nagree is taken kind of as part of the OSHA.\nI -- I think that it's certainly, as -- as I\nmeant to say in response to Justice Scalia's question,\nthere certainly is a concern for stereotyping here. The\nquestion is whether Congress meant to permit -- or meant\nto require employees to have to prove stereotyping in each\ncase. That is -- that is, Congress could have made a\nclass-based decision that most of the time when we have an\nexclusion of an individual with a disability because of a\nconclusion that his disability makes him unsafe, that --\nthat is likely to be informed by some degree of\nstereotyping or the -- the incentives that -- that\nemployers' doctors have to exclude people rather than hire\nthem and take the steps necessary to protect them as the\nAmerican Public Health Association makes clear in its\nbrief. So, stereotyping is --\nQUESTION: So, that may -- that may simply get\nus down to a very important point but not a point here,\nand that is, the -- a sufficiency of evidence point or a\n-- or a sufficient specificity of evidence point. And\nthat's -- that's not what we've got.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, the problem -- right. I\nthink that's right. I think Congress then has two\nchoices. Do you require plaintiffs to prove in every case\nthat there is stereotyping in addition to paternalism? Or\ndo you presume essentially paternalism entails\nstereotyping when it's paternalistic discrimination? It's\nnot paternalism at large, not paternalism visited on all\nemployees. And I think that Congress, given the history\nrecounted over and over in -- in the hearings, was\nentitled to say that we're just going to make a -- a broad\nclass of --\nQUESTION: Did it say that? That's the question\nwe're all interested in. It certainly was entitled to\nsay, but I don't believe you can point to any particular\nplace where it specifically says that.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I think that -- I think\nthat the closest is that just as the direct threat\nprovision excludes an indirect threat as a basis for --\nfor excluding someone, so too does the threat to others\nlanguage there exclude threats to self.\nQUESTION: Yes, but you -- you have to push\nbeyond the analogy from direct threat to indirect threat\nto -- to get that far out.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I -- I don't -- I don't\nknow that you have to push beyond the analogy. I mean,\nit's -- I would -- I would say, with respect, it seemed --\nit seems like it's precisely parallel statutory language.\nThere are two limitations in the 12113(b) direct\nthreat provision. One is direct threat defined as\nsignificant risk, and the other is risk to others. It\nseems like if you're going to override either of those\nlimitations under the guise of the general 12113(a)\nqualification standards defense, then any purpose Congress\nhad for including those limitations in that direct threat\nprovision is -- is going to be rendered meaningless.\nAnd so -- so, I think that's the concern there.\nAnd this is not -- this is not a concern that's -- that's\nunique to the ADA. It's a concern that this Court\napproached under Title VII.\nI think the important answer that -- I'd like to\nget back to Justice Kennedy's point before -- is that this\nis not a statute, even under our reading, that prevents\nemployers from taking steps, taking lots of steps, to\nprotect their employees. It just eliminates one thing\nthey might do, and that is simply exclude an employee who,\nbecause of a disability, is determined to -- to pose an\nundue risk.\nQUESTION: May I ask you to comment on a\nhypothetical that I -- I can't -- haven't quite been able\nto think through? Assume that the -- that an employee has\nto be able to lift at least 200 pounds in order to be safe\nin a particular assignment. And one employee can't lift\n200 pounds because he's just not any stronger than a lot\nof other people, and another employee can't do it because\nhe's disabled. Could they fire -- could they deny the\nemployment of the disabled person in that hypo?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: I think that that would be a\nneutral qualification standard. That's the paradigm case\nof a neutral qualification standard. That is what\n12113(a) is about. Asking everybody --\nQUESTION: So, if the -- if Standard Oil had a\n-- had a qualification that anyone with hepatitis beyond a\ncertain degree is ineligible for employment, that would be\nokay?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I think the point -- the\npoint of its neutrality in the lifting hypothetical --\nQUESTION: Some -- some neutral standard that\nwhatever -- they phrase it in medical terms, and if you\ncross the threshold, you're at too much of a risk and\nwe'll -- we won't employ you.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I think if they have to\nask themselves what is your medical condition, do you have\nhepatitis C, which hepatitis C is a disability in this\ncase, then it's no longer neutral. Then what they're\ndoing is engaging in intentional discrimination against\nthat person because of his condition. If, on the other\nhand, what they say is we require everybody to lift 200\npounds, we don't care if the reason you can't lift 200\npounds is because --\nQUESTION: Well, then you're discriminating\nagainst people with hernias probably.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Well, it -- it would certainly screen\nout people with hernias, and -- and therefore would prima\nfacie violate the screening out provision of -- of the\nstatute unless there were a business necessity\njustification. This is precisely the context in which\nthere would be a business necessity justification under\nthe statute where -- where an employer says we require\neverybody to satisfy the standard. We don't care. We\ndon't even ask what's the reason why you can't lift. We\ngive you 200 pounds and say, lift if for us, and if you\ncan't do it --\nQUESTION: What if the employer says, we require\neverybody to have a prognosis of living for at least 2\nyears on the job?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Right. If the employer did\nthat, I mean, I think -- I think that that would be\nsomething -- that would be something that goes a lot\ncloser to a qualification standard that is neutral. Now,\nthe concern in that case is, number one, is it really\nneutral? That is, is it the case that they say only to\npeople with disabilities, people with medical conditions\nthat constitute disabilities, we think that you fail this\ntest.\nQUESTION: No, but I'm talking about just across\nthe board. One of the things that we require, regardless\nof what you're condition is, is we want -- we want your\nlife expectancy to be at least 2 years.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: I think that they could do that\nif they could justify it as job-related and consistent\nwith business necessity, which might be very difficult.\nThe business justification I suppose would be we don't\nwant turnover in employment, but there's a lot of turnover\nfor a lot --\nQUESTION: No age discrimination problem here?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BAGENSTOS: There might well be an age\ndiscrimination problem there. Disparate effects, you\nknow, depending on whether disparate effect is recognized\nunder that statute.\nBut -- but under -- as far as the ADA is\nconcerned, certainly it's the case that they would be able\nto assert a business justification, but I think it would\nbe difficult in that case to actually prove the business\njustification because it's only -- if it's only people who\nare going to die in 2 years, however we predict that, who\nare excluded from employment and not people who are going\nto take a better job, not people who are going to leave\nbecause they fall in love and move to a different city or\nleave to take care of a sick parent -- I mean, there are\nthousands of reasons why job turnover occurs. If they\nsingle out something that screens out people with\ndisabilities, that's obviously very different.\nBut the crucial point, it seems -- it seems to\nme, is that in this case what we have and in the class of\ncases on which the legal question presented addresses --\nwhat we have is a choice effectively of who's going to\ndecide whether a job is too risky for a particular\nindividual in a context where there are general rules like\nOSHA that are complied with.\nQUESTION: Well, let the doctor decide.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I think that the\nindividual will certainly -- will certainly follow the\ndictates of his own doctor in most cases. And when the\nindividual doesn't, I mean, there are obviously cases\nwhere people --\nQUESTION: I'm afraid you haven't thought about\nthe Christian Scientists in this -- in this community.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Right. Well, I mean, I think --\nI think that raises obviously distinct issues.\nBut -- but yes, I think that -- people will\nobviously consult with their doctors. I mean, what's --\nwhat's notable here is that Chevron purported to consult\nwith Echazabal's doctor, didn't really give him all the\ninformation, didn't get it, didn't ask him whether there\nwas a significant risk, but never put the doctor in\ncontact with Echazabal, just purported to have --\nQUESTION: Well, that goes to the issue on\nremand if there is one.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Right, no --\nQUESTION: It's not the legal --\nMR. BAGENSTOS: I -- I agree with that. I -- I\nagree with that really does go --\nQUESTION: But if we're focusing on our concern\nabout extreme cases, of which this may not be one, have\nyou thought of a form of words that might cabin those off\nif they ever occur, which would give some meaning to the\nreg?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: I --\nQUESTION: And what's the form of words?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: I don't know that I can give any\nmeaning to the reg that's --\nQUESTION: If you can -- if you apply it, you\ncould think of an extreme case where the person is -- you\nknow, the suicidal worker, I'm going to die with my boots\non and I hope tomorrow. I mean, there may be such people,\nand -- and okay. So, that's what maybe this reg is about.\nI don't know. It doesn't say it isn't. And -- and what's\nthe form of words that would cabin off those cases?\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I think that the cabining\nwould have to be external to the regulation. I think it's\n-- I think it's -- to -- to say --\nQUESTION: Well, give me the form of words,\nhowever you want to do it.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Okay. And I think that the\ncabining is threefold. Number one, an employer can\nexclude someone who is not a qualified individual with a\ndisability, which many people who pose such an extreme\npresent risk themselves will be. Number two, an employer\ncan apply neutral qualification standards that are job-\nrelated and consistent with business necessity. And\nnumber three, if we have someone who really is bent on\ncommitting suicide by employment, there are State law\ncommitment remedies available for such people, people who\ncan't --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BAGENSTOS: And no --\nQUESTION: I mean, that's -- that's extreme. I\nmean, people may want to die with their boots on. There\nare a lot of things that move people. Some don't believe\nit, et cetera. So, is there a serious form of words that\nyou could say, well, if it's really one of those cases, it\nmight be a -- a situation that falls within the reg? And\nyou're telling me the answer to that question is no.\nThere is no form of words.\nMR. BAGENSTOS: I -- I think outside of the\nsituation -- the first two situations that I spoke of\nwhere the person isn't qualified or where the person is\nexcluded under a neutral job-related and consistent with\nbusiness necessity qualification standard, that I would\nsuspect excludes everybody except what we've now described\nas the really extreme cases.\nQUESTION: In order to avoid paternalism, we're\ngoing to tell employers they can just commit their\nemployees.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BAGENSTOS: Well, I think the crucial point\nis that, I mean, there are due process limitations on\ncommitment which there are not for employers. And that's\nthe crucial point, Justice Kennedy. If -- if we say that\nemployers get to decide willy-nilly this is too unsafe,\nthat's -- that's a very different kind of a process. Of\ncourse, commitment is only in a very extreme circumstance,\nand we have procedures to make sure that independent\ndecision makers make those decisions with full knowledge\nof the facts not employers here and then forcing --\nforcing employees to come to court and fight for 6 years\nto prove that they really weren't a risk to themselves.\nAnd -- and that we think is the reason why Congress\nexcluded the -- excluded the notion that an employer could\nmake the decision instead of the employee as to what is\ntoo unsafe.\nAnd we would then submit that the court of\nappeals judgment should be affirmed.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Bagenstos.\nMr. Shapiro, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SHAPIRO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJustice Stewart's opinion for the Court in the\nDothard case contained an excellent rebuttal to the\nargument we've just heard. He stated that safety is not\nromantic paternalism. Safety is a basic business\nnecessity in this country. That's the culmination of 100\nyears of industrial policy.\nQUESTION: Mr. Shapiro, I thought that was\nsafety of others because didn't Dothard make the\ndistinction between the -- the risk to the individual\nwoman, which was up to her? What Dothard said is, this\nprison is a jungle. By her presence, she is endangering\neveryone else in the place. There are going to be riots.\nSo, I think Dothard doesn't work for you at all.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, we think it does. The Court\ndiscussed both kinds of danger, danger to the individual\nand danger to other people. And this Court twice has said\nin Dothard -- in Beezer -- the Beezer case later -- that\nsafety is a paradigm business necessity. And indeed, it\n-- it is the paradigm, safe and efficient operations of\nbusiness.\nAnd this is not a statute that cut out risks to\nself. This is a statute that included risks to self in\nthe business necessity defense. That's generic language\nthat encompasses it. And there was a long line of cases\nthat Congress meant to adopt under the Rehab Act. They\ndidn't disapprove those cases. In fact, business\nnecessity is repeated four different times in the statute,\nand it's applied specifically to medical examinations of\nthe individual employee. Congress wasn't talking about\ngeneral tests. It was talking about examinations like the\none given to Mr. Echazabal.\nNow, this Court has held that under the business\nnecessity defense, it will not substitute its judgment for\nthe employer's judgment. All that is needed is a\nreasonable relationship to a legitimate business\nobjective. There certainly is a legitimate business\nobjective here in saving this individual's life and\npromoting safety in the plant.\nWas the judgment a reasonable one? We had four\nopinions from experienced physicians. We spoke with Mr.\nEchazabal's own physician. We told him, did you realize\nthis man would be exposed to liver toxins, and he said,\nno, that should not be done. Someone with hepatitis C\ncan't even have a drink of alcohol, much less liver\ntoxins.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nShapiro.\n"
