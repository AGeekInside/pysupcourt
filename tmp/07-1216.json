        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 07-1216, Philip Morris v.\nWilliams.\nMr. Shapiro.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SHAPIRO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nWe are here today because the Oregon court\nfailed to follow this Court's directions on remand and\nbecause the ground it gave is not adequate to show a\nforfeiture of due process rights.\nThis -- this Court vacated after finding\nthat the Oregon Supreme Court applied the wrong\nconstitutional standard, and it remanded with directions\nto apply the standard that the Court laid out. But the\nOregon court didn't do that. It never even addressed\nthe constitutional issue. The Oregon court, of course,\nrefused to follow this Court's direction because it\nbelieved there were mistakes in another paragraph in our\ninstruction request dealing with what the court referred\nto as \"unrelated issues.\"\nBut that isn't what this Court mandated.\nAnd the specific forfeiture theory adopted here for the\nfirst time after nine years of appellate litigation is\ncompletely inadequate to avoid this mandate.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shapiro, we are\ndealing with a State supreme court, and our bottom line\nalways reads \"for further proceedings not inconsistent\nwith this opinion.\" And it was my understanding that a\nState court can resolve a case on an alternate State law\nground, if there is such a ground in the case.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes, Your Honor. We believe\nthat this disposition is quite inconsistent with what\nthe Court mandated. The Court heard arguments in this\ncase about the \"correct in all respects\" rule, but it\nstill mandated an application of the constitutional\nstandard, including the prohibition on punishment for\nharm to non-parties, and that standard simply was never\napplied. We say that is inconsistent with this Court's\nopinion.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it seems to me the\nproblem with the argument is that to say it is\ninconsistent with the opinion we implicitly have to say\nthat the Oregon Supreme Court has to confront State law\nissues in a certain sequence, and that if it does not do\nso those issues are waived, as it were, not only by the\ncourt but by the party who raised it. And the\ndifficulty, I think, with your position here is that on\nthe assumption, which I do make, that the -- that the\nissue, \"correct in all respect\" issue, was properly\nraised by the other side, if we accept your position, we\nin effect are saying the other side is not going to have\nan opportunity to argue that before the Oregon Supreme\nCourt. And that's, it seems to me, kind of a steep hill\nfor you to climb.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, we don't say that the\ncourt can never adopt a State law standard after remand\nfrom this Court, but we say that this disposition is\ninconsistent --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I know you are saying that\nbut why -- why does the disposition that you are asking\nfor not entail what I just said, and that is, in effect\nyou cut off the claim by a party raised before the\nOregon Supreme Court, not considered by the Oregon\nSupreme Court, and you cut off that claim simply because\nthe Oregon Supreme Court chose to approach the issues in\nthe case in a certain sequence? What business do we\nhave to do that?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, because the preservation\nissue was debated before this Court and it adopted a\nspecific order here saying on remand now consider the\nconstitutional standard, which is the prohibition on --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I know the language that\nyou are referring to.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the referring to that\nlanguage simply skips over the issue that I am trying to\nraise. Isn't there a problem that we should be\nconcerned with if we accept your position in cutting off\nthe claim made by one party to the case which was never\nheard by the Oregon Supreme Court?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, Your Honor, this is very\nsimilar to what occurred in the Sullivan case in this\nCourt, where the issue of preservation was debated\nbefore this Court at the cert stage in the cert papers,\nand the Court said: We sub silentio passed on the\nadequacy of the State ground when we CDRed the case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't -- did the\nCourt -- suppose the -- what is it called -- \"correct in\nall respects\" had been raised and decided by the Oregon\nSupreme Court in the first instance. Suppose it had\nsaid, well, we don't have to deal with whether\nInstruction 34 was right or wrong in this particular,\nbecause it was wrong in other respects. Suppose that\nhad been the first time around what the Oregon Supreme\nCourt said. Would that have offended any Federal due\nprocess? Would that have been an appropriate\ndisposition for the Oregon Supreme Court to make?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, that takes us to our\nsecond and principal argument, which is that that ground\nwould not be adequate under this Court's criteria for\nadequacy. And we say that there are really three\nreasons why that would not be an adequate ground for\nforfeiting this constitutional right. It's an ambush.\nIt was a surprise ruling that we couldn't anticipate.\nIt is an exercise in futility because, even if we\nsubmitted a perfect instruction that complied with that\nrule, we would have been rejected anyway by the trial\ncourt that simply believed that this instruction wasn't\nrequired by the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the place to make\nthat argument in the Oregon Supreme Court?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, no. The Oregon Supreme\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Wouldn't it have been\nappropriate to -- to hear the -- the issue that they are\nraising and for you to make the reply that you have just\nmade?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Your Honor, this Court has\nsaid repeatedly that adequacy is a Federal law question\nfor this Court to decide.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I realize it's a Federal\nlaw question and in approaching that question, I keep\nasking the question which I think I have now put to you\nthree times and have yet to hear an answer on the merits\non: Why is it appropriate for us to have a rule here\nthat cuts off the right of a party that properly raised\nan issue in the Oregon Supreme Court and has yet to be\nheard on the merits in the Oregon Supreme Court?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, there are two reasons.\nFirst under the adequacy decisions of this Court,\nincluding Lee v. Kemna, if it takes years and years\nafter the trial to articulate a forfeiture rule like\nthis that counts heavily against the adequacy of the\nState ground. This Court held that in Lee v. Kemna very\nrecently.\nAnd then secondly, this is a point that was\nargued to this Court four separate times now and when\nthe Court remanded with explicit directions to apply the\nconstitutional standard that's something that had to be\ndone on remand. The Court did not invite the lower\ncourt to get into the question of whether this request\nwas made. The Court found that the request was made.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe -- maybe this Court\ninsufficiently appreciated the significance of the issue\nwhich is now before us. And I still want to know, is\nthere a good reason on the merits why it is fair for us\nto cut off the right of the other side to raise an issue\nthat they raise or to argue an issue that they raised in\na timely fashion?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes, there is a good reason,\nbecause this is -- adequacy is ultimately a Federal\nquestion for this Court to decide. The issue was\ndebated here four separate times at great length. The\nCourt remanded for a specific decision by the lower\ncourt. That wasn't done. And if we turn to the\nadequacy doctrine --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. What -- what\nissue was debated here four times?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Whether or not there was an\nadequate State ground because of the \"correct in all\nrespects\" rule. That was debated in the merits brief,\nin the cert oppositions twice. It was debated again in\nthe cert opposition this time around. But the Court has\nnever accepted it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the State court hadn't\nruled on it at that time.\nMR. SHAPIRO: That's correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So how do we rule on it as\na matter of first impression?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, because, Your Honor, the\nCourt considered, just as it did in Sullivan, it\nconsidered these issues in the cert papers and then\nremanded the case for a different issue to be decided by\nthe lower court.\nBut we don't hesitate from debating the\nadequacy issue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did our opinion decide that\n-- that question? Did our opinion say that that\nquestion was decided against your opponent?\nMR. SHAPIRO: No. What the Court said in\nSullivan was that it was a sub silentio determination.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How could we have\ndetermined it when the Oregon Supreme Court itself\nhadn't made any determination?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Because the parties debated\nthis extensively in their briefs.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we don't decide\nquestions, particularly questions of State law, that may\nhave a Federal check. But we don't decide them in the\nfirst instance.\nAnd there's one point, Mr. Shapiro, that I\nthink affects this concern of fairness to the parties\nwho raised this \"correct in all respects\" from the\nbeginning. This Court had not clarified, had it, until\nthe Williams case itself, the rule about harm to others.\nIn State Farm we were talking about harm to\nnonresidents. So if I recall correctly, Williams was\nthe first time we ever clarified that harm to others\nincluded people within the same State; is that correct?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes. That's true.\nThis -- this, as the Court expressed it, was\na slight extension of the previous decisions. But Your\nHonor, if the Court feel that this adequacy issue hasn't\nbeen dealt with previously by this Court, it's presented\nsquarely here. It is a Federal question, which this\nCourt says has to be decided by this Court. And we\ndon't hesitate from --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose one reason\n-- one reason to think it may not have been decided is\nthat, unlike the other situations you have discussed, it\nwould not have been a bar to our consideration of this\ncase the last time because, just as you raise the\nquestion in your second question presented that whether\nthe award complies with due process, we may have thought\nthere might have been an adequate and independent State\nground on a procedural question, but we were going to go\nahead. We granted cert on the substantive question on\nwhether the damages award was unconstitutional.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, Your Honor, if -- if\nwe're not right about the decision resolving the\nadequacy issue already, we're happy to turn to it now\nand address it as we do in our briefs. This is not an\nadequate State ground under this Court's decisions. The\nfirst reason for that is that this is a futile gesture\nthat the State court requires of us.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I want to ask you about\nthat. That's the thrust of your argument: It would\nhave been futile to comply with the specific, drafting a\nperfect -- perfect instruction \"correct in all\nrespects.\" But I have to think the trial -- the record\nis subject to the reading that the trial judge thought\nthe issue had already been adequately taken care of,\nrather than it would be an incorrect instruction.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, the trial judge asked,\nis there any authority that requires me to give this\ninstruction on harm to non-parties? And we said, in our\nview it's the BMW case. And she said, well, if there is\nnot an authority right on point I'm not going to give\nthis instruction. She said that very clearly. So if we\nsubmitted a separate piece of paper, it would have made\nno difference; and if we had taken out the two mistakes\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Where in the record is the\nportion of the colloquy about the instructions most\nclearly stated in your view, on your side of that issue?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Let's see. It's the\ninstruction conference. This begins on page 17a, where\nMr. Beaty starts discussing the second prong of this\nparagraph. He says -- he quotes the language, and the\njudge -- the judge says: \"Well, I think that that's\ncovered by giving an instruction that punitive damages\nare not compensatory.\" And he says: No, no, that is\nnot -- \"That is not the point of this instruction.\"\nThis is pages 17 and 18a.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that's exactly the\npoint I make. I think the trial judge was saying, I\nthink it's already covered, which is different from\nsaying, no matter how you phrase it, I won't give it.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, she said she just\ndisagreed with the idea that there should be protection\nagainst punishment for harm to non-parties. And she\nsaid unless there's a case requiring that, I'm not going\nto give that instruction. And she said --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Didn't she also say that\nshe was going to give, and ultimately did give an\ninstruction, to the effect that punitive damages are\npunitive, they are not for the compensation of this\nperson or any other person, and to -- she then turned to\nPhilip Morris's counsel and said: What about that? And\nPhilip Morris's counsel said okay.\nMR. SHAPIRO: What he was saying when he\nsaid okay was: I understand your ruling and I'm not\ngoing to continue to argue a point that I've already\nlost. But he pressed that point --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It doesn't sound like much\nof an objection.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, the -- the State courts\nboth held -- both of the appellate courts held our\ninstruction was rejected. And this Court said it was\nrejected, too, in its opinion. And that's exactly\nright. You can't antagonize the trial judge by arguing\nand arguing after your position has been rejected.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But -- but the -- the\nproblem that I am having at the moment is that they did\n-- from your point of view, is that they -- the other\nside listed 28 cases in which they said the Oregon\ncourts have followed this rule that the instruction has\nto be good as a whole.\nNow, I have looked up those 28 cases, and\nthey do -- they do say that. They do say it, or they\nimply it, or they apply it. They are not completely on\npoint, but they are not completely out of point, either.\nAnd -- and so I suppose what happened is that the judge\nthere just looked at this instruction on 32(a). It\nlooks like sort of it's all together. It really does\nlook like it's all together, the (1) and the (2). And\nhe ran his eye down the page and he said, well, here are\ntwo other ways in which it's no good, and so that's the\nend of it. You can't raise your objection. Maybe you\nshould have had four instructions instead of one, but\nyou did just have one.\nAnd under Oregon law, unless every part of\nit is right, the judge is correct in not giving it, even\nif he never mentions the other part. And that 28 -- it\ndoes seem as if that's what those 28 cases do say. So\nwhat do we say about that?\nMR. SHAPIRO: The -- the reason we say that\nthose 28 cases did not give us reasonable notice that we\nhad to submit a separate piece of paper or change\nanother paragraph in the instruction request is that\nnone of them dealt with a situation where you have\nseparately numbered requests --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean -- please, I\n-- I don't want to appear skeptical, but I am. And --\nand that's because I have looked up in some of those\ncases, and then I sort of looked at the -- which doesn't\n-- most of them don't give you the instructions, so it's\na little hard to say. But then I looked on page 32(a)\nof this appendix and looked at what your instructions\nlooked like.\nAnd -- and if I were sitting there as a\njudge, I would think, well, gee, that looks like a\nsingle thing there. They have it indented, and they\nhave a (1) and a (2), and it just looks like it's one\nball of wax. So can I really fault this Oregon court\nfor just doing what I said?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, I -- I think so, because\nthe pattern instruction here told both parties to\ninclude all their paragraphs pertaining to punitive\ndamages in one numbered instruction, 34.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, they had some other\nhandbook that says beware of that.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because you are going to\nrun into this rule that says if there is any part of a\nsingle instruction that is wrong, goodbye, even if the\ntrial judge never mentioned it.\nMR. SHAPIRO: But that handbook came out in\n2006. And after all, that was a practice tip. It was\nnot a State court ruling saying you had to organize your\ninstruction this way.\nWe had separate paragraphs, separately\nnumbered. They dealt with different issues. One was\nthe Constitution and the other was the State statute.\nAnd there's no Oregon case that said that in that\nsituation you have to break it out into a separate piece\nof paper.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the notion was\none issue, one charge. And it wasn't in just one\npractice manual. There were a few cited in the brief\nthat the charge should be limited to one issue, one\npoint of law.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, the pattern instructions\ntold us to put every point pertaining to punitive\ndamages in Instruction No. 34. Both sides did that.\nAnd the Court was working with plaintiff's instruction,\ntaking their --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it would be pretty\nodd. Did the person who wrote that read these 28 cases\nor some share thereof? And if you were going to do that\n-- it wasn't you, I know -- why -- why wouldn't you\njust, if you have one instruction, copy the -- the model\ninstruction? Then you won't make errors in the other\nparts.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, you see, the -- the\npattern -- the pattern instruction didn't include the\ndue process point.\nJUSTICE BREYER: True, but you could add\nthat to the pattern.\nMR. SHAPIRO: That's what we tried to do,\nand the -- the judge invited us while dealing with the\nother side's instruction to go through this one by one.\nShe -- she was asking us: Now, what's your next\naddition?\nAnd we -- we got to the due process point,\nand she said: What is your authority? And we told her,\nand she said: I don't think that instruction is\nnecessary.\nIt was separately argued. It was separately\ndecided by the State courts in the prior decisions,\ndecided by this Court as -- as a separate matter, and\nthat is exactly how the trial court approached this.\nHer request was to go through this item by item.\nShe wasn't taking an all-or-nothing approach\nto this instruction. She started with plaintiff's\ndocument and asked what from our menu of additions\nwas necessary.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not speaking of this\nfrom the point of view -- I mean I -- when I read that\npetition for cert, I thought this is a run- around, and\nI'm not sure that I think that now. That is, the reason\nis because I put myself in the position of not the trial\njudge. The person to put yourself in the position of is\nthe Oregon Supreme Court justice. And what he is doing\nis he's reading that instruction. And -- and what can\nyou say in response to what -- what he might have\nthought?\nHe knows this rule. The rule is if the\ninstruction is -- is unfavorable in any part, if it's\nwrong, you are out.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He knows that rule, because\nthere have been a lot of cases on it. And then he reads\nyour instruction, and as I looked carefully -- I didn't\nknow this the first time when it was here, but he said\nbecause it's right in paragraph 1 -- I mean it's wrong\nin paragraph 1, where he was wrong -- I don't have to go\nto the rest of it.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now we send it back, so he\nsays: Okay, now I've got to go to the rest of it.\nMR. SHAPIRO: You know, Justice Breyer, this\nis very similar to what was at issue in the Flowers case\nwhich reached this Court. The Alabama Supreme Court had\nsaid if you intermix different appeal points in your\nbrief, we are not going to consider any of them if there\nare any errors to be found in any of the paragraphs in\ntheir brief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought the whole\nthing about -- this is the NAACP case you that you were\ndiscussing?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that this was\nsomething that the Alabama Supreme Court really sprung\nat the last minute, that it was not like this rule.\nThere were not 28 cases in the Alabama Supreme Court\napplying the rule. It seemed to be quite a novel rule.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, what -- what the State\nargued there was that for 60 years the \"correct in all\nrespects\" rule was in effect in Alabama, and they cited\ndozens of cases applying it. But this Court unanimously\nheld that that approach was pointless severity. Even\nthough the State supreme court there said, we can't\ndisentangle these arguments, it's too complicated, it's\ntoo much of a burden on the State supreme court, this\nCourt unanimously found that was pointless severity.\nAnd at that point --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There was a basis for\nquestioning the good faith of the court in that case, I\nthink.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And I don't think that's\ntrue here.\nMR. SHAPIRO: I -- I -- we don't question\nthe good faith of the court, but we say that this is\npointless severity, a rule that this Court has applied\nmore recently in Lee v. Kemna where there was no issue\nof bad faith. The Court thought that it was pointlessly\nsevere and unnecessarily severe to insist on a perfect\nproposal in that case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The best you have come up\nwith -- and I think you have researched this pretty\nthoroughly -- and the best you have come up with to find\na case where they didn't apply the rule is that George\ncase, right? \"George,\" I think, is the name of it.\nAnd there, there is an alternative ground\nwhich is that the judge had to -- had to give the\ninstruction himself, and it's a criminal case. And we\nShepardized it and it has only been cited twice. And --\nand so I'm slightly at sea, to tell you the truth. And\n-- and what is the standard I'm supposed to use to\ndecide whether that State ground is adequate as a matter\nof Federal law or not?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, there is an earlier case\nthat is interesting, State v. Brown, which comes several\nyears before, and it's cited in our brief. In that case\nan imperfect instructional request was made, and the\nCourt still found that there was a duty to give the\ninstruction based on due process. And the reason was\nthat the parties during the charge conference had\ndebated the issue. It was a fair-enough exposition for\nthe trial court to understand the need for the charge.\nAnd here this really is much like the\nOsborne case. You know, in the Osborne case the\ndefendant didn't make any instructional proposal, and\nthis Court still reversed and required a new trial with\nthe correct instruction. It said due process required\nthat. And the Court said that we -- that the party had\nsufficiently brought this to the attention of the trial\njudge for Federal adequacy purposes even though no\ninstruction was -- was proposed.\nThe lawyer there merely moved to dismiss the\nproceeding, never proposed an instruction, but this\nCourt required a retrial with a correct set of\ninstructions to the jury. That's an a fortiori case, I\nthink; and also the Flowers case, I believe, is a\nfortiori. There really was a strong and compelling\nState interest there in having the lawyers break their\narguments up into separate headings and subheadings so\nthe appellate court could follow the argument.\nBut here there wasn't any burden placed on\nthe trial judge at all by our request. She was going\nthrough these one by one, and she asked us: What's your\nnext point that you want added? We proposed it. It was\non a silver platter. She didn't have to retype it. She\ncould have simply read it to the jury in that form. It\ndidn't have to be edited or amended. There literally\nwas no burden on the trial judge at all. And so we --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: She didn't get to the --\nthe other grounds, because I think it was all about that\nparagraph and whether that paragraph was adequate under\nour then precedent. And I don't think that -- that the\n-- the incorrect portions of the charge that have now --\nare now before us were -- were even reached then.\nMR. SHAPIRO: She did look at the illicit\nprofits point. And she said: I'm not going to give\nthat; that's unnecessary. She did -- she didn't address\nthe \"may versus shall\" issue because she was working\nwith plaintiffs' proposal. So all -- really she just\nhad before her our request for this due process\ninstruction. She analyzed it separately, it was debated\nbefore her.\nAnd this is much more specific than what the\nlawyers did in the Osborne case. They didn't even\npropose an instruction. We served it up on a silver\nplatter. She could have used it, and indeed there was\nno work for the trial judge at all because she was\nsimply telling the lawyers, make this change, make that\nchange that we've discussed, so there is zero burden on\nthe court.\nAnd you have to ask in this situation, what\nis the legitimate State interest that would support this\nmassive forfeiture of a very important due process\nright? The plaintiff says the State interest here is\nthat it promotes affirmance of jury verdicts whether or\nnot there has been a due process violation. But think\nabout that. That's hardly a State interest.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The State interest in the\nrule in general, I take it, is to require the lawyers,\nif they are going to object to the instructions that the\njudge is going to give, to produce an instruction that\nis a correct instruction of the law. That's -- that's\nwhy, I guess, they have this rule.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- and you'd better get\nit right, because if you don't get it right, you're\ngoing to lose your ability to claim that the judge was\nwrong in refusing to give any part of it.\nNow, if that's the reason they have that\nrule, that would seem to apply as much in this case as\nin any other case. Why wouldn't it?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, please recall that in\nboth Osborne and in the Lee case, there was a general\nState purpose of that kind that supported the rule, but\nthe Court said it was an exorbitant or unnecessarily\nsevere application of the rule. And that's what we\ncontend here, that this is exorbitant, it serves no\nlegitimate purpose. It is truly a game of gotcha that\njust nullifies the defendant's due process rights.\nAnd that precedent I think would be of great\nconcern in various fields of law. This is a rule of law\nthat will apply in civil rights cases in the future,\ncriminal cases, all sorts of cases.\nSo I -- I think if this Court does apply its\nown criteria here, it will see that this is an exercise\nin futility, it was an ambush as a practical matter. We\ndidn't have any reason to think we had to submit this\nagain on a separate piece of paper.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could you just tell me,\nwell, why was it an exercise in futility? That's what I\ndon't quite understand.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, because the judge had\nruled as a matter of substantive law that she wasn't\ngoing to give this instruction. It wouldn't matter if\nwe separated it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But she said she thought\nit was already covered. That's what I -- on that very\npage you pointed me to.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, she -- she said that was\nall she was going to say about the point. And we said,\nwell, that doesn't cover our point, because we want\nprotection against punishment for harm to non-parties.\nAnd she said: I'm not going to give that instruction; I\ndeny the rest of your request, No. 34.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And where is this\ncolloquy? I mean, we went through the parts, she said I\nthink it's covered and it was okay. You seem to be\nsaying more than ws included in that colloquy.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, I -- I think if -- if\nyou look at the whole colloquy, that's the gist of it.\nI -- I have paraphrased it, but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You've made it much\nclearer than it was.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Perhaps --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- perhaps I did. But I -- I\nwould just point out that in Osborne the lawyer didn't\nmake it clear at all. The lawyer didn't even propose an\ninstruction.\nWe proposed a good instruction that this\nCourt has quoted from emphasizing our language,\nsaying -- saying it correctly captures the due process\nprinciple. So that is enough to satisfy Federal\ncriteria of -- of adequacy, and that is sufficient to\npreserve the point. There is no dispute that this is\npreserved for appellate purposes in Oregon.\nUnless the Court has further questions, I --\nI would reserve the balance of our time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nShapiro.\nMr. Peck.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. PECK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. PECK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court's constitutional mandate in this\ncase is conditioned in several significant respects, and\nit invites the discretion and judgment of a State court\nthat's applying it. First of all, it says that States\nhave flexibility in coming up with a procedure to\naddress this procedural due process issue.\nIt also says that it has to be an\nappropriate case; there has to be a significant risk of\njuror confusion, and a request. There's no indication\nin the opinion that this Court intended to federalize\nthe State procedure over how that request occurs.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't dispute\nthat it's a Federal question whether that procedure is\nadequate and independent?\nMR. PECK: I do not, but I also submit that\nit is more than adequate. Exist -- what the Oregon\nSupreme Court decided was that the existing procedure\npermitting a limiting instruction to be requested -- in\nOregon it's Rule 105, same language as in the Federal\nrule -- and such a request has to be timely, it has to\nbe specific, it has to be on the record. And Oregon\nprecedent says that when we mean specific, the proponent\nhas to give us the exact language -- this is part of the\nparty presentation principle -- the exact language that\nthey are asking us to use.\nAnd that means that we also apply our\ntraditional 92-year-old rule that requests for\ninstruction must be clear and correct in all respects.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The problem --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would say the 28 cases\nare not quite as clear as I suggested. That is, I\ncouldn't find in those 28 cases really a comparable\nsituation.\nMR. PECK: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In each instance it seemed\nas if one of two things was the case: Either, A, where\nthe instruction was in error, it really was the matter\nbrought up in the first place, or the court said, but he\ngave the essence of the instruction he wanted anyway.\nNow, which of those cases do you think -- I\nam leading up to, what of -- what of those cases do you\nthink is your best support, because I couldn't -- they\nare not perfect.\nMR. PECK: I would look first at\nReyes-Camarena, which is a 2000 -- a 2000 decision\ninvolving the death penalty. And there, there were two\nparts of this request, in a single request. The request\nasked for a mitigating factors instruction, which the\ncourt found was correct on the law and -- and would have\nbeen given had it been asked for separately.\nBut it also asked the jury to consider\nsympathy for the defendant, which they found to be\ncontrary to Oregon law, and therefore, it was not error\nfor the trial court to have refused this.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What -- what you can't tell\nfrom that is what was the part of the sympathy\ninstruction that they thought was wrong, and was the\npart that they thought was wrong really part and parcel\nof the part that the -- that the appellant was\ncomplaining about.\nMR. PECK: Well, the court, though, did cite\na prior decision that talked about a sympathy\ninstruction and claimed that this one was no different\nthan that. It was contained in a single instruction.\nIt makes clear, the opinion does, on that.\nOwings v. Rose is that another case which\nboth parties have cited. And in Owings, it's very\nclear. There you have two different parts of an\ninstruction that are offered at the same time, and --\nand one part is right. And this -- this one deals with\nthird party liability.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I remember that,\nbecause they said on that one -- some floor covering\nthing, wasn't it, that they had some liability for bad\nfloors or designing the floors wrong --\nMR. PECK: If --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If that's the case, what\nthey said was: Don't worry about it because basically\nhe did give you the instruction that you wanted, though\nin a different way --\nMR. PECK: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and besides that, they\nadded --\nMR. PECK: And besides that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're right.\nMR. PECK: -- this was an alternate ground.\nThen in Hotelling v. Walther, a 1944 case,\nthe proposed instruction consist -- consisted of three\nseparate sentences, and the Court does reprint that\ninstruction. And each of those sentences has a\ndifferent legal proposition in it. And it was only the\nlast sentence, the third proposition, that the Court\nfound to be in error, and therefore, found that there\nwas no error in failing to give this instruction because\nit was not clear and correct in all respects.\nI -- I think that that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In the last one, what I\nhave here is that the court said the so-called requested\ninstruction was never requested at all --\nMR. PECK: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- at all.\nMR. PECK: But I do not believe that that\nwas the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the -- what is the\n-- I will go look at that again. But what is the\nstandard? I mean, remember, I think what your brother\nsaid at the end is correct. Imagine that yours is a\ndeath case and we have said as a matter of Federal law\nthat this execution is unconstitutional, and then we\nsend it back. And the court then says: Oh, we forgot;\nthere are a couple of matters of State law here that bar\nthe Federal consideration of the death question. And\nhere they are. And then they come up with just this.\nIs this -- is this a situation where you\nwould be equally -- that's my problem. And so, put\nyourself in my shoes and -- and tell me what you would\ndo if this is the death case and not the case that you\nhave?\nMR. PECK: Well, you know, it's -- it's hard\nto get my arms around your hypothetical, because I don't\nknow the grounds on which --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm just imagining that\nwhat has happened is that the instruction that they have\ngiven for the defendant in the death case violates\nFederal law, and then we send it back, and what happens\nis that the State court says, oh, it may violate Federal\nlaw all right, but it's -- the Federal court is blocked\nfrom considering it because there are these two other\nState grounds that mean that the lawyer --\nMR. PECK: I understand.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. PECK: But -- but the question would be\nthen, why would that be a situation like this, where the\ntrial judge -- contrary to your assumption,\nJustice Ginsburg -- the trial judge did find that there\nwere other parts of the instructions offered by Philip\nMorris that were incorrect on the law, and the illicit\nprofits was one of them.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't the trial judge\njust stop there? I mean, if this is the ruling in the\nState --\nMR. PECK: Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- once the trial judge\nfound that one of the other instructions was bad, he\ncould have just said, I throw the whole thing out. Why\ndid he go to all the trouble of going into this, the\ngoverning one?\nMR. PECK: This is -- this is a process.\nCounsel in the case in a trial in Oregon can offer\ninstructions every -- a proffered instruction up to the\npoint when the jury is instructed under their law. So\nPhilip Morris had the opportunity to correct it. The\npractical nature of a charge conference is that the\nparties come in with their proposed instructions. The\nplaintiffs followed the pattern instruction, which by\nthe way does not require enumeration.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you are\nacknowledging that the trial court did not apply the\nrule --\nMR. PECK: The -- it's not a rule of trial\nprocedure. It's a rule of appellate review.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I -- yes,\nthat's exactly right. And I think the purpose for the\nrule is to avoid confusion about the ground of decision\nfor the trial court. If you have got two errors, and\nshe says the instruction's no good, on appellate review\nyou don't know which basis was at issue. There is no\ndoubt here the basis on which the trial court was\nruling, is there?\nMR. PECK: I believe there is -- there --\nfirst of all the trial judge rejected this instruction\non multiple grounds, and made it clear that the illicit\nprofits request was contrary to the Oregon statute that\nsets up the criteria. She found other parts confusing\nand contradictory. But -- and -- but there are two\nthings that I think are significant here.\nYou have to look at what was discussed\nhere. The trial judge, if you turn to 21a of the joint\nappendix: \"We are not here to punish for other\nplaintiffs' harms. We are here to punish, if we are\nhere to punish at all, for the conduct that caused harm\nto Jesse Williams on or after September 1, 1988.\" This\nsounds very much like an acceptance of the rule that\nPhilip Morris was advocating.\nOn 19a she says: \"These punitive damages\nare not designed to compensate for other plaintiffs who\nare not here. \" On 20a there is a colloquy; she\nexpresses her belief that the risk is adequately guarded\nagainst, suggests language to express that, and asks:\n\"Does that get you where you need to be?\"\nThat's when Philip Morris's counsel says\n\"Okay.\" She had every reason to believe that she had\nsatisfied it. She then follows up.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do we give any weight in\nthe case to the fact that the instruction that the\nPetitioners now request and the rule had not really been\nannounced clearly as of the time of this trial? It's\nnot exactly a new rule, but let's -- for our sake we\nwill call it a new rule. Does that have any weight?\nMR. PECK: I don't think it does.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it does in our cause\nand prejudice jurisprudence. In habeas, which is also a\ncivil action --\nMR. PECK: I understand.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- we say there is an\noverarching Federal principle that allows; because of\ncause and prejudice, we can consider the Federal issue.\nWe do that all the time. Those cases weren't raised by\nthe Petitioner, but it seems to me they're quite\nrelevant here, especially when you consider the\nimportance of the constitutional issue, which was not\nreally -- let's face it -- clear to counsel on either\nside of the aisle or to the trial judge.\nMR. PECK: Well, here's the reason why I\nthink in the context of this record, and -- and this\nlitigant, it is not significant. And that is, if you\nlook at 21a, the appendix in our -- our merit brief,\nthere we have Philip Morris in another smoker trial in\nOregon offering up a requested instruction on this\nissue. This is in 2002, so it's well before this\nCourt's decision in this case.\nIt's even before State Farm v. Campbell, and\nthe requested instruction says, one sentence: \"You are\nnot to impose punishment for harms suffered by persons\nother than the plaintiff before you.\"\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the trial judge didn't\nhave the benefit of -- of the ruling that this Court has\nsubsequently made on that point. The trial judge in\nfact here said: Now, if you can give me a case, then I\nwill give you an instruction; you can't give me a case.\nAnd she was right.\nMR. PECK: But she -- but that's actually\nnot the same issue that she asked that on. Counsel\ncited page 17a of the joint appendix for that question.\nAnd if you look at the bottom of 16a, her question:\n\"Let me stop first and go back to the proportionality\npoint you are making. \" This is the ratio point, the\nsecond guidepost of BMW v. Gore. She says: \"Is there\ncase law that says the trial court shall, in order to\nhave a constitutional instruction, tell the jury about\nproportionality?\" And this is where he says: It's\naddressed post-verdict. She asks: Is there any case\nlaw; and she says: No, I'm not going to go there. I'm\nnot going to go where no judge has gone before, because\nshe did not want to be reversed.\nSo she is trying to be careful, and I think\nyou have to credit the Oregon --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I -- it sounds\nto me like that you are confirming my concerns.\nMR. PECK: No. I -- I think that what she\nsaid is as to the proportionality issue. On the other\nissue, she even returns to it later when Philip Morris\nbring up a different issue with respect to punitive\ndamages.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh. Oh, you're -- you are\nsaying that if our law had been clear at the time, that\nshe still wouldn't have given the instruction?\nMR. PECK: No. I'm saying that she thought\nshe was complying with that. She stated on the record\nthat: We are not here to punish for other plaintiffs'\nharms. Later on that other issue, if you look at 28a --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So your -- your contention\nis, is that this trial court and the counsel in the case\nhad all the guidance necessary to give the correct\ninstruction --\nMR. PECK: She --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- before -- before we\neven announced the rule?\nMR. PECK: She seemed to accept -- she\naccepted the point before you announced the rule, and\nthe Oregon Court of Appeals ruling in the Estate of\nSchwarz case where they offered that one-sentence\ninstruction, reversed the verdict, in part because that\ninstruction they said should have been given. So they\nanticipated this Court's rule. I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To move -- to move\nfrom the trial court to the appellate court, if you are\ncorrect that there is this routine, clear rule of State\nprocedure, why would the appellate court say, in its\nhead, well, I could rely on that, but I want to decide\nthis complicated, difficult rule of Federal\nconstitutional law instead?\nMR. PECK: Well, in fact, the -- the court\nthought it was relying on it. In each of the previous\niterations in the Oregon Court of Appeals and in the\nOregon Supreme Court, they cited this rule, \"clear and\ncorrect in all respects,\" in order to reject the \"harm\nto others\" instruction because they said it was\ninconsistent with State law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think we just\nmade a mistake in going ahead and reaching the Federal\nprocedural rule that we reached because it was barred by\nthis adequate and independent State ground that the\nOregon courts had relied upon?\nMR. PECK: No. What I'm saying is that they\nwent further then, and this is what gave this Court the\nauthority to rule on that substantive issue. They said\nthat that request was inconsistent with the Oregon\nstatute. And they did so -- on page 48a of the\npetition, where they say: \"In Williams 1, the Court of\nAppeals concluded that the instruction was incorrect\nunder State law. We agree.\"\nAnd then again on page 52a, they note that:\n\"That is not correct as an independent matter of Oregon\nlaw respecting the conduct of juri trials and\ninstructions\" --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then I think\nyour --\nMR. PECK: But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I think your\nanswer -- go ahead with your but.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PECK: But then they went on to say:\n\"And nothing in due process requires us to look at this\ndifferently.\" That's where they made their error. That\nwas the constitutional mistake that the Oregon court\nmade. They thought they were wrong on a State ground.\nThey thought there was no Federal issue addressing that,\nand so they decided that they didn't have to reach any\nother State law issues. And they ignored the well\npreserved objections that Mrs. Williams made to the\nother parts of this unified instruction on punitive\ndamages.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sorry. I\nstill don't see that answer. You are saying they said\nyes, there was this rule of Oregon law, but you can\nstill reach -- there might still be a Federal due\nprocess issue, so we just can't rely on that. And if\nthat's true, then that seems to me to be a concession\nthat this is not an adequate and independent State\nground that would bar consideration of a Federal\nconstitutional issue.\nMR. PECK: What was not an adequate on\nindependent State grounds was their decision that the\nOregon statute which permits you to punish a misconduct\nin order to deter others from doing that allowed\npunishment for harm to non-parties.\nThat part was their interpretation of the\nstatute, and if there were no due process equation here,\nthat would have been an independent State ground. It\nwas wrong as a matter of due process.\nBut there are other grounds, other mistakes,\nsubstantive mistakes, avoiding law in this instruction.\nAnd any trial court that gave instruction number 34,\nwhich was objected to as a whole, would have committed\nreversible error because they failed to follow the\nOregon statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I think it's\nthe more routine practice for a court, if you have a --\nagain, as you argue -- a clear procedural rule that bars\naddressing the substantive issue, to go ahead and rely\non that. Now, if the procedural rule is difficult and\nof uncertain application, maybe you go ahead and say,\nwell, we we're going to decide on the merits anyway.\nBut it seems to me, under your presentation,\nit's the other way around. It's a clear and easy\nprocedural rule, difficult Federal and State intertwined\nconstitutional rule, and yet the court says, well, I'm\ngoing to do the hard work rather than the easy work.\nMR. PECK: I think it was natural for the\ncourt to do that. That was the issue presented to them\nby Philip Morris. And courts do not reach out to do\nother issues. They reach -- they were being solicitous\nof Philip Morris, and they were addressing the arguments\nthat Philip Morris made. And when they decided that\nthat inured to Mrs. Williams benefit, not to Philip\nMorris's benefit, then they said we don't need to\naddress your other questions. And I think have you to\nlook at the Oregon Supreme Court noting in their own\ndecision that there was no futility here. In fact, the\nlast time we were here Philip Morris said the reason\nthey needed this instruction was because of what was\nsaid at closing argument.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What are the elements?\nImagine -- I'm trying to get help, if I were to try to\nput pen to paper on this. Suppose they win in this.\nThen we will be back at the State law issue that I\nthought was going to be there, which was the issue of --\nyou are talking about the colloquy. Did they give the\nessence of the Federal mandated instruction, or didn't\nthey? And then look how cooperative the judge was, et\ncetera. But that isn't before us now.\nWhat is before us now is something that\nblocks our consideration of that or anybody's\nconsideration of that. And imagine this is not your\ncase; imagine it is the most, you know, striking case,\nthat's why I used a death example, and we go through\nexactly the same thing. And then the court does exactly\nthe same thing, the State court, that happened here.\nAnd now what are the words that distinguish whether the\ncourt is in essence, to be colloquial, giving everybody\nthe runaround or whether the court is applying a -- an\nabsolute, clear, you know, fair, standard of State law?\nWhich really they should have gone into first and saved\neverybody a lot of trouble.\nMR. PECK: I think the easiest way to look\nat this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. PECK: -- is imagine that the statute of\nlimitations, which now bars any such suit in Oregon,\nwere brought today, after this Court's decision in\nWilliams, and imagine that Philip Morris is the\ndefendant, and at the end of the trial they offer their\nnumber 34 as it was before saying, \"This Court said that\nthey had made the right choice in asking for this\ninstruction.\"\nA trial court clearly would engage in\nreversible error if they gave that instruction because\nit materially departs from Oregon law. At the same\ntime, they could deny that instruction. They could deny\nthat instruction, and the Oregon Supreme Court would not\nviolate the mandate of this Court's decision by saying\nthat that is a correct decision on the part of the trial\nlaw court because it was not clear and correct in all\nrespects.\nAnd that is part of what distinguishes this.\nThis is still a rule that has to apply to its\ninstruction --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what they say is --\nlook at the two errors they found. One is in saying\n\"may\" instead of \"shall,\" and the other is in saying\n\"illicit profit\" instead of \"profit.\" And they are\npretty picky. So, this is very picky, they say. And\nnot only are they being picky, but they are being picky\nafter the event. And they could have raised it first,\nand they have 28 cases supporting them, but none of\nthese cases is right on point because the subject matter\nis, you know, closer bound up. And so they put all this\ntogether and say it's an unreasonable application of a\nrule that was there. And you say --\nMR. PECK: I would urge you, Justice Breyer,\nto look at the original case in 1916, the Sorenson case.\nThere the court was face with a question: If there is\nthe kernel of a correct instruction in there, is that\nadequate to ask the court to give that instruction or\nshould we insist on what they thought at the time was\nthe majority rule in the United States, that we should\ninsist on an instruction that is clear and correct in\nall respects, and that the -- that the counsel has the\nresponsibility to provide that? And they decided to go\nwith the clear and correct rule. That was the debate\nthat they had, and that debate informs this one.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Sorenson was the agent and\nthe principal, the broker who was selling some land.\nMR. PECK: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I think in that case\nthey also said, \"By the way, you've got basically the\ninstruction that you wanted, and you overlooked\" -- no,\nthat was the case where they said, \"You overlooked in\nyour instruction an important allegation of fact,\" which\nallegation was that the guy had been rehired as a\nbroker.\nMR. PECK: And there's a similar distinction\nthat makes Osborne irrelevant, which counsel suggested\nwas a -- an exemplary here.\nIn Osborne, an element of the crime had not\nbeen instructed upon. That's why there didn't have to\nbe the offer of an instruction. But the party\npresentation principle puts the onus on counsel to do\nso, and Philip Morris showed, in 2002, well before this\nCourt's decisions that they know how to do it when they\nwant to.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Peck, are you -- are\nyou asserting that our remand order was in error? After\nall, it did say, \"We remand this case so that the Oregon\nSupreme Court can apply this standard we have set\nforth.\"\nMR. PECK: And I -- I'd contend, Your Honor,\nthat the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: We didn't say it was in\nerror. I mean, there is nothing wrong with that.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PECK: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you say it's in error,\nmy next question is going to be --\nMR. PECK: I think the Oregon Supreme Court\nread that decision --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- can -- is it up to a\nState court to sit in judgment about whether our remand\norders are in error or not?\nMR. PECK: Well, I'm prepared to say that\nthe Oregon Supreme Court took that remand order to mean\nthat they had to have in place -- this was a procedural\ndue process decision -- that they had to have a\nprocedure that was fair, outcome neutral, applied --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If that's what they took it\nto mean, they were just wrong. I mean, that's not what\nit says.\nMR. PECK: Well, if you look --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The opinion concludes, \"As\nthe preceding discussion makes clear, we believe the\nOregon Supreme Court applied the wrong constitutional\nstandard when considering Philip Morris's appeal.\" And\nit goes to the constitutional issue we are talking\nabout.\nMR. PECK: When considering --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"We remand so that the\nOregon Supreme Court can apply the standard we have set\nforth,\" which has nothing to do with the issue we have\nbeen discussing this morning.\nMR. PECK: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it was wrong?\nMR. PECK: No, it was not wrong. I don't\nthink it was wrong, and here's the reason I don't think\nit was wrong: You corrected the Oregon Supreme Court\nwhen that thought that due process does not inform the\nanalysis on harm to non-parties. You corrected that\nsubstantive error, and that part is what they got wrong.\nMuch of this opinion said that they got lots\nof other things right. And so Oregon looked at it and\nsaid, \"Okay, we got that issue wrong, but there are\nother problems with this instruction that are adequate\nand independent grounds for --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's very nice, but\nthat's not what we remanded for.\nMR. PECK: You did not remand for that, but\nwhen this Court decides a constitutional issue of one\npart, it doesn't necessarily tell the court anything\ndifferent. What -- the essence of this Court's opinion\nis that where there's a significant risk of jury\nconfusion, the State has to provide a procedure and has\nflexibility in providing that procedure. There is no\nindication that the procedure for limiting instructions\ndoes not satisfy that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The problem that I think we\nall have is how do we guard, in effect, guard against\nmaking constitutional decisions which are simply going\nto be nullified by some clever device raising a\nprocedural issue or an issue of State law when the case\ngoes back? Is there any way for us to ensure against,\nin effect, a bad faith response to our decision except\nby purporting to require the State courts to follow a\ncertain order of battle in the decision of issues before\nthem so that when the case gets to us, we can be assured\nthat there is no lurking issue that has not yet been\ndecided as a matter of State law that in effect could\nthen be resurrected to nullify our decision? Is there\nany way to guard against that except by telling the\nState courts what the sequence is in which they have to\nmake decisions?\nMR. PECK: I believe there is. And I\nbelieve that it would be error to suggest to the State\nsupreme court that they must, even though prudent,\nfollow a specific sequence, simply because that would\nmean that they would have to necessarily decide every\nState law issue in the case --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I see the problem. I\nmean, that's why I raised the question, how can we\nensure --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we do that all the\ntime in cause and prejudice cases. We do it all the\ntime --\nMR. PECK: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- because of the\nimportance of the constitutional right.\nMR. PECK: I understand that, but I think\nthe adequate and independent State law ground provides\nall the protection. You assume, and I think properly\nso, that State supreme courts will operate in good\nfaith. Even in Flowers, after the fourth trip to the\nU.S. Supreme Court, were -- Alabama Supreme Court was\nstill trusted to apply the decision.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Your -- your answer\nis there is -- there is no way to guard against it\nexcept --\nMR. PECK: Except --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- by reviewing the good\nfaith of what the court does on remand.\nMR. PECK: Well, by -- by accepting that if\nthe rule that has been imposed was invoked properly by\nthe party that invoked it at the right time --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. PECK: -- that it IS firmly established\nand regularly followed, then it should satisfy the\nCourt --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it serves very little\ninterest. Nothing the trial judge would have done,\nnothing the plaintiff's counsel has done below, nothing\nthat the intermediate clause would have done, would have\n-- would have been different if they had submitted what\nthey call the \"correct in all respects\" rule.\nIf they had filed the \"correct in all\nrespects\" rule and submitted that rule -- if she had\nsaid, judge, I want to type a little piece of paper,\neverything would have been the same.\nMR. PECK: I suggest that it would be\ndifferent. I think the Oregon Supreme Court decided,\nwhen they decided that there was no futility in offering\nanother one, that it would be different. And the fact\nof the matter is that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I excluded the Oregon\nSupreme Court from my list of -- of participants who\nwould have done something differently.\nMR. PECK: But -- but -- but the fact of the\nmatter is, if after closing arguments which was the\ntrigger that Philip Morris urged upon this Court for\nneeding this substantive rule, if after -- if after that\nPhilip Morris's counsel had returned to the judge -- you\nknow, they said a few things that we think would tell\nthe jury to punish for harm to others. We don't think\nthe instruction is adequate. We will give you the same\ninstruction, that one-sentence instruction like we gave\nin Fink v. Schwarz. I believe the court would have\ngiven that instruction.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is, of course,\nanother way to protect our constitutional authority in\nthis case. We are talking about procedures for\naddressing the substantive due-process challenge to\na punitive damages award. That is the second question\npresented here.\nIf we went and granted that question and\nconsidered that issue, we would have protected our\nauthority to reach that question despite the procedural\nobjections alone. Why don't we just do that?\nMR. PECK: Well, Your Honor, of course, the\nlast time we were here you had a full briefing and even\nsome argument on that. And I -- I believe that we are\nprepared to stand on that briefing and argument.\nWe do not believe the Due Process Clause is\nan exercise in elementary school mathematics. It does\nnot tell you something about this. Here you have to\nlook at the enormity of the misconduct. And that did --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not asking you\nto argue here today the second question presented.\nMR. PECK: I understand.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if we have some\nconcern, if there is something malodorous about the fact\nthat the Oregon Supreme Court waited until the last\nminute to come up with this rule that was before it all\nthe time, which was a State court rule that you would\nexpect the State court to be addressing as a matter of\ncourse, then -- then we -- we can avoid having to\naddress what we do in a situation, having to\ncharacterize the nature of that -- that consideration,\nsimply by saying: Look, we are going to go ahead with\nthe questions presented. We can decide it in this case;\nand to avoid having to reach that, we will go ahead and\ndo it.\nMR. PECK: Well, it's -- it's certainly\nwithin this Court's power to do that. Philip Morris had\nmade a very harsh accusation in this case of bad faith\non the part of the Oregon Supreme Court. There was no\nsandbagging here. The Oregon court did not act in that\nway.\nMrs. Williams raised the State-law issues at\nevery opportunity, which is something that Philip Morris\ndenied in their petition but then conceded in their\nmerit brief. And the fact is it was before the Oregon\nCourt of Appeals. It was before the Oregon Supreme\nCourt, and we even raised it before this court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- in answer to the\nChief Justice, you are not suggesting that we should go\nahead and decide the second question when there has been\nno briefing on it?\nMR. PECK: I am not suggesting that you\ndecide the question, but I recognize the Court has the\npower to do so. Mapp v. Ohio came to this Court as a\nFirst Amendment case and came out as a Fourth Amendment\ncase.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I thought --\nMr. Peck, I thought you just told me that there has been\nfull and adequate briefing on that question.\nMR. PECK: I believe we had full and\nadequate briefing. We may not have had an opportunity\nto fully argue the case, and it's up for you to decide\nwhether or not you -- you have enough on that.\nI thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Shapiro, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SHAPIRO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJustice Breyer asked about these various cases from\nOregon, whether they provided guidance and a warning\nhere. And counsel referred to three cases, Reeve,\nOwings and then Sorenson. If you look at those cases,\nyou will see there were simple instructions proposed on\na single topic that were infected with an error\nthroughout.\nAnd the court said if there is any valid\nproportion of this instruction, it was covered by\nsomething that was said to the jury already. So there\nwas no harm in not giving that instruction.\nThat is certainly not our case. We have a\nseparately numbered paragraph dealing with the\nConstitution, which is quite apart from the statutory\nfactors.\nNow, counsel referred to the charge actually\ngiven by the court as if it provided some protection\nagainst punishment for harm to nonparties. If you read\nthat instruction, far from providing the protection that\nthe -- this Court said was obligatory, it invited global\npunishment. It told the jury they could return any\npunitive-damage award up to one hundred million dollars.\nLo and behold, they come up with eighty million dollars,\nright within the suggested range of this charge. And\nthere was no --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which portion of the\ncharge specifically are you referring to?\nMR. SHAPIRO: This is page 37a of our joint\nappendix. The -- the court concludes the amount of\npunitive damages you assess may not exceed the sum of\none hundred million dollars. And that, of course, was\nthe zone of reasonableness that the jury inferred from\nthis, suggesting a global punishment to the jury with no\nprotection.\nNow this Court said that that protection has\nto be provided. The Court said the State must insist,\nthat the State must give assurance, and it's an\nimportant constitutional right, as Justice Kennedy said.\nI don't think the State court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is your response to\nthe Chief Justice's suggestion that maybe we should\nreach the issue of due process on the amount?\nMR. SHAPIRO: We wouldn't oppose that\nbecause this is clearly excessive under what the Court\nsaid in State Farm: Where there is substantial\ncompensatory damages, one to one is something of a norm.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I wasn't asking to\nyou argue it, either but I mean I suppose the procedure\nthe parties would prefer, if we were interested in that,\nwould be for us to grant the second question and then\nhave the normal briefing in consideration.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, that -- that -- yes,\ncertainly, that -- that -- that is true. I -- I would\ncomment, too, on Justice Breyer's question about what is\nthe ultimate test here.\nThe Court has stated various criteria and\nopinions over the last century, but the -- the key ideas\nare? Was it an ambush, something that couldn't be\nanticipated?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean I will tell you my\nsubjective reaction going through these 38 cases is they\nare not quite in point, but they really take away the\nidea of the bad faith, particularly because the first\ntime what the judge said, which I didn't understand its\nsignificance then, but the judge said: Well, since the\nfirst part of that paragraph was in -- was in error\nanyway, I don't have to reach the question of whether\nthere were other mistakes under State law in the rest of\nthe instruction. They did say that the first time, I\nthink.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes, but this is the first\ntime the Court has ever taken this \"correct in all\nrespects\" rule and extended it to a completely different\ntopic, U.S. constitutional law in a separately numbered\nparagraph. And we had no notice that this had to be\nbroken out on a separate piece of paper. If we did, we\nwould have broken it out on a separate piece of paper.\nIt's just like Lee against Kemna where the Court said --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about this point\nthat was made that in 2002 that is exactly what Philip\nMorris did, give one simple, precise instruction?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, no, that instruction was\nnot harm to nonparties. That was harm for out-of-State\ninjuries. It was a different issue. And it's true the\nlawyers there did break up their instructions\ndifferently, but the pattern instruction --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- is it true that\nthey gave one simple sentence stating their position on\n-- on what harm to others, how that --\nMR. SHAPIRO: No. That's not true. That\ncase did not accept our instruction. It did not. It\naccepted the State Farm instruction, which said that\nthere can't be punishment for out-of-State harm.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but was the\ninstruction stated in a -- in a single paragraph, but\nall the other requests to charge were broken out?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes. This -- this State Farm\ninstruction was broken out. That's an option for\nlawyers. But under the pattern instruction, it's quite\nproper to put them all in one instructional basket.\nThat's what the form instructions said, and that's what\nboth parties here did.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
